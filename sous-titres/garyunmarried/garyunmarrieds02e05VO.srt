1
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:08,033
And in the final segment of this show,
I will tell you

2
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:11,872
the best thing about women's beach
volleyball here's a clue:

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:15,091
it rhymes with
"founcing foobies." Hello!

4
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,601
That oughta keep the monkeys
happy during commercial.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,791
That sports guy Vic?
There's a word for him.

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,873
It, rhymes with "Jackass."

7
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:32,360
Damn it. It's not gonna be
the same without you here, man.

8
00:00:32,443 --> 00:00:36,138
I can't believe it only took you
6 weeks to paint 500 square feet.

9
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:38,784
I admit I was probably stalling

10
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,008
cause I wanted Sasha to notice me
and put me on the air.

11
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,536
I used every trick in the contractor's
stalling handbook.

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,840
No, man, I loved it when you convinced
her that the primer need a primer.

13
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:47,911
That was good.

14
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,461
How about the day
I spent washing that brush?

15
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:54,468
Guys. Curtis, we've got
a police situation outside.

16
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:57,062
What, so you immediately assume
it has something to do with me?

17
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:00,934
- Post-racial, my ass.
- No. It's Vic. He's being arrested.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,164
All right, apparently, he's been
walking around town exposing himself.

19
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,780
That's... that's terrible.

20
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:08,994
To animals.

21
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,971
Look, that's just weird.
Do the animals Even know?

22
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,814
I mean, how does an animal
report something like that?

23
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,523
They have him on
security tape at the zoo.

24
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:21,492
He was in front of the gorilla cage,
and I don't know who started it...

25
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:23,091
Why am I explaining this?

26
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:25,549
OK, Curtis, I need you to
get in there and wrap it up.

27
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,148
- We've got 30 seconds.
- Sasha, let me do it.

28
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,837
- I'm sorry.
- What? Come on.

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,814
You've heard my demo. You know
I'm good. Let me do it. Come on.

30
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,860
This is not a radio fantasy camp.
We're on the air here.

31
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:39,629
I'm so sorry, man.
It's just, i'm the engineer.

32
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,886
I'm the guy who knows the show.
So, it only makes sense

33
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,882
that I take over, you know?
I gotta do it.

34
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,691
- You're on.
- I can't do it.

35
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,857
- What?
- I can't think of anything to say.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,026
You can't think of anything to say?
You spent all morning talking about

37
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,273
how many books you could
balance on kim Kardashian's ass.

38
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,531
Sasha, let me do it. I'll do it.

39
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,780
All right. Sorry, Curtis.

40
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,095
Hey, everybody, I'm,
well, my name's Gary.

41
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:10,116
Vic will be back in a couple of...

42
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:11,687
Months?

43
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:14,924
I can't tell you the reason why,
exactly,

44
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,291
but let's just say it rhymes with
"basturbating in front of borillas."

45
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:22,441
OK, so,
we're gonna talk some sports here.

46
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,545
I read in the newspaper this morning
that, that south African runner,

47
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:30,646
well, she tested positive
for having both male and female

48
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:33,190
parts, and now, she's banned
from competing as a woman.

49
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:36,432
I think that's terrible. They
she should be saluted. That's what...

50
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,488
If I had male and female parts,

51
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:42,276
I wouldn't be able to leave
my house long enough to train.

52
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:45,636
Just too many options there, I'm sorry.

53
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,782
It's like,
it's like being a one-man band.

54
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:51,247
You get tired of banging your drum,
you move over to the slide whistle.

55
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:53,378
That's...

56
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,628
Anyway, my name is Gary Brooks
and that's the score.

57
00:02:58,227 --> 00:02:59,286
How was that?

58
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:00,987
Thank you, Gary.

59
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,848
Forget all the horrible
things I ever said about you.

60
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:07,031
- Never said anything horrible to me.
- I said, "about you," not "to you."

61
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,511
Wait a minute.
I just did something good for you.

62
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,256
Why don't you do something nice for me?

63
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,248
Let me finish
the morning here on the air?

64
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:16,110
- I don't know...
- Time out.

65
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:18,994
I just saved your bacon.
I'm good. You know I'm good.

66
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,956
You know I never shut up,
and the only time I ever expose myself

67
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,334
to an animal is when I was peeing
in a bush that was housing

68
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:26,021
a very indignant raccoon.

69
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:31,072
OK, you get one shot.
Tomorrow morning.

70
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:34,402
Thank you!

71
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,840
You were not scared at all, were you?

72
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:39,156
You are welcome.

Team Subs-Addicts"

76
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:55,718
How great will it be if we get to do
a show together? God, I thought my life

77
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,918
peaked when I found out you could
buy shrimp that was already peeled.

78
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,997
Yeah, it's gonna be
just like the old days, man.

79
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,520
You're gonna be the pitcher
and I'm gonna be the catcher.

80
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,051
I mean not like that, not like that.

81
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:11,734
I mean,
it's more like it's more like football.

82
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,299
You know, you'll be throwing
balls and I'm the receiver.

83
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,202
Not like that, either.

84
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,707
Hey, there they are.

85
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:23,741
- What's the word, my man?
- I'll be in the bathroom.

86
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:26,199
That's a man on a mission. I get that.

87
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:30,010
Hey, dad.
For volunteer week at school,

88
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:31,890
i'm gonna video tape greetings from us

89
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,989
to uncle Mitch
and the marines in his unit.

90
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,046
So, think of something to say.

91
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,110
OK, I will. That's great, sweetheart.

92
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,243
Yeah, it feels good to volunteer.

93
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,994
Plus, it's extra credit
and I'm all over that, so.

94
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,820
Hey, before Allison comes in, don't
tell her about my radio audition, OK?

95
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:48,665
Why not?

96
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,993
Because Allison will say something like,
"why are you gonna

97
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,368
give up a good painter's job
"with a steady income

98
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,980
"to follow a radio pipe dream"
that pays half as much?"

99
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:57,797
Actually, it's 1/3 as much.

100
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,492
That's why Vic had to take
that second job at the zoo.

101
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:04,960
Gary, listen, I have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow,

102
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,510
so I can't drive the kids to school.
Can you do car pool?

103
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:10,493
No, I can't because i

104
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:14,206
you know, I'll be honest with you.
I have something else planned.

105
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,778
Something you're not willing to tell me.
So, what does that mean?

106
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,538
A game you want to watch?
A hot dog stand you haven't tried?

107
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,621
No, I...

108
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,323
How do you know I'm not taking
a new interesting class?

109
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,680
Is there a new zombie
movie opening tomorrow?

110
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:28,261
I mean, what...
What could it be?

111
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,451
It has to be something,
and something stupid.

112
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:33,186
All right, I'll take the kids to school,
all right? Just get out.

113
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,045
Gary, just one more thing.

114
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:39,337
I'm concerned about Tom. He's been
spending a lot of time in the bathroom

115
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,184
lately and, even though
I know it's appropriate for

116
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:43,500
boys his age to

117
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:44,902
do things,

118
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:48,835
He's been acting a little
anxious and defensive, so.

119
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:50,722
OK, all right.
You want me to talk to him?

120
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,181
'cause I'm very comfortable
with the human body.

121
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,461
Yeah, Curtis, I got that the summer
we all spent at the lake.

122
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:00,651
OK, so, now,
a guy can't get an all over tan?

123
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,394
I'll talk to Tommy, OK?

124
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:06,451
I'll just tell him what my dad told me,
that every time you do it,

125
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,109
a window in space opens up
and spiritual warriors

126
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,467
come out and they spread
happiness and awareness.

127
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,138
- How many drugs did your dad do?
- A lot.

128
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:18,699
I'm not sure exactly how many,
but I was the only kid whose dad

129
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:20,700
made a pipe out
of his pinewood derby car.

130
00:06:21,735 --> 00:06:24,330
All right, just,
just rember car pool tomorrow,

131
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:26,577
and I'm assuming that's a "Yes"
on talking to Tom.

132
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,260
I don't want him growing up
thinking it's something shameful

133
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,312
you have to hide in a tool shed to do.

134
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,601
What are you gonna do?

135
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,143
You can't go do your audition
if you're taking the kids to school.

136
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,663
I'm not gonna be taking my kids
to school. Someone will,

137
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:41,876
because the school has set up
a car pool

138
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,870
phone tree. You call one of the names
on this list. If they can't do it,

139
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:47,950
they call someone else and so on until
someone's taking your kids to school.

140
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:50,491
How is that like a tree?

141
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:53,169
I mean, if each person talks
to the next person,

142
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:55,748
and then they talk to the next person,
that's a phone Chain,

143
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,238
that's a phone Chain.

144
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,696
I don't know, they just,
they call it a phone tree.

145
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,106
I'm telling you,
if one person calls many people,

146
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,873
that's a tree, 'cause it branches out.

147
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:05,739
Stop. Is this gonna bother you all day?

148
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:08,479
No, no. I'm just...
I'm gonna get a beer, OK?

149
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,201
I mean, a phone train.
A phone... phone stream.

150
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:13,718
I mean, tree is the only thing
that doesn't describe it.

151
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,120
- Tom, get out of the bathroom!
- Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.

152
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:24,014
That's what you said 5 minutes ago.
What are you doing in there?

153
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,370
No matter what he's doing in there,
do you really want him to answer that?

154
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,839
- Fine.
- Get ready for school, would you?

155
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,434
Tommy, that's enough now.

156
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,891
Come on, your ride for school's here.
Let's go.

157
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,274
- What the heck's going on in there?
- OK, I don't wanna talk about it.

158
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:42,317
- Can't you just mind your own business?
- You don't have to talk about it.

159
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,533
But listen, it's no big deal.
Everybody goes through it.

160
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:46,466
I went through it,
your uncle went through it.

161
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,673
I'm not going through anything.
So, don't.

162
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,517
Relax. Look, if you happen
to find yourself going through

163
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:55,280
an exciting new chapter
in your life, just

164
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:57,783
know that every,
single man on the planet

165
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,645
has enjoyed that chapter over
and over and over again.

166
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:05,389
OK? Now, go to school, and take comfort
knowing that it has a very happy ending.

167
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,128
So, Michael Vick is back in the NFL

168
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:15,245
and, yeah, the guy
served his time in prison,

169
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,716
but I don't think this is all
gonna even out until he faces

170
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,957
a defensive line of Pit Bulls
and somebody snaps him a ham.

171
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,252
Gary, remind people to call in.

172
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:27,238
OK, everybody, don't forget to call in.
I'm Gary Brooks. This is the score.

173
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:29,713
Let's talk some sports.
All sports except for soccer.

174
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:32,598
And don't call me and tell
me how great soccer is.

175
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,309
You always say things like, "come on.

176
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:37,475
It's the most popular sport
in the entire world." Who cares?

177
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,042
Coldplay's the most popular
band in the entire world,

178
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,534
but that doesn't mean
I don't wanna light a Nickelback CD

179
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:45,338
on fire and beat Chris Martin
over the head with it.

180
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:47,787
You got a call on line 1.

181
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,631
We have allie in Marvista. She's upset.
Why are you so angry, Allie?

182
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,746
Because my stupid ex-husband
is doing a radio show,

183
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:56,500
and I got a call from the phone tree

184
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,291
asking if I could take
my own kids to school.

185
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:01,843
That's crazy.

186
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,041
Can you?

187
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:11,082
Gary, what the hell are you doing
on the radio while

188
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,215
the kids are waiting
at your house for a ride?

189
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:16,109
OK, I would explain, but you're calling
me right in the middle of my show.

190
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:19,509
I'm sorry. Am interrupting your show?
I just have one question.

191
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,217
What freakin' show, Gar?

192
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,011
The score with Gary Brooks!

193
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,066
And you're our first caller, so,

194
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,844
you win our Kobe Bryant bobblehead.
There you go.

195
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:35,742
We'll get that out to you right away.
Is your address still the gates of hell?

196
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,536
I can't believe you kept
this secret from me, Gary.

197
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,911
Allison, your reaction is the exact
reason why I didn't tell you about this.

198
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:47,438
I only get one shot at this radio gig,
and I didn't want you

199
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,056
to spoil it for me like you spoiled

200
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,634
our marriage and sex
and the endings of movies.

201
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,109
I'm not trying to spoil anything for you
but come on. A new career? Now?

202
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:59,679
I mean, would you make as much money
on the radio as you do painting?

203
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:05,484
I'm not sure.
Probably.

204
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,970
Gary, I don't understand this.
I mean, you have a good job

205
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:11,448
and you make good money.
Why would you throw all that away?

206
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,675
And for the record, I didn't ruin
that movie ending on purpose.

207
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:18,840
I just guessed that goose would die in a
traing mission and Maverick would live.

208
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,384
You know what?
For once in my life, I'm actually

209
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,663
in control here,
so, I am cutting you off.

210
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,176
Gary, keep her on.

211
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,863
People are loving the show. The phones
are lighting up like a Christmas tree.

212
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,391
OK, we got another call.
This is Keith from burbank.

213
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:35,048
Keith, what's on your mind?

214
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:38,349
Man, Gary, I hate when chicks
give away movie endings.

215
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,475
My girlfriend used to do that.

216
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,483
Except she didn't really know she was
my girlfriend, and she was a stranger.

217
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:51,305
OK. Why don't I let
allison respond to that?

218
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:53,608
Allison, why do you guys
ruin movie endings?

219
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:56,841
Please. Half those movies you said
I ruined, Stephen Baldwin

220
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,304
was already ruing.

221
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:02,440
Can we just talk
about this later, please?

222
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:06,112
Yeah, I'd love to, Alison.
But, we actually have another caller.

223
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:09,291
Look at this. We got Stu from Valencia.
Stu, you're on the score.

224
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:11,770
I've been listening to this whole
discussion. I think you're both

225
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:14,729
making really good points,
and I just have to say, Allison?

226
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:16,595
You sound hot.

227
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,102
You know what, Allison?
I know you think this dream is crazy,

228
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:23,323
but if I don't go for this right now,
when will i?

229
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,460
Probably never will.
This is my chance, and

230
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,589
guys like me
and guys like Keith out there,

231
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:29,814
guys that know what it's like
to work for a living, guys

232
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,850
that bust their butts day in and day out
they know what i'm talking about.

233
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:35,034
My whole life,
I've done what I've had to do,

234
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:38,335
and now, finally, I have a chance
to do what I want to do.

235
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:43,839
So, Allison, just so I can really
understand your side,

236
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,846
what are you?
Like, a 34c?

237
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:47,590
Bite me, Stu.

238
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:52,332
Gary? Please,
can we have an adult conversation here?

239
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,181
Yeah, that's real mature, Gar.

240
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,602
OK, you know what?

241
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,670
Just once,
I would like to talk to you...

242
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:02,987
You know what, Gary?
Gary, I'm right and you're wrong.

243
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,014
That was Allie in Marvista.

244
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,142
I'm Gary Brooks, and this is the score.

245
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,771
Oh, my god.

246
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:16,774
I'm sorry. I didn't know Allison was
gonna call in and ruin everything.

247
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:19,592
Gary, that was amazing.

248
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,556
Really? Oh, my gosh.
That's great.

249
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,765
You know,
I gotta let my bosses hear it, but

250
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:26,438
I think this is something that
I can sell to them.

251
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,880
Way to go, champ.

252
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:33,548
Man, that was awesome, man.
The phones were lighting up.

253
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,567
Most of the guys were on your side
couple of guys

254
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,016
wanted Allison's phone number.

255
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:40,261
And Nickelback called and said if there
were more of them, they'd kick your ass.

256
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,806
I believe this is actually
going to happen!

257
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,172
This is totally gonna happen.
You're gonna be the guy on top,

258
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:48,349
and I'm gonna be the guy
right underneath you.

259
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,858
Not like that, not like that.

260
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,488
Hi, KPPQ?

261
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:07,174
Yes, my name is, Steve Karisnowski and

262
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,228
and I was calling because
I really loved that guy

263
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:13,368
you had on the air this morning,
Gary Brooks was his name, I think?

264
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:16,431
Karisnowski.

265
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,430
"K"...

266
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,793
You know, just how it sounds.

267
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,199
Hello?

268
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,985
KPPQ? This is Christopher Walken, hello.

269
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,385
I'm calling 'cause of that boy
you had on the radio this morning.

270
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,866
I think his name was Gary Brooks.

271
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,948
Now, normally, I don't listen
to sports talk radio, but...

272
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,011
He made me a fan!

273
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:51,944
Keep him on the air.
I like it. I like it.

274
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,899
- Hi.
- Hey, there she is, my biggest fan.

275
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,250
What the heck were you doing
calling in to the radio show?

276
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,385
What were you doing? What? All of
a sudden, you're a radio personality?

277
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,229
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

278
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,262
I knew you would be against it.
It's your job

279
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,002
to vacuum fun out of my life.

280
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:12,913
You even have special attachment to suck
fun out of all my hard to reach places.

281
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,497
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I overreacted.

282
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,905
I just you were on the radio
and I got all panicked

283
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,065
about how we were gonna be able
to afford everything.

284
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:23,261
Gary, it's a tiny little station.

285
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,987
Will you make as much on
the radio as you do painting?

286
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:27,613
Not at first, OK?

287
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:30,847
But after a few years,
when I get my own following,

288
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:33,119
I still won't even come close.

289
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,458
Gary, there's something
I haven't told you.

290
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,711
Come on. We haven't had sex in 6 months.

291
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:48,006
No, do you rember a couple of
months ago, we sent in that application

292
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,699
for Louise to get in
to the l.A Philharmonic youth program?

293
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:52,908
Yeah, you told me it was
a super expensive

294
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,206
and prestigious.
But don't worry 'cause she won't get in.

295
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,225
She got in.

296
00:14:57,934 --> 00:15:00,453
Of course she did.
She's so darn good at everything.

297
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,679
Listen to me, this music program,

298
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:06,076
it's gonna be a stretch Even
on your painter's salary,

299
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,577
but if you quit painting
and you start making less,

300
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,658
I don't know if we'll be able
to afford it at all.

301
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,951
And I know it's a little weird for me
to say this, because

302
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,193
I don't contribute as much financially,

303
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,129
- but...
- You mean, like 0 dollars?

304
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:20,701
Jeez, Gary,
if you want to put a number on it. God.

305
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:24,336
Look, this is... This is terrible.
This radio thing is like my dream.

306
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:28,208
But I can't stand in the way of Louise.
This is super important for her. Yeah.

307
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,988
It's time to say something to uncle
Mitch and the marines in his unit.

308
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:35,876
Hey, Mitch. It's your little brother.
Come home soon. We love you.

309
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,971
Tommy's bunk bed is waiting for you.

310
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:42,888
I just wanted to say thanks
to you and everyone in your unit.

311
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,278
For your service.
And, stay safe.

312
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,073
'cause I wanna give you a great,
big hug when you come home.

313
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:49,961
Thanks. He's really gonna love that.

314
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:55,141
Tom, is there anything
that you want to say to uncle Mitch?

315
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:56,709
Can I have a little peace?

316
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,546
Tom wants peace, uncle Mitch.

317
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:09,221
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Hey. Allie.

318
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:11,612
So, listen, man,
we wanted to talk to you.

319
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,224
I think I should tell him.

320
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,433
It's probably better
coming from a buddy.

321
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:18,286
Anyway, it didn't work out.

322
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,217
Sasha tried really hard
but the guys upstairs,

323
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,654
they just didn't respond to the show.
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,683
Well.

325
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:28,162
That's what I get. It was dumb of me
to Even get my hopes up.

326
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:29,773
I'm sorry, Gar.

327
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,527
And they also said i'm
just messing with you, man.

328
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:34,687
- They loved you!
- What?

329
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,642
They loved you, Gary.

330
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,410
Congratulations.
You are the new KPPQ sports guy.

331
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,701
Hey, you should have seen your face.

332
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:45,735
It's like your heart was broken.

333
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,754
Yeah, tell him how it went down.

334
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:51,862
I gave the tape to management,
and they flipped.

335
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,878
You were Edgy, you were funny,
you knew your stuff.

336
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:57,952
And then, I made the point
that it's the kind of show that both men

337
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:01,164
and women would listen to,
which made me look like a genius.

338
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,468
So, what do you say?

339
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:08,921
I'm gonna have to say no.

340
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,391
Yes! Wait.
Hold on. What?

341
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,830
Sorry, I can't do it. Sorry.

342
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,606
Well, hold on a second.
Let me get this straight.

343
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,853
The thing you've been pestering

344
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:24,328
me to give you for the last 6 weeks,
you're now saying you don't want?

345
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,311
What are you?
A toddler?

346
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:31,415
- Look, I can't do it. I'm sorry.
- Gary, you have to do this.

347
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,204
And not just because i'm gonna look like
a giant ass to my boss if you say no.

348
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,921
But because you were born to do this.

349
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,873
I've never seen anyone enjoy
themselves doing anything

350
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:43,392
the way that I saw you
enjoy being on the radio.

351
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,646
It was like you were glowing.

352
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,834
And I don't know if I've had that
feeling doing anything in my life, ever.

353
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,558
My, my daughter

354
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:56,096
has an opportunity to do something
really incredible,

355
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:58,103
and I will not be able to
make that work

356
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:00,889
on a Dj's salary, so, I can't.

357
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:02,619
I'm sorry.
I cannot do it.

358
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:08,118
- I'm really upset to hear that.
- Hang on. Sasha, just.

359
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:10,391
Gary, can I talk to you for a second?

360
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:15,758
What?

361
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:19,955
- You gotta take the job.
- I can't.

362
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:21,759
How are we gonna pay for Louise program?

363
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:25,440
I don't know. Gary, we'll figure it out.
We'll save, we'll stretch.

364
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:27,393
I don't know, but you gotta do it.

365
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:29,521
It'll make you really happy.

366
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,186
Is this a trap?

367
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,546
No, look. You may not believe this
but I want you to be happy.

368
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,917
And not just because I care about you.

369
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,657
But because if you're happy, Gary,

370
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,567
the family is happy.

371
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,250
And what could be more inspiring
to the kids than seeing their dad

372
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,994
doing something he loves?

373
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:51,360
We're just gonna make it work.

374
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:55,126
Yeah, this... This has "trap"
written all over it.

375
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,833
Hey, guys, listen.

376
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:03,530
I'm sorry. I really tried,
but he doesn't want to do it.

377
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:05,974
What? He's giving this up?
This is the chance of a lifetime.

378
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,829
I can't believe he's turning this down.

379
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:11,693
Which is why I'm not throwing it away.
I'm messing with you! I'm doing it!

380
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:16,608
- I am your new sports guy.
- This is so great!

381
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:22,332
Please, feel free to call in
as often as you like, all right?

382
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,569
Do you guys think you can find
something to fight about every day?

383
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:28,288
Gee, I don't know.
It might be a little rough, but

384
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,377
we'll get it together once
the cameras are rolling.

385
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,463
But it's not cameras, Gary. It's radio.

386
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,780
I knew you were gonna say that.
The second I said the word "camera,"

387
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:38,003
I knew you were gonna correct
me in front of my friends.

388
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,162
This is... This is perfect.

389
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:42,213
This is perfect.
I love it.

390
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:43,755
Welcome aboard.

391
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:48,073
Well, congratulations, Gary.

392
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,472
- You finally got your own show.
- I got my own show!

393
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,703
Just like we said.
Man, it's gonna be you and me.

394
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:56,005
All right? You're gonna be the hot dog
to my bun. But not like that.

395
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,040
I gotta thank you.

396
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:04,334
If you weren't a royal pain in my ass,
my dream never would have come true.

397
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,354
No! Oh, my god, this is terrible!

398
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:12,039
Oh, my god.
What?

399
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,093
I can't believe this is how it ends!

400
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,284
What?

401
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:19,690
- Honey, you don't like the ending?
- Oh, god!

402
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:22,726
Gary, call the doctor.
He's crying. He's crying.

403
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:24,970
All right, that's enough now.
Tommy, I'm coming in now.

404
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:27,017
Come on.
Enough's enough. I'm com...

405
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:32,877
Gary, do lave.
That could be very damaging right now.

406
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,182
Oh, my gosh. You won't believe what
he's been doing in here.

407
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,800
He's reading "bridges
of madison county."

408
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:43,095
I didn't want anyone to know.

409
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,932
- Honey, that's, like, the saddest book.
- Yeah, I know.

410
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:48,194
- And dad said it had a happy ending.
- All right.

411
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:51,870
That's a relief. Isn't it?

412
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,524
Yeah, It's Kinda weird he's reading
that book in the bathroom.

413
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,810
I hope when he does the other thing,
he doesn't start doing in the library.

414
