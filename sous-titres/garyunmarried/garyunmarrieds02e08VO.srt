00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,506
Good news! I'm coming to
your house for Thanksgiving.

2
00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:11,292
That's fantastic. What happened to you
going to Charlene's parents' house?

3
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:13,487
Yeah, I'm not really
welcome there anymore

4
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,954
since I was Charlene's dad's
Pictionary partner.

5
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,786
I'm sorry,
but how would you draw a cockatoo?

6
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:24,443
I've been there, man.
I had to draw manhole.

7
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:30,376
Curtis, hold up. When you're at my house
will you fix my car stereo?

8
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:32,005
You want me to work on Thanksgiving?

9
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:33,950
I could charge you $50
for turkey and beer.

10
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,421
I will be there at 2:00 with my tools.

11
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:40,534
You look awful.

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:41,699
Excuse me?

13
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:44,154
Anybody can tell a woman in
a beautiful dress how pretty she is.

14
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:46,455
I pride myself in standing
apart from the pack.

15
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,298
How's that strategy working out for you?

16
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,107
Judging by the look on your face,
oh and one.

17
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,048
I'm sorry.
I'm distracted.

18
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:59,370
The girlfriend I was supposed to go
to this event with canceled on me.

19
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,805
Apparently,
she's in the hospital for observation.

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,567
Which means new boobs.

21
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:08,795
I could go. I've got a suit jacket
in the back of my van I could febreze.

22
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,158
Thanks. I just don't think
you'd have a good time.

23
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:14,434
You know, it's an alumni thing
for my college, so

24
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,563
it's just a bunch
of Chatty Academic types.

25
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,772
What makes you think I wouldn't
fit in with that crowd?

26
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:21,621
Just 'cause I was born in the back
of an el camino and I

27
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:26,001
grew up eating fluffernutter and I wore
a bathing suit that used to be jeans?

28
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:29,583
Gary, I am sorry.
I didn't mean to sound judgmental.

29
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:31,190
I just don't think you'd have fun.

30
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:33,733
I'm just tired of the stereotype,
that working-class guys,

31
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:35,368
blue-collar guys like me

32
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,404
don't enjoy the arts or literature or...

33
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,101
paintings or books.

34
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:46,954
Look, I really appreciate the offer.
It's just easier for me to go by myself.

35
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,738
OK? I'm gonna grab my coat.

36
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:53,190
You know, if you and I ever get to hang
out after work, you know, have a drink,

37
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:54,641
get to know each other,

38
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:58,031
you're gonna know how wrong you are
about people like me. For example,

39
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:02,182
you might be surprised to learn
that I know quite a bit about wine.

40
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:04,955
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,625
This puppy right here has a,

42
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:11,163
that's nice. Hint of plum.
Nice kick to it. Good legs.

43
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:17,441
Allison and I took a wine tasting
class a few years back.

45
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:18,764
I bet you're surprised.

46
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,185
I meant,
oh my God,

47
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,986
you just opened the $800 Bordeaux

48
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,688
I was supposed to bring
to the silent auction tonight.

49
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:31,763
Oh, my God.

50
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:34,945
Here. I'll spit it in the hole.

54
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:49,191
It's like there's no gray area with
Sasha. If you didn't go to some

55
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,639
Fancy prep school
then you're some lowlife on "cops"

56
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:54,212
who threw a can of pork and beans
through his neighbor's windshield

57
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:56,864
'cause he thought that
you stole his boa constrictor.

58
00:02:57,671 --> 00:02:59,928
How come white people
always have their shirts off

59
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,872
when they're about to get arrested?

60
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:05,198
I mean, you get tackled in the lawn,
and then you got grass all over you,

61
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:06,998
and you gotta go to Jail all Itchy.

62
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:10,907
If you're gonna break the law,
put clothes on. Have some pride.

63
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:14,285
That's an excellent point,
Curtis. Listen,

64
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:18,364
I overheard Sasha saying she has
no plans for Thanksgiving, so I'm going

65
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:21,807
to invite her to my house show her I'm a
classy guy with a great sense of humor.

66
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:26,882
No, I'm being serious.
I'm having... that's my plan.

67
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:29,552
I'm sorry, my man.
Good luck, buddy. I believe in you.

68
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,504
You don't have to apologize again.

69
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,670
Come on.
Didn't you get all my e-mails?

70
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,065
Unless there's another
"Garylicious71" out there

71
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,918
- yes, I did, thank you.
- What are you doing for Thanksgiving?

72
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,266
You want to come to my house? Curtis
is coming over. The kids will be there.

73
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:50,281
Actually my great-aunt invited me over
with her and all her bridge friends.

74
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,090
It's like eating with the cast
of "Cocoon," but

75
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,181
but she does make a killer Osso Buco,

76
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,824
which is my favorite thing ever.

77
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:01,101
Osso Buco, are you kidding me?

78
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:04,660
Hey, what has 2 thumbs
and iss the king of Osso Buco?

79
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:07,062
This guy.

80
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,210
I make the best Osso Buco in the world.

81
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,752
Are you kidding me? Come on.
Come to my house. It'll be fantastic.

82
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:16,837
You... OK,
you are going to make Osso Buco?

83
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,119
I already bought
the buco and everything.

84
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,823
Come on. What do you say?

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,915
- I don't think so.
- Well, hold on a second.

86
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,194
Maybe...

87
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:30,038
Maybe this will change your mind.

88
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:36,765
- Oh, my God.
- That's right.

89
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,858
Gary, you replaced my Bordeaux?

90
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:43,080
I know how much this costs

91
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,261
and how much I pay you, and,

92
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,408
I think it's the same number.

93
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:51,360
So what do you say?
Will you come?

94
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:56,038
Fine.
I'll be there.

95
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,629
- All right.
- Thank you.

96
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:58,732
You're welcome.

97
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,829
You spent $800 on a bottle of wine,
and you can't pay me back the $10

98
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:06,379
you borrowed from me on the boardwalk to
get your name written on some of rice?

99
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,193
It's not an $800 bottle of wine.

100
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,980
OK? It's a $15 bottle of wine
that I bought at the drugstore,

101
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,916
and I just put the label on top.

102
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:19,284
That's pretty smart.

103
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:23,526
You bought a $15 bottle of wine, and you
won't pay me back the $10 you owe me

104
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:25,326
for putting your name
on a piece of rice?

105
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,541
The guy didn't even do good job
with the grain of rice.

106
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:29,551
He didn't spell my whole name
he left the R out.

107
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,615
I own a grain of rice that says "gay."

108
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:43,193
Tommy boy. You ready to spend
the Holidarayri ed with your dad?

109
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:46,120
That's a cute baby.
I should not have let your mom

110
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,172
give you the sex talk, considering
it's her least favorite subject.

111
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,367
Actually, it's his assignment
for health class over the holiday.

112
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:57,458
And while I'm away with Howard, you have
to make sure that he doesn't neglect it.

113
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:01,151
Yeah, it's computerized, and it monitors
everything I do 24 hours a day.

114
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:02,722
Yeah, I've been there.

115
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,768
But then I got my own house.

116
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,293
Louise, you still got gandhi.
Did you find a home for him yet?

117
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,808
Not yet. And I don't want
to leave him at the shelter.

118
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,366
But it's not so bad,
except for when he pees on the floor.

119
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,077
Yeah, I've been there, honey.

120
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:20,182
But then I got my own house.

121
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:26,572
You guys get all your stuff together and
come on over to dad's for Thanksgiving?

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,762
- Louise, help me out for a second.
- Yeah, sure.

123
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,145
Grab this... all right.

124
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:34,898
Look, should I just
cancel my trip tomorrow?

125
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:37,375
I mean, I could meet
howard's family another time.

126
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,707
I've never spent Thanksgiving
away from the kids before.

127
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,815
Don't feel guilty about it, Allison.
You've raised 2 great kids,

128
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:45,875
you know, and you've done it all while
keeping your sense of perspective.

129
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,121
Your body's fit and toned,
your skin is clear.

130
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:50,191
- You've got nice eyes...
- What? What do you want?

131
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,906
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

132
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:55,352
Do you want me to get you a new Michael
Buble CD so no one see you buying it?

133
00:06:58,405 --> 00:07:00,229
Are you serious?
Did another one drop?

134
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,211
- I got another problem. Have a seat.
- All right.

135
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,669
Look, my boss... Sasha,

136
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,757
she tends to think I'm like
this low-class buffoon.

137
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,098
That's it.
That's the problem.

138
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,541
So I...
I want to impress her for Thanksgiving

139
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:19,038
by making Osso Buco,
so I need you to help me with that.

140
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:22,257
I would also like you to tell me,
what is Osso Buco?

141
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,495
I don't know, and Curtis told me
he was the center for the jets.

142
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:31,063
Osso Buco is a Veal Shank,
Gary, and I can't.

143
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:33,695
I got a million things to do before
I go to San Francisco with Howard.

144
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,318
And like I used to tell you in bed,

145
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,997
you should never promise
something you can't deliver.

146
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:43,848
And like I used to tell you in bed,
don't worry. I'll finish this myself.

147
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:52,067
C-U-M-I-N.

148
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,971
That cannot be pronounced
the way it's spelled.

149
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,243
- There he is.
- Hey, dad!

150
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,262
Hi! I missed you, gosh.

151
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:03,702
Where the heck have you been?

152
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,871
I've been hiking in the high sierras.

153
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,611
Nothing but the clothes on my back,
and, well, my

154
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:12,365
baggie of what I like to call
"baja mind-expander."

155
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:13,731
Terrific.

156
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:16,417
Let me get you a beer.
You look thirsty, OK?

157
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,080
Look, my boss from work
is coming over. She's a pretty gal.

158
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:22,471
Do me a favor.
Just be on your best behavior, OK?

159
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,051
Hey, no problem with that.
I even got dessert.

160
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,355
Dessert?

161
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:27,983
Brownies.

162
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:32,385
- That's not going to fly this year.
- No, this is not what you think.

163
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,567
- It's peyote.
- Peyote?

164
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,890
Come on.
Put that away.

165
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,384
Finish your beer. I'll tell

166
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,416
the grandkids what's left
of their grandfather is here, OK?

167
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,581
Your grandpa is here.
Oh, my gosh.

168
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:48,598
This place is a mess.
I asked you guys to help me clean up.

169
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,866
What happened?

170
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:53,246
Tom left his baby crying while he was
playing video games so I had to walk it.

171
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,327
- Call me, dad?
- Tom had a baby?

172
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,035
How long have I been away?

173
00:08:58,244 --> 00:08:59,122
Hi, grandpa.

174
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,307
It's Tom's baby.
He's supposed to be taking care of it.

175
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,252
Louise, would you please give
the baby back to its rightful owner?

176
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,335
Fine.

177
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:08,232
I can't take this thing crying. Please,
Tom, pick the baby up, would you?

178
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,020
It's too tough OK?
I can't have any fun.

179
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,486
I have to keep this stupid
thing alive all day.

180
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,354
You didn't want the responsibility
you should have pulled out.

181
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,471
Of the assignment.

182
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:23,489
Come on, you guys. Clean up the house?
I gotta go finish the Osso Buco.

183
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:25,797
Well, why aren't we having turkey?
It's Thanksgiving.

184
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:28,738
Turkey? Tom, my boss is coming over.
It's gotta be extra special.

185
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:31,854
Dad, I have thought about this, and I
don't want to eat an animal that's been

186
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,941
kept in a tiny cage its whole life just
because you're crushing on your boss.

187
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,907
You don't have to.
Grandpa bought brownies.

188
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,878
You're gonna love this stereo.
You're not going to believe

189
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:47,622
how loud this thing is.
Be warned...

190
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,158
When you stop at a red light,
you are going to get some dirty looks

191
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,154
and some nasty comments
about this thing.

192
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:53,329
That's all right.

193
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,761
Wait till they find out I'm old, white
and rocking out to Michael Buble.

194
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,328
I'm running late. Gosh,
Sasha's going to be here in an hour.

195
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,333
I am so far behind.
I got all these things that says class.

196
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:07,930
Look at this...
Scented candle right there

197
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,790
Jazz CD.
It even says "evening Jazz."

198
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,774
And very fancy, intelligent magazines.

199
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:19,007
I going to spread the across the house.
She'll think that I read them. And like

200
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,685
real fancy. The cartoons
aren't even funny, you know?

201
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:25,983
My man, let me show you
the piece de resistance. Here we go.

202
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:30,326
- Osso Buco 'A la Brooks'.
- I got the recipe off of a website.

203
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,941
This is the first time you've ever
cooked yourself without the aid of

204
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:37,132
boyardee, butterworth,
or that white talking glove.

205
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,971
Have a taste there. What do you think?

206
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:44,373
Oh, my God. It's pretty good?
How much salt did you put in this?

207
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:47,859
I don't know, I ballparked it.
This is about 2 teaspoons, right?

208
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:48,942
Just...

209
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,701
- Why, is it too much?
- Not if Sasha's part deer.

210
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:02,619
Oh, my God! I can't serve this.
It's like beefy seawater.

211
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:07,395
Oh, my gosh.
Sasha's going to be here in 59 minutes.

212
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,969
All right, you know what? Time to bring
in the big guns. Give me your keys.

213
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,250
Gary! What are you doing here?

214
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,086
I need your help with dinner. It's an ER

215
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:20,514
I thought you found a recipe.

216
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,619
But I can only serve it if I'm going
to use it to rim Margarita glasses.

217
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,725
What?

218
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,372
It went horribly wrong.
I need your help. Help me.

219
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:30,227
I'm sorry. I can't. My flight
to San Francisco leaves in a few hours.

220
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,556
- I gotta finish getting ready.
- I'm begging you, Allison!

221
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,566
Otherwise my dinner
with Sasha is ruined!

222
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:37,310
- Gary, I can't do it!
- OK, that's fine.

223
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:40,580
I thought we were going to do this the
easy way. We'll just do it the hard way.

224
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:44,358
You just go over there for a second.
I'll, Hi Jack your luggage.

225
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,592
OK. Really?
Really, Gary?

226
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,399
You know, I'm going for 2 nights.
I could just wear this if I had to.

227
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:52,215
I didn't want to say this, Allison,
but Tom and Louise,

228
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,055
they really, really
wanted to see you before you leave,

229
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:58,257
and it was tom who came to me today
with tears in his eyes saying, "dad,

230
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,745
"how do any of us know how many
Thanksgivings any of us even have left?"

231
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:05,748
And I thought, the wisdom of kids.

232
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,604
You're not going to guilt me into this.

233
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,693
We'll see.

234
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:13,862
Crap.

235
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,687
The house is clean. Curtis is almost
done with the van. How the lamb coming?

236
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,548
It's fine. You know, we're really lucky
we found a rack of lamb at this hour.

237
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:28,987
Smells good. How's it look? Oh, my gosh!
That looks amazing!

238
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,812
Gary, you really owe me on this one.

239
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,382
I was thinking of a thank-you card,
but all right, let's make it quick.

240
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:41,205
God, please! Don't make me nauseous.
I gotta fly in an hour.

241
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,315
Then what the heck did
you take this off for?

242
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:46,719
What? I'm getting started on the pies.
I don't want to get flour on my dress.

243
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,710
Great. You're making pies.
Good. Keep helping.

244
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:50,682
I really need tonight to be special.
Thank you.

245
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,929
I cannot believe you
have a crush on Sasha.

246
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:56,409
It's going to be like beauty and
he beast, except when she kisses you,

247
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:57,901
this won't change back.

248
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,373
- Would you just make pies?
- Look, 10 minutes.

249
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,850
Finished or not, I am out
the door getting ready for my trip.

250
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,173
10 minutes, that's all I need.
That's great.

251
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,360
OK, let'cbs ssee her fly without this.

252
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,146
Dad, come on.

253
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:22,422
The water heater is ancient.
You cannot take showers that hot.

254
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:24,468
I haven't showered yet.

255
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:29,715
Oh, God!

256
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:31,239
Oh, my goodness!

257
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,477
You're gonna get us all arrested!
Put some clothes on.

258
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,052
My boss is coming over.
And puka shells do not count as a shirt!

259
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,751
Oh, my gosh!
The dog peed on the couch!

260
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:45,698
Tom, Louise, I thought gandhi was
a nonviolent dog, look at this!

261
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:47,402
It's all over my couch!

262
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,279
What is all the shouting about?

263
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:53,006
Hey, dad, I need you to
push these tables together.

264
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,682
I need you to put ice in the glasses,

265
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,378
and I need you to take the salt
and pepper out of the ceramic footballs

266
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,712
and put them in the good salt
and pepper shakers, OK?

267
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:01,482
Forget it.

268
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:04,486
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you! OK.

269
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:06,845
No, you have to take care of the baby.
It's your assignment.

270
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,337
- You're better at it.
- What, because i'm a woman?

271
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,346
When did you get so patriarchal, Tom?

272
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,080
Since forever.
What's wrong with loving your country?

273
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,639
- What is that?
- It's ratt!

274
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:28,808
And it's way too loud!

275
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,090
OK, there's a short in the electrical
system. I can't turn the music off.

276
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:36,170
You have to. Mr. Biscazzi next door
has a real itchy 9-1-1 finger, OK?

277
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:37,988
You gotta figure out
a way to turn it off.

278
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:40,461
I would love to, but I kind
of locked the keys in the van.

279
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,589
All right, we'll have to
Jimmy the door open somehow.

280
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:46,088
Louise, take the dog upstairs.
Tom, help your mom.

281
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:48,626
Hey, do me a favor, Curtis.
Help me take this couch outside.

282
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,618
But be careful, it's covered in pee.

283
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,351
How are we going to get this huge
thing through that tiny opening?

284
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:57,255
Hang on a second. Let me call Charlene.

285
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:01,941
- She works at Ikea!
- Go on. OK, go ahead.

286
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:06,741
How do you not know how
to install a stereo?

287
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,641
You're a professional sound engineer!

288
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,053
It's your van, man.

289
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:12,873
Your whole electrical system
is Jerry-rigged. You got the wipers

290
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:15,272
connected to the headlights
connected to the air conditioning.

291
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:18,254
If you want to honk the horn,
you gotta move the passenger seat back.

292
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,792
Let's just figure it out. Please.
Sasha's going to be here any minute.

293
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,019
Great.

294
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,891
I told you. I'm not going to
tolerate with any more of this noise.

295
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,777
Sorry, Mr. Biscazzi.
We're trying to turn it off.

296
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,317
Well, it's too late.
This has escalated.

297
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,189
- The cops are on their way.
- What?

298
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:38,519
No cops! We don't want cops.
OK, I think I got it.

299
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,272
Jeez, Louise! Fire!

300
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,933
- I'm getting a fire extinguisher.
- I got a broken leg here!

301
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,755
What would you do
if this was a real baby?

302
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,512
I'd be happy, 'cause that
would mean I was getting some.

303
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,952
Push the tables together
put ice in the glasses!

304
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,253
Hey! Come on.
Make pies, would you?!

305
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:00,806
- Where's my dress, Gary?
- Just keep making pies!

306
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,586
Hey, ice cubes, saltshakers...

307
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,328
And police.
Perfect.

308
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:11,986
Hey, officer, we're trying
to get the music turned off.

309
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:14,014
<i>Put down the fire extinguisher.</i>

310
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,253
I would, but it's still
smoldering right next to you.

311
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:19,445
<i>Drop where you are
and put your hands up.</i>

312
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:22,813
<i>And turn around.</i>

313
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:27,817
Sasha, hi. Welcome.

314
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,939
- You have to take responsibility!
- I never wanted it in the first place!

315
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:35,725
- Gary, where the hell is my dress?
- Shut up, Allison.

316
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:40,348
Shut up? I slave over this dinner for
you, and that's the way you talk to me?

317
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,532
Someone stole my weed.

318
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:49,790
Gary, is this a bad time?

319
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:52,060
- Sasha, here's the thing...
<i>- Hands up.</i>

320
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:56,263
Do you have to speak through the PA?
We're 5 feet from each other.

321
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:07,505
Sorry that took so long.
They had to run my ID,

322
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:11,951
and then there was a tiny, tiny,
tiny, tiny complete body search.

323
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,280
The lamb's burned.
This is a mess.

324
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:20,260
Look, Gary,
I should probably tell you

325
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,436
that was the most awesome
thing I have ever witnessed!

326
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,036
You don't think I'm one of those guys on
"cops" that gets his pants pulled down

327
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,431
by the police dog?

328
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:34,216
Of course I don't think
you're one of those guys.

329
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:37,710
Though they did wait a long time
before calling that dog off.

330
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:41,267
But come on, Gary.
You have to see how funny this is.

331
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:43,506
Do you know how many times
I've wondered who those

332
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:45,681
police helicopters
were shining their lights on?

333
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,013
OK, that was us!
We were those people!

334
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:53,806
- Do you want to stay for dinner?
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.

335
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:57,658
We got original, extra crispy,
mashed potatoes,

336
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:01,106
corn on the cob.
And they threw in a chocolate cake

337
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,873
because we were their only
customers on Thanksgiving.

338
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:08,022
What do you say?
Will you stay for dinner?

339
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,386
I would love to.

340
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:13,221
And not just because of the fried
chicken. But, that's a big draw.

341
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:17,386
Welcome to Thanksgiving in meth country.

342
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:24,841
You would hate Thanksgiving at my house.
It's so uptight.

343
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:26,562
Your family

344
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,387
yells and laughs and tells stories.

345
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:33,780
And I can't believe i'm going to say
this, but, I'm still Kinda hungry.

346
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,567
That actually might
be the munchies. Dad!

347
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,913
If you're going to smoke,
go behind the house!

348
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,867
I am behind the house!

349
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:43,448
So you really had a good time?

350
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,392
Gary, I don't know how much
you know about women, but

351
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:49,163
a guy who makes an effort,
very important.

352
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,859
Hey, I brought you something.

353
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:58,169
It's the wine you bought me.

354
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:00,673
Special wine for a special occasion.

355
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,341
I'm not sure how special it really is.

356
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:09,328
Are you kidding? This is a primo bottle
of wine. Do you have a corkscrew?

357
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,711
We're not gonna need it.
It's a screw top. Look.

358
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,357
I just glued another
label on top of the cheap one.

359
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,463
Smooth.

360
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,292
I haven't said what
i'm thankful for yet.

361
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:26,334
I'm thankful that I work with someone

362
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,925
generous enough to
invite me into his home when

363
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,975
he knew that I had nothing to do...

364
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,134
and

365
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:34,867
who went to a lot of trouble
to make sure I had a good time.

366
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:36,520
Pretty classy.

367
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,304
I'm your boss.

368
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,918
That's what makes it so hot.

369
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,019
Hey, kids.

370
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:48,979
Man.

371
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,565
Gary, thank you for letting me stay.

372
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,395
I don't think I'm ready to
leave the kids on a holiday.

373
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:57,193
But now I've got no way of getting
home, although your dad

374
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,862
did offer to take me
on his magic carpet.

375
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,889
There's a bus stop like 2 streets away.

376
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,081
You know, Allison, I can take you.

377
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:10,482
Really?
Thank you.

378
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,145
It's getting late, so I'll,

379
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:15,045
- I'll see you monday.
- All right.

380
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,250
Hey, Allison, wait a second.

381
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:23,320
You really saved me tonight.

382
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,531
I mean, you really saved me.
And I want you to have this

383
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:28,327
special bottle of wine.

384
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,347
Oh, my God.

385
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,150
Gary, thank you. This is
an incredible bottle. Are you sure?

386
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,566
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's very expensive, also.

387
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,108
And, it's Thanksgiving,
and it's the least I could do.

388
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:39,720
Thank you.

389
00:20:41,552 --> 00:20:44,049
You know what? I forgot.
I got you that Michael Buble CD...

390
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,275
Sasha's looking.
Don't do it right now.

391
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:49,190
Sasha's... wait till she turns.
Wait till...

392
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,875
OK, she's looking down, give it to me.
Yes! This is the one with bonus tracks!
