1
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:11,103
Great. I caught you in the middle
of arts and crafts.

2
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:14,422
I was afraid i'd interrupt
you during snack or nap time.

3
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:18,753
I'm making headphones for my ears.
The DWP is tearing up the street.

4
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:21,982
You know there's actually something more
annoying than the sound of your voice.

5
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:25,583
That's very funny, Gary.
But, you know, i'm the one who...

6
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:33,313
Which is why
I faked it 9 out of 10 times.

7
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:38,151
I didn't know there was going
to be construction going on.

8
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:40,540
How am I supposed to get
my homework done with all this noise?

9
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:42,846
I agree.
That's why I didn't bring mine home.

10
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,478
Well, they're all yours, Gary.
And your son Tom is grounded.

11
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:48,662
Oh, my gosh.
Is this about the fireworks?

12
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,102
- Hey, no...
- What?

13
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:51,468
What? What?

14
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,009
He said a bad word.

15
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:55,507
- What did I tell you about swearing?
- I know.

16
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:58,078
Check for parents,
teachers, preachers, and cops.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,418
Learn it.
Know it.

18
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:02,524
You gotta live it, man.

19
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,762
Hey, what word did he say?
Was it the

20
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:09,182
same word I said on our first date when
you asked, "what should we do next?"

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,701
It was the same word that my dad said
under his breath when you said, "i do."

22
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:20,412
- I'll make sure he stays in, OK?
- Thank you.

23
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,127
And you'll be proud to know that Louise

24
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:26,488
was invited to Jenny Stevens'
roller-skating party this weekend.

25
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:28,317
Louise! Finally!

26
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:31,678
Yeah! You're one of the popular girls.
That's great.

27
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:34,282
Gary, you didn't let me finish.

28
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,664
Louise declined the invitation.

29
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:39,318
She doesn't have to conform
to the popular crowd.

30
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,294
I have raised an independent young
lady who thinks and acts for herself.

31
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,444
Yeah. I think you mean "we" have raised.

32
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,441
"Our" daughter is independent. Right?

33
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:52,656
You're right, Gary. I mean,
it was you who forgot to pick up Louise

34
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,555
at the library when she was 8 years old,

35
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:57,184
which taught her all
the ins and outs of city transit.

36
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:58,785
Bye, mom!

37
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,121
I'm going to that party, dad.

38
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:06,288
- You just said you were not gonna go.
- No. Mom just said I wasn't.

39
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,951
She does that to you, too?!

40
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:11,625
I want to go, but I can't tell mom.

41
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:14,760
She's so proud I'm not the kind of
kid who succumbs to peer pressure.

42
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:17,303
But just this once,
I want to succumb.

43
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:20,130
Can we just not tell her?

44
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,924
I don't know what "succumb" means,
so you're probably OK on that.

45
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,717
But as far not telling your mother we
made an agreement when we got divorced

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,438
that we would tell each other everything
all the time. I'm sorry, Louise.

47
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,012
Please, daddy. This is finally
a chance for me to fit in.

48
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:32,943
Mom just doesn't understand.

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,651
Can't a daughter just have
one secret with her dad?

50
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:39,021
You know I can't say no to that look.
It's that same look that made me buy

51
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:40,787
that hamster for you. Which, to this day

52
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,996
I swear to god, he walked directly
into the vacuum cleaner by himself.

53
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:47,028
- Yes! Thank you, daddy.
- You're welcome, sweet girl.

54
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:50,116
And I need to get some skinny jeans,
a tank top, and some cute shoes.

55
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,112
Yeah. You got it.
You got it.

56
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:55,275
There are some words, Tom,
I have no defense for...

57
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,415
"daddy" and...

58
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:00,079
"breakfast served all day."

59
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,693
Hey, some of the guys were thinking
about hitting a movie tonight.

60
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,267
Any chance I could go?

61
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:07,593
Daddy?

62
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:11,023
Are you serious?

63
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,262
Breakfast served all day.

64
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,941
-= 209 =-
"Gary Keeps a Secret"

65
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,268
Sub VO :   ¤Aka¤

66
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:24,316
Team Subs-Addicts"

67
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,810
Louise said she wanted skinny jeans,
but on this website,

68
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:31,191
every pair of jeans looks skinny.
Is there any such thing as fat jeans?

69
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,491
I don't know. Google it.

70
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,383
Come on, now.

71
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,428
That can't even be legal.

72
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:46,135
Do me a favor. Bookmark that, though.
Just... Just asking.

73
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,267
I'm in over my head here.

74
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:54,015
I'm in, like, mommy territory...
Little girl jeans, popular girl parties.

75
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:58,153
You know who might be able to help.
Why don't you ask Sasha?

76
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,362
Sasha's not a mom.

77
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,272
Yeah, but she's got all the mommy parts.

78
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,666
They're just a little...
Firmer than Allison's.

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,675
- My ex-wife you're talking about, man.
- I'm sorry.

80
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,171
And I like it!

81
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:14,198
Why don't you just
ask Sasha to help you out?

82
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:17,080
I don't know. After Thanksgiving,
she saw all the baggage,

83
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:20,884
how crazy my family is. Plus we had that
almost-kiss. Everything got weird.

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,490
Man, white people.

85
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:26,136
Y'all make everything so complicated.
Look.

86
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:28,255
You need a woman to help
you pick some clothes out.

87
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,307
There's a woman 10 feet away.
Just ask her for help.

88
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:34,084
And this time, please
resist the urge to suck her down

89
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,118
like she's the last drop of grape soda.

90
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:38,649
Grape soda.

91
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:40,349
Black people.

92
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:48,557
Uncool.

93
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,848
- But I like it.
- Man!

94
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:58,496
What's up?

95
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:01,502
I seem to have found myself
in a bit of a pickle.

96
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:04,159
I have a problem,
and if you have any free time...

97
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:07,895
Look, I know where this is going,
and I do not help people dog-sit,

98
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:11,230
move, or pop things in an area
they cannot reach themselves.

99
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,474
My daughter,
she got invited to a cool kid party.

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,399
She doesn't have the right clothes
to wear. I need your help shopping.

101
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,784
- Could you do that for me?
- Are you kidding me?

102
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:24,030
Are you asking me if
I want to go shopping?

103
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:26,095
The answer is yes.

104
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:29,755
There's a really great store on
third street called diva-station.

105
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,329
Want to meet there at 3:00?

106
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,797
- I just thought after Thanksgiving...
- Please. Don't even worry about that.

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,009
Thanksgiving is such a crazy holiday.

108
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,107
You've got marshmallows on potatoes.

109
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,576
You're jamming your hand
inside a turkey tush.

110
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,551
Really, we're good.
It's just shopping.

111
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,469
- So, I'll meet you at 3:00.
- Perfect.

112
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:48,442
Are you as hot as I am right now?

113
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,558
- Excuse me?
- Stab in the dark. See you at 3:00.

114
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:59,357
- How about this one?
- Weren't you just wearing that one?

115
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,370
No, dad.
I was just wearing this one.

116
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,058
I can't tell these outfits apart,
Louise. They look too much alike.

117
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:09,067
It's like that "spot the difference"
game in the newspaper.

118
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,017
Maybe if one of them had a mustache on,
I'd be better at it. You know?

119
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,237
OK, I'm gonna go try something else on.

120
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:16,876
Whatever you want.

121
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:26,794
Am I in trouble?

122
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:30,606
Yes. That's strike one. Strike two,
we turn up the Avril Lavigne.

123
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:34,171
Well, I've been warned.

124
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:38,558
I've been watching you and your
daughter, and you guys are so adorable.

125
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,703
You mean, the way she talks
to me like I'm an idiot?

126
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,212
Yeah. You must be swooning.

127
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,921
So, is there a Mrs. "Cute guy
who's shopping with his daughter"?

128
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:53,297
No, but there's a boss of mine
that might come through the door

129
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,830
in about a second
that I'm hoping to have a date with.

130
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,911
That's too bad, because we're having
a sale on "single sales girls

131
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:04,282
who want to make out with you behind
the wetzel's pretzels dumpster."

132
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,737
Maybe I could get, like, a coupon?

133
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,529
I couldn't find the jeans
at Diesel or justice,

134
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:21,474
but there's a place at the Beverly
center I think we could hit.

135
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:24,398
- Did you have any luck here?
- No. She's tried on everything twice.

136
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:27,166
I read every magazine in the store.
Apparently,

137
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:30,730
the kids from "High School Musical"
are having a great time in Hawaii.

138
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:34,106
And, according to the quiz,
I'm a below-average flirt.

139
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:37,637
- Try these. My niece loved them.
- OK, here's the thing.

140
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,827
My daughter just tried these on,
like, 5 minutes ago.

141
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,127
Where did you find those?
So cute!

142
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,339
How do you do this shopping?

143
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,883
It's the most boring thing
I've ever been a part of in my life.

144
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,883
OK, let me ask you something.

145
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,349
What is the longest amount of time
you've ever spent in home depot?

146
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,925
Home depot?
My world record is 4 hours, 22 min.

147
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,010
They were having a sale on skill saws.
One was...

148
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:00,675
- And I'm bored.
- What?

149
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:03,477
You can't be bored. I'm talking
about tools! Tools are awesome.

150
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:07,544
So is that feeling you get when
you've picked out the perfect outfit.

151
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,875
And you know the minute
you walk through the door,

152
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,481
the person you bought it for
is gonna turn their head and go, "wow."

153
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,897
- So, what do you think?
- Sweetie, I don't know.

154
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,826
I'm a terrible judge,
'cause you make everything look better.

155
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:24,085
What do you think?

156
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:26,912
I love it. Add a matching headband,
and you're good to go.

157
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:27,882
Can I get it?

158
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:31,470
- You can get it. Whatever you want.
- Thank you! I'm going to wear it out.

159
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:34,375
Thanks for helping me out.
You're a lifesaver, OK?

160
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,264
It's no problem.
It's actually kind of fun.

161
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:37,516
You ready?

162
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:40,491
I can't go home.
I still have to get shoes.

163
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,934
Who needs shoes? We're...

164
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:44,230
All right, we need shoes.
Can you help me with the shoes?

165
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:46,366
I know just the place. Listen, you guys

166
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,451
pay for the clothes
and then we'll head over there.

167
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:51,890
You're a lifesaver. And I will return
the favor. If you ever need a tool,

168
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,668
i'm... I'm your guy.

169
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:01,993
There's nothing sexier than a daddy
taking care of his little girl.

170
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,329
It's hot, right?

171
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:06,001
I've had this flushed feeling all day.

172
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,464
I thought it was the chinese food.

173
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:13,419
Hey, if you hadn't walked in, I would
have had him on a pile of warm pretzels.

174
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,680
Wait. What?

175
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:24,619
I am killing your secondary!

176
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,458
It's not fair. You've been
practicing while I'm at school.

177
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,434
Hey, life's full of choices, Tom.

178
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,400
OK. I'm getting picked
up in a few minutes.

179
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:36,645
- How do I look?
- You look adorable!

180
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:40,428
Dad, this is important.
I need an honest opinion.

181
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,804
Tom, how do I look?

182
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,761
Like every other girl at school.

183
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:46,377
Really? Thank you!

184
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:50,116
I hear your mom's
anti-fun bus pulling up.

185
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,635
Girl, you gotta get out of here.
You're dressed all fancy.

186
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:56,418
Look. You go up there,
and I'll stall your mother, somehow.

187
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:59,172
It might involve a tongue kiss.
I might ask you to close your eyes. OK?

188
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:03,893
When are those guys gonna finish?

189
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:07,537
I just want to go up to the guy holding
the "slow" sign and say, "we know!"

190
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,947
Wait. Why is tom playing video games?

191
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,220
You know grounded means no video games.

192
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:18,291
Yeah, well, I knew, but dad didn't.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.

193
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,034
All right. All right. Look,

194
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:24,118
I've got Louise's geometry
book for her study date tonight.

195
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,869
Good.
I'll tell her you brought it by.

196
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:29,633
Where is she?
I want to say good-bye before I leave.

197
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,183
She's sleeping, Allison.
She was solving for "X" for, like,

198
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,228
3 hours, and then her giant,
brain-filled head just keeled over.

199
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,116
She passed out. She's snoring.

200
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,495
- Look, you're acting very strangely...
- Look, I... All right. Now, Tom!

201
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,649
My God! Gary!

202
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:51,482
That was disgusting!

203
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:55,245
It was like having a warm
scallop in my mouth.

204
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,490
Is it over?

205
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,028
We're good. Let's go.

206
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,687
All right, this has been a good show.
We've established that horse racing

207
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:08,493
is the same as Nascar
but slower and with poop.

208
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,762
I'm Gary Brooks, and that's the score.

209
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,648
Dude, that is not cool. We are 5 min
over, and you know I like to leave

210
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,186
- right at 6:00 on fridays.
- Why would I know that?

211
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,784
Have you ever seen me here on a friday,
say around 6:15?

212
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:23,892
Because on fridays, I leave at 6:00,
except for today, when I'm gonna leave

213
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,314
cause I'm talking to you about
the very thing I should be doing

214
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:28,111
which is leaving. See my quandary?

215
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:32,313
Curtis, why don't we finish
this argument over a drink?

216
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:35,140
TGIF... taste guinness.
It's friday.

217
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:38,112
I just made that up, man. Come on.

218
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:39,961
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
It's Curtis time.

219
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:42,051
I just made up a jingle.
You're turning me down?

220
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,629
- You disappear to every friday?
- I can't respond to that.

221
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:48,036
The first rule of Curtis time is
do not talk about Curtis time.

222
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,247
- Hey, great show today, Gar...
- Hey, thanks, Sash...

223
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,421
So, how did Louise look
when she left for her party?

224
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:59,485
Like a million bucks...
Actually, like 264 bucks and 15 cents.

225
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,837
I have to say, i,

226
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,182
had a really good time hanging
out with you and your daughter today.

227
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,964
So, you know, let me know if,
you want to do something again sometime.

228
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:14,711
Yeah. Well, you know, according...
well, my calendar is kind of,

229
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:17,313
I mean, the first thing I have
open is right now.

230
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,609
You want to go out?

231
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,883
OK. Yeah. Sure.

232
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,255
- All right. It's a date.
- How about we call it a drink?

233
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:28,373
Hey, we can call it Fernando
for all I care. Let's get out of here.

234
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:33,281
That's my phone. You go get ready for
our Fernando while I get this, OK?

235
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:35,938
It's my daughter Louise.

236
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,953
Hi, honey!
You having a good time?

237
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,944
Dad, these girls are so mean.
They're making fun of me.

238
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:43,578
I want to go home.
Will you come pick me up, daddy?

239
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,857
Maybe you could just, like, stick it out
for little while. You know what I mean?

240
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,402
- I'll just call mom.
- No. Don't call mom.

241
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:55,622
Do me a favor. Sit tight. I'm gonna
come get you. Daddy will save the day.

242
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:58,878
Just be cool. Don't tell mom.
I'm coming. I love you.

243
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,012
You ready?

244
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:02,707
Hey, I don't know if you've heard
about this really cool Martini bar...

245
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,295
Rick's? It's on Ventura boulevard.

246
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:06,496
I actually just read
about it in "LA magazine."

247
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,786
- It's the hottest bar in the city.
- It sure is.

248
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,953
How would you like to go to
the roller rink right next-door?

249
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:14,459
I have to pick up my daughter.
Will you come with me?

250
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:16,508
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. It'll be fun.

251
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:20,403
We'll have bruises all over our bodies,
but not for the reasons I had hoped.

252
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:35,147
This won't take long, you know?
I'll grab Louise, we'll pick her up,

253
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,769
we'll drop her off, and then you
and I will go out for our drink. OK?

254
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:40,178
Dad! What. What are you doing here?

255
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:42,220
- You're totally embarrassing me.
- You called me

256
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:45,004
told me to come pick you up. You said
all the girls were making fun of you.

257
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,730
But everything's fine now.

258
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:49,773
What, so now you want to stay?

259
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:53,032
Yes, and I don't want to be the only
girl at the party with her dad here.

260
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:55,285
We're going to the arcade now.
So, don't follow us!

261
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,821
What the heck was that?

262
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,721
That's a 12-year-old girl.

263
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:05,863
I know literally what it is. What I
meant was, what the heck was that?!

264
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,392
They change their minds, Gary.

265
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,804
One minute, they like flowers
and unicorns. The next minute,

266
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:15,230
they're piercing their nipples and
winning wet t-shirt contests in Cancun.

267
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,071
3 years in a row.

268
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:20,334
Just sayin'.

269
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:22,454
Ordinarily, that would be very hot.

270
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:26,155
But considering i'm her father, that's
the most disturbing thing I can picture.

271
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,241
Except for that!

272
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,201
Oh, my gosh.

273
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,460
- What the heck are you doing?
- That's right.

274
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:41,699
This is how I spend Curtis time.

275
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:45,714
I rock the boogie.

276
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,687
Why didn't you tell me
on friday nights you rock

277
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,929
the boogie by coming
to the roller-skating rink?

278
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,579
I would have lent you my satin
windbreaker and matching dolphin shorts.

279
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,271
If you'll excuse me, I got some moves
I gotta work out before "couples skate."

280
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,379
So...

281
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:05,070
So, should we go?

282
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,781
No, I can't leave.
What if she changes her mind again?

283
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:09,983
You know, one second,
she's asking me to help her.

284
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,618
The next second, she wants to stay.

285
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,041
The party's gonna end in a half-hour,
anyway. We'll hang out.

286
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:16,966
I'll take her home. I'm sorry.
I know this is probably a drag for you.

287
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,628
No. Are you kidding me?

288
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:22,448
The fact that you care so much about her
just raised you up about

289
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,005
50 notches in my book.

290
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:25,995
50 notches?

291
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:30,386
So, listen. If you want some company,
I would be happy to stay.

292
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,028
What size are you?

293
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,035
I never had any complaints.

294
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,105
I am talking about your feet.

295
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,465
If we're gonna stay,
we may as well skate.

296
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,860
Yeah. I'm an 11.
We'll get skates.

297
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:49,122
But I should warn you, back in the day,
I was quite the wheel man.

298
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,818
I used to rock the boogie, too.

299
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,485
Gary, get your leg up here.

300
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:57,736
- I'm trying, but I'm doing the splits!
- I got you. I'm pulling.

301
00:15:57,896 --> 00:15:59,206
Pull up on my boobs!

302
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,782
- There you go! There you go!
- We're good.

303
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:07,737
I found your "i'm with stupid" t-shirt.

304
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,146
Ironically, it wasn't with you.

305
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:14,571
My... toe!

306
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:17,869
Well, well.

307
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,659
What happened to, and I quote,

308
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,818
"that language
is only suitable for sailors,

309
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,274
criminals, and that tramp
from'sex in the city'"?

310
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:30,244
Look.
There are some rare occasions

311
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:34,130
under very specific circumstances
usually involving severe

312
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,851
and sudden pain
when it's OK to use that word.

313
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,354
And you were just
here that one time I used it.

314
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:42,080
OK, what about that time
you bit your tongue at burgeroos?

315
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:43,667
OK, twice.

316
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:46,414
And that time that cop pulled you over?

317
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,123
Fine, Tom. So, what, you can remember
every time I've sworn, but you can't

318
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:53,378
remember to clear your browser history
before your mom goes online?

319
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:58,736
And by the way...
if they have a cesarean scar, I mean,

320
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,830
I don't know where they get off
calling themselves "barely legal."

321
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:05,305
But it's all right, Tom.

322
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:08,747
You're not grounded for that,
but you should be. It's disgusting.

323
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,567
Anyway, where's Louise?
I gotta give her her backpack.

324
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:15,094
I think dad went to go pick
her up at the skating rink.

325
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:18,077
She called and she was crying.
All those kids were making fun of her.

326
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,613
There was something else, too,

327
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,805
I was supposed to tell you.
It was really urgent.

328
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,093
Not to tell you.

329
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,928
Well, thank you, Tom. I'm gonna go to
my car before I say that word again.

330
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:31,382
Hey, am I still grounded?

331
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:32,494
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,463
- You just bought yourself another day.
- What?! Yeah.

333
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,964
OK. Come on.
You can do it.

334
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:47,940
You are definitely...

335
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:53,072
Improving.
Just a little... You got it.

336
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:55,906
That was a good 5 inches
further than last time.

337
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:59,230
You're a good sport. I'm glad you're
hanging out. I asked you for a drink

338
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,477
you didn't think it was gonna come from
a snack bar and turn your tongue blue.

339
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:06,431
Hey, I'm just gonna tell people
I had a wild night with papa smurf.

340
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,428
- I had a really fun day.
- I'm having a great time, too.

341
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,322
Fun time over.
Get me out of here.

342
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:15,648
Gotta go.
I'm not having fun anymore.

343
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:18,279
- What is going on? What is going on?
- No, Allison. What?

344
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:20,624
They're gonna set up
for the "hokey-pokey," and there's

345
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,100
- gonna be a "couples' skate."
- You know what? That's not funny.

346
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,519
- Hey, girl! What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

347
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:27,549
That is very funny.

348
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,411
Look. Gary, seriously,

349
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:33,689
where is Louise?
And, I mean, Tom said she was crying.

350
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,274
And why is she even at this party?

351
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,483
She knew you would disapprove
and you'd completely overreact about it.

352
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:39,970
Gary, when we got divorced,

353
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,780
we agreed to tell each other
everything then it came to the kids.

354
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,958
I'm sorry. Sasha, could you...
Can you give us a second?

355
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,675
It's kind of personal.

356
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:48,954
- OK.
- No. Let's...

357
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,146
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna
go join Curtis' congo line.

358
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,715
OK. Yeah.
All right.

359
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:56,281
- No, she can't leave.
- For god's sakes, Gary!

360
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,073
- There you go.
- Here we go.

361
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:00,359
I'm up! I'm up!
Leave me alone. I'm up.

362
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:04,024
Peer pressure is a big deal at her age?

363
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,312
And at some point,
I'm gonna have to talk to her about it.

364
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,621
OK, but not tonight, OK? She's having
a good time. She's 12 years old.

365
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:12,179
You know, one week,
she's gonna be the popular girl.

366
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:15,933
Another week, she's gonna be the rebel.
she's never going to Cancun, OK?

367
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:19,036
All right.
Gary, I am just concerned.

368
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,508
- I don't want her getting hurt.
- I'm concerned too. Believe me.

369
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:24,627
But you can't go out there
and ruin her good time... not tonight.

370
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:28,704
Please. Just this one time, Allison, let
me and Louise have this one secret. OK?

371
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:32,496
All right. But you and I are not
done talking about this.

372
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:35,330
Great, 'cause I wasn't
done pretending to listen.

373
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,439
- Well, have fun.
- All right.

374
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:41,089
Wait. Don't push me.
Don't... I'll give you a little, god.

375
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:43,503
Where are we going?

376
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,802
Sorry this night turned
out the way it did.

377
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,665
I was really looking forward to hangin
out with you outside of work.

378
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:55,101
Though, I had some time to think
when I was sitting off in the corner...

379
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:58,313
Where Allison told me to go...
And...

380
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:03,155
I realized there's just...
your life is a lot more

381
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:05,317
than just picking up cute
outfits for your daughter.

382
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:07,929
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Today was great.

383
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:11,037
You know, spending time with
you and Louise... I loved it.

384
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:14,531
But, then you and Allison
got into it, and...

385
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:17,249
There's just a whole lot more going on.

386
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:20,301
So, I guess our drink... I mean,
our date... our Fernando...

387
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:23,554
Our Fernando was a bust.

388
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:25,464
The night's not over.

389
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:28,884
And it is "couples' skate."

390
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:31,715
All right, well, I'm game if
you're game. Are you serious?

391
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:34,834
- Yeah. We can try my new idea.
- You gonna be careful? Steady.

392
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,316
- OK. So...
- All right. It...

393
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,745
I gotta be honest with you.
It still feels pretty weird.

394
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:41,045
It's gonna take some getting
used to but it'll get easier.

395
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:43,166
Feels like the ground's moving, Sasha.

396
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,003
All right.

397
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,218
Gentle.
All right.

398
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,931
Yeah, I'm all right.

399
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:55,704
