1
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:05,494
- Hey, Louise. How was your day?
- Terrible.

2
00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:07,681
Remember when I wrote
that letter to the epa

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:09,970
about toxic insulation in our school?

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:13,807
Yeah, honey, you write a lot of letters.

5
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:17,958
Well, it's gonna cost
the school $50,000 to fix it,

6
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:20,509
so they're canceling the art program.

7
00:00:21,602 --> 00:00:23,272
- How was your day, Tommy?
- Great.

8
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:25,711
I just found out I don't have
to take art, so...

9
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,517
- No, thanks. I got it.
- What's that?

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,943
Just one of many boxes of yours
that's still stacked in my basement.

11
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:41,490
Come on. It's time you got the rest
of your stuff out of my house. I mean,

12
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:44,353
the ski clothes, the stereo equipment,
the comic books,

13
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:47,078
all 6 stupid seasons
of "Perfect Strangers."

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,394
Larry and Balki.
They were ill-suited to be roommates.

15
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:54,257
That's not stupid, that's genius.

16
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,839
Gary, it's time, OK?
I want it out by friday.

17
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:02,131
Friday?
Don't be ridiculous!

18
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:07,047
Gary, it was supposed to be out months
ago, OK? Nowhere in the divorce

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,615
- agreement does it.
- Oh, my gosh! The divorce agreement!

20
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,240
The piece of paper that stipulates
that you always get the upper hand

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,986
- and I get the finger.
- OK, you know what?

22
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:18,111
It is not my fault
that your lawyer's band

23
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,245
went on tour during our proceedings.

24
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:25,605
If Hasselhoff says you're going on ur,

25
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:27,107
You're going on tour.

29
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,738
Look at all this cool stuff you have
in mom's basement. What's this?

30
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:41,546
That's a beer-can hat, my friend,

31
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,259
and I'll have you know
I drank all those beers myself.

32
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:47,295
- That's only 3, dad.
- You know what?

33
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:50,137
You try crocheting a hat
after drinking 3 beers.

34
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,151
Tommy, not until you're 17!

35
00:01:57,773 --> 00:01:59,718
Is this your eighth-grade yearbook, dad?

36
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:01,763
Yeah.
Let me show you something.

37
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:03,068
See...

38
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:06,571
look at this. See this tall, handsome
guy playing quarterback?

39
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:07,629
Is that you?

40
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:10,519
No, I just always thought
that guy was tall and handsome.

41
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,829
No, I didn't play football
until high school.

42
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,119
This is junior high, where I wrestled.

43
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:18,151
There. There's your daddy
wrestling right there.

44
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,469
Your face is being covered
by that guy's butt.

45
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,743
Actually...

46
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:24,079
that's my butt.
I quit after that.

47
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:28,071
Yeah, once you see your
own butt from that angle,

48
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,832
you know it's time to quit.

49
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:35,620
Thanks for getting
all this stuff out of here.

50
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,139
Yeah, just a few more
loads and all evidence

51
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:41,114
of my existence in the basement
I spent hundreds of hours

52
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:43,522
and thousands of dollars
finishing will be complete.

53
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:45,413
And many a nights passed out in.

54
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,634
I wasn't passed out,
Allison, I was hiding.

55
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:50,524
It's not really hiding if no
one's looking for you, Gary.

56
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,196
Look, I'll be back next week
to get the pool table, OK?

57
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:55,301
The pool table?

58
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:58,763
Yeah, the pool table. You probably
know it as my basement wife.

59
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,355
- Gary, the pool table is mine.
- What?

60
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,691
Yeah. I believe you gave it to me
as an anniversary gift one year?

61
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,061
No, no.
That was a joke.

62
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,553
No, that's a joke. I gave it to you,
but it's really for me.

63
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,397
- You know, it's a joke.
- No Gary.

64
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:16,299
That's the set-up to the joke.
The punch line is "i'm keeping it."

65
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:19,805
No, no! Allison, no!
This is my pool table!

66
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:23,600
You can't have it. She's perfect.
I love her.

67
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,115
You don't even use it.

68
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,658
What do you mean? I'm using it right now
to store old photographs,

69
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:29,843
none of which, by the way,
is of a trip to Paris,

70
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:32,594
which is what you should have got me
as an anniversary gift.

71
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:36,121
France, Allison? Really? You want to sit
on a plane for 11 hours to find out

72
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,161
people don't like you there, either?

73
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:44,477
- Come on, let me keep the pool table.
- What? No, no. This was a gift to me.

74
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:47,511
The divorce agreement clearly states
all gifts stay with the recipient.

75
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,576
You know, I wish you would stop bringing
up that stupid divorce agreement

76
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,484
- because I signed it under duress.
- How were you under duress?

77
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,539
They said if I didn't sign it,
i'd have to stay married to you!

78
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,733
I'm sorry about your pool table, honey.
Why is Allison being so stubborn?

79
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,523
I don't know. Why do bees sting people
even though they know they're gonna die?

80
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:10,395
She doesn't deserve that table.
She doesn't respect the game. She calls

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,623
the rack "that triangle thing."

82
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,202
What's a rack?

83
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,264
It's the... you know,
it's that triangle thing.

84
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,023
I can't believe she's got the upper hand

85
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,087
in everything regarding
our divorce agreement.

86
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:27,322
One day I got to read that
stupid piece of paper I signed.

87
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,727
Well, I think that she's
being totally unfair.

88
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,775
- Want to switch places?
- Yeah, sure.

89
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,724
So how'd things go today with your ex?

90
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,793
Oh, god, we fought,
as usual.

91
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:42,445
This time it was about our dog wendell.

92
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:45,391
He needs pills that cost $50 a month,
and Ronnie refuses

93
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,557
- to split the bill with me.
- Cheap bastard.

94
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,754
Thank you.

95
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:51,430
- I didn't know you had a dog.
- Yeah.

96
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:53,176
I'm kind of a dog lover.

97
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:56,129
I don't even know how many I've
rescued. I can't even count.

98
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:58,245
But when we split,
I couldn't find a place

99
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,602
that would let me keep them,
so Ronnie has them all.

100
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:01,540
All?

101
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,829
What do you mean by all?
How many dogs do you have?

102
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,406
7?

103
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,221
Tucker, Daisy, Wendell,

104
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,748
Arizona, Cheater, Cabot, and Gus.

105
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:17,264
But they're all really small.
Except for gus, who's, like, huge.

106
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,456
So Ronnie takes care of your 7 dogs?

107
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,318
Yeah, but it's not that hard,

108
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,622
except for Cabot, who needs eye drops.
And tucker, who needs anti-depressants.

109
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,737
Yeah, and, of course,
gus the bus, who

110
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:31,926
has to sleep in bed
with you human-style

111
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:34,025
Head on pillow.
It's really cute.

112
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,398
But Ronnie acts, like,
so put out by the whole thing.

113
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,259
He's such a Jerk!

114
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,680
I said he's such a Jerk.

115
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,779
Right, Gary?
Isn't he a Jerk?

116
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:51,854
Oh, my god!
Are you siding with Ronnie?

117
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:54,583
No, I'm not siding
with Ronnie, but 7 dogs?

118
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:58,628
Eye drops, anti-depressants,
gus the bus? Oh, my gosh!

119
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,759
It sounds like Ronnie kind of got the
not-so-good end of the deal there right?

120
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,692
What are you like,
Ronnie's best friend now?

121
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:07,704
- No, I'm not Ronnie's best friend...
- Why don't you go off and marry him?

122
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,188
Doesn't sound like he has room for me.

123
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,055
You know what?
I got to go to work.

124
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,788
Come on. I was just kidding around,
that's all. Come on.

125
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,640
You know, I totally supported
you with your pool-table issue.

126
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,519
And I support you, too. I just
thought it was funny with the 7 dogs.

127
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:23,290
I was trying to make a joke, that's all.

128
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:26,603
You know what? I hope that you
and Ronnie will be very happy together,

129
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:29,208
but the first time he calls
and says he's spending the night at his

130
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,727
"brother's," he's at his
really banging a waitress.

131
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:40,925
- How was your power walk?
- Exhilarating. What a workout.

132
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:45,360
- What happened to your hand weights?
- Stolen by skateboarders.

133
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:48,224
One on each side.
They picked me clean.

134
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,943
Well, this will cheer you up.
It's a picture of me in Cancun.

135
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,709
Spring break, my senior year of college.

136
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:56,742
Gee!

137
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,005
You must have been
caught in a Rainstorm.

138
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,632
Your t-shirt is soaked.

139
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:05,480
Yeah. I won $200 for getting
caught in that Rainstorm.

140
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:09,470
You could have won additional money
by entering some sort of breast contest.

141
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,842
- Thank you, honey.
- What are you doing?

142
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,543
Well, now that Gary finally got
all his stuff out of the way,

143
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,201
I can start organizing my things,
starting with all my pictures.

144
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:23,588
Why is Gary lying on his back in
front of the Washington monument?

145
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:27,229
See?

146
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:31,312
I get it.
It's as though it's his penis.

147
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:36,093
Yeah, he has a whole series
of those things: the space needle,

148
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,134
Giant Redwood, old faithful.

149
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,959
He has embarrassed me from
sea to fricking shing sea.

150
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,166
Well, I wouldn't give im the Cancun
photo. That would just be cruel.

151
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:48,463
No, he's not getting
that one, but believe me,

152
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,307
Gary's seen pictures
of me wearing a lot less, a lot less.

153
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:55,196
Actually, there's a photo
album around here somewhere.

154
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,564
Where is it?

155
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:01,285
- What are you looking for?
- It's a...

156
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:03,652
It's a purple satin photo album.

157
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,212
- Crap. I don't think it's here.
- What's in it?

158
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:10,683
Our first valentine's day,
I gave Gary some... Pictures of me.

159
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,428
Tasteful boudoir photos?

160
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,569
Yes...

161
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,755
And no.

162
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,814
Let's each take a box. We'll
treat this area like a grid.

163
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,934
OK.

164
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,050
Oh, god. It's not here.

165
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:28,177
You can give up if
you like, but I intend

166
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:30,441
to find those photos and look at them.

167
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,844
Easy, easy, easy!

168
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,998
Hey, dennis, I just
measured the entire garage.

169
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,887
We can totally put
the pool table in there.

170
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:43,072
We just have to play
with the garage door open

171
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:46,071
and switch to drumsticks when we're
up against the water heater, OK?

172
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:50,878
Dude, OK, but Allison's never
changed her mind about anything,

173
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:53,853
except for spending the
rest of her life with you.

174
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,614
It's a good point, Dennis.

175
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,442
You need to concentrate on all
the great things that you did get:

176
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:00,831
Comic books...

177
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:02,999
Frank Sinatra plate...

178
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:06,756
Photo album with sex
picture of Allison on it.

179
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:08,519
What did you say?

180
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,447
Sinatra plate.

181
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:13,475
The other thing. Go back.
What was the other one? What's that?

182
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,496
Here. This is for you.
You can have the Sinatra plate.

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,357
Oh, my gosh!

184
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,723
I thought this was long gone,
but it's not. Here it is in my hands!

185
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,621
What's in it?

186
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,593
They're just photos
of a personal nature.

187
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,293
May I please see her personal nature?

188
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,676
Come on, man. It's just
a bunch of old pictures.

189
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:33,627
No, you're not getting it. It's
much more than that, OK, Dennis?

190
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:37,359
Chalk up your drumstick, my friend,
because this is a pool table!

191
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,656
May I come in?

192
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:53,503
You know, except for the smile
and the nice disposition,

193
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,264
you look a lot like my ex-wife.

194
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:02,026
That is so funny because
you and I are often fighting!

195
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,027
- What do you want?
- What?

196
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:09,991
- What? What do you want?
- What? Nothing. I just, came over

197
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:11,774
to see, you know, if you needed any help

198
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:14,272
unpacking, organizing, whatnot.

199
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:16,754
You're looking for something.
Are you looking for anything?

200
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:20,771
No, Gary. I just know how hard
it is to settle into a new home, so...

201
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:24,328
'Cause I was looking through the boxes
earlier, and I found something

202
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:26,499
fascinating that you might
be interested in.

203
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:31,958
- A photo album.
- Really?

204
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,723
Of Tommy when he was a baby.

205
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,747
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

206
00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:44,577
I did find something that
gave me hours of pleasure

207
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:48,430
Allison that you might be interested in,
and that, of course, would be bare...

208
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,896
Naked ladies, their second Cd.

209
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:57,420
Sure you're not looking for anything?

210
00:10:57,544 --> 00:10:59,768
Please, Gary. You always
say I got all the good stuff.

211
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:02,840
- What could I possibly be looking for?
- I don't know...

212
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:04,708
Letters, journals,

213
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:08,430
11 saucy photos of a filthy bride,

214
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,057
circa 1993?

215
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,535
So you found the valentine's day photos.

216
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,871
Yes, I did.

217
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,060
- May I have them?
- No, you may not.

218
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:23,720
You know, the divorce agreement
clearly states that all gifts

219
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,850
are the property of the recipient.

220
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,598
Photos are exempt from the rule, Gary!

221
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,213
They're not exempt.
They may be illegal in a few states,

222
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:34,196
but they're not exempt, Allison.

223
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,448
- Give me the photos!
- No, no. Hey, I have an idea:

224
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,062
- Yeah?
- Is it lonely?

225
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:42,510
What an unfortunate time to mock me,
because I was thinking I could trade

226
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,006
a few naughty Allison pictures

227
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,250
for some things that I would like
to have around here.

228
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,794
No, Gary. Absolutely not.
I refuse to deal on principle.

229
00:11:48,914 --> 00:11:52,256
But you're not that principled, Allison.
In fact I have the pictures to prove it.

230
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:55,968
That was close.

231
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,691
That's close.
Swing and a miss!

232
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,253
Strike 3. You're out.

233
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,185
All right.
All right, so,

234
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:06,698
you're trying to Blackmail me
into giving you the pool table.

235
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:07,979
For starters.

236
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:10,715
- Starters?
- Have a seat.

237
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,954
We'll talk all about it.
Go on. Sit, sit.

238
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:17,595
You know, Allison, for the first time
in our 15 years together, I

239
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:20,384
have the upper hand.
And, you know, it's amazing

240
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,127
that you would take hat book out
of my hand, tank you very much.

241
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,660
There's some things I've always wanted
since we've been divorced,

242
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,083
and now I have the power to ask
for them. For example, I...

243
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,054
want the armoire.

244
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:39,277
My grandmother's armoire
that's been holding my clothes

245
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:40,825
since I was a little girl?

246
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:43,654
That's what an armoire is?

247
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,762
No, I-- I don't want that. Um...

248
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,390
What's the leather thing I put
my feet onwhen I'm watching football?

249
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,033
- That's an ottoman.
- I want the ottoman.

250
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,254
Now let's talk music.
Let's talk crows:

251
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:02,615
I get counting and black,
you keep Sheryl.

252
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,969
You mean, no?
I don't even want that stuff anyway.

253
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,291
All I really care about is the pool
table. I want it back.

254
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:11,090
No. I'm saying no to everything.

255
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,472
OK, great. Well,
I guess I can do whatever I want with

256
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:15,983
pouty Allison...

257
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,676
Allison in the jacuzzi.

258
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,184
I like this picture the most
'cause you look genuinely surprised

259
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,314
that you're not wearing any pants.

260
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:32,856
- Where are the pictures?
- How dumb do you think I am?

261
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:35,526
Very, but stay on the subject.
Where are they?

262
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:39,106
They're hidden, Allison.
I hid them in a place where

263
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:41,073
you will never find them, ever.

264
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,402
All right.
All right, Gary.

265
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,990
I give up. You win.

266
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:50,713
Bring the photos over and,
i'll give you the pool table.

267
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:52,664
That sounds good.

268
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,254
And... I'm sorry it had
to get so dirty, Allison,

269
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,047
but you left me no choice.

270
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:01,230
And I'm sorry, but when I was pulling in
I Kinda clipped the side of your van.

271
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,065
No, you didn't!

272
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,058
What are you doing?

273
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,791
Going to get my pictures
in your sock drawer.

274
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,345
What makes you think I would
hide them in my sock drawer?

275
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,618
Come on, Allison!

276
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:28,912
Flick.

277
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:43,344
- How much for you, sweet cheeks?
- Ira?

278
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:46,646
No, it's me! It's Gary!

279
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,810
I know.
Are you still in love with Ronnie?

280
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,645
No, I hate Ronnie. Ronnie stinks.

281
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:52,895
It's OK, Ira. He's all right.

282
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,734
Oh, my gosh. That's got
to be the toughest ira in America.

283
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:02,265
Look, I'm sorry I overreacted
about the whole Ronnie thing.

284
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:04,859
I was just so crazed
about this thing with Allison

285
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,765
and the pool table.
I apologize.

286
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,149
- So you never side with Ronnie again?
- Never.

287
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:11,367
Even if you think that
he's right and I'm wrong?

288
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:12,593
Even that, yes.

289
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:14,875
And you don't think I'm crazy
for having 7 dogs?

290
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,255
No.
I think it's cute.

291
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:22,091
Come on. I am so crazy.
I have 7 dogs! Who has 7 dogs?

292
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:25,935
My hot girlfriend's ex-husband,
who's a Jerk.

293
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,269
You just earned yourself a beer, mister.

294
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,209
All right. Let's have a toast.
To exes who stink.

295
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:37,430
I take it you didn't
get back your pool table.

296
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:41,482
I had it, Vanessa.
I had the pool table in my hands,

297
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:44,309
and then Allison just took it right out
of my sock drawer.

298
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:48,903
I'm gonna pretend I know what that
means. You can play pool here.

299
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:52,685
I know, but it's not the Same.
I need that pool table specifically.

300
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:56,625
I got to get that table out of Allison's
basement, but I don't know how.

301
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:01,437
What time does Ira get off of work?

302
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,424
Come on, you guys. Let's go.

303
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:12,222
All right. We got to make this quick
before Allison gets home, all right?

304
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,103
We're not doing anything
illegal, are we?

305
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:17,104
No. This is my ex-wife's house, Ira.
We're not car, car!

306
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,463
Car! Car! Car!

307
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:24,375
No, we're OK. It's gone now. Come on.
Everybody up. We're all right.

308
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,896
- I'm hungry.
- What?

309
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:30,393
Yeah, we'll get something to eat when
we're finished like we talked about,

310
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,184
- OK, Ira?
- But I'm hungry now.

311
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:36,301
All right, Ira.
Let's see what we have here.

312
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,269
- Hey, hey, look. Lasagna.
- I'm on the south beach diet.

313
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,988
Ira, we're kind of in a time
crunch here. Could you help me out?

314
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:48,834
OK, heat it up.
I'll eat around the noodles.

315
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,174
Oh, my god! This is ridiculous!

316
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,591
Ira, you want to help us out
down here or what?

317
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,898
You actually divorced a woman
who can cook lasagna like this?

318
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,501
You are a foolish, foolish man.

319
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:06,453
Hey, guys, can we move this along?
My wife's asleep,

320
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:09,775
and if she rolls over and doesn't
squish me, she'll know I'm not there.

321
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,926
OK, let's get started.
We're gonna have to take the pool

322
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:16,243
cue rack off the walls,
so we're gonna need a screwdriver...

323
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,922
or...

324
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:22,387
or some spackle.
That's cool. Either way.

325
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,760
All right, come on.
Help me get this tarp off.

326
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,799
All right. Come on, Dennis 1, 2, 3.

327
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,160
Put it back! Put it back!

328
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:32,273
- Put it back!
- I knew it!

329
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,360
I knew you were gonna try
to steal the pool table.

330
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,499
What? Steal the pool table?
Gary Lied.

331
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,007
He said we were gonna
try to save Christmas!

332
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,302
Are we trespassing?

333
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,404
Long were you laying under there?

334
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,572
Long enough to know you're
the worst criminal ever.

335
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,633
I'm not a criminal!
I came to take what was mine!

336
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:53,867
My god! You are never
gonna let this go, are you?

337
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:56,461
No. Why should i? You got
everything in the divorce!

338
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:58,624
I got totally shafted!
You got the money!

339
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,271
You got the cars! You got
my bar, for crying out loud!

340
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:03,906
I am so sick and tired
of hearing about everything you lost!

341
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,760
What about me, Gary? You think
this was my childhood dream?

342
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:10,507
To be divorced after 15 years,
and arguing through lawyers,

343
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:12,394
shuttling our kids back and forth?

344
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,941
You're not the only one
that lost something, Gary.

345
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:18,064
You want a pool table so bad,
go out and buy one.

346
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,870
I don't want to go out and buy one.
I want this one, Allison.

347
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,582
Why does it have to be this one?

348
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,390
Because this one's mine! I had so
many good memories with this one!

349
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,062
Yeah? That's why I want it, too!

350
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:29,084
What, we want this for the same reason?

351
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:31,273
Well, then that is completely weird.

352
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:34,658
Gary, I love this table.

353
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:38,789
What, you think I'm just trying to
hold on to it just to be vindictive?

354
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:41,029
It would fit a pattern, yeah.

355
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,678
We had so much fun down here.

356
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,132
The kids would play,
and we would have all the neighbors

357
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,796
come over and remember,
I'd bring drinks downstairs

358
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,344
for everybody and you'd yell at me
when I put the can on the wood?

359
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:54,857
Yeah, it leaves a ring.

360
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,817
I mean, it's...

361
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,593
the one part of us
I wouldn't mind holding on to.

362
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:04,711
But, you know, if you're not gonna
let it go and you're gonna

363
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,861
feel like you've been so shafted, then
just, you know, go ahead and take it.

364
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,645
I can't take it after your nice speech.
I'd be a complete tool if I took it now.

365
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,145
Plus Ira's gone.

366
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:17,376
No, he's still up there. I can
hear him digging through my freezer.

367
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,187
Ira: mind if I have the last dove bar?

368
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:25,715
You said you were on
the south beach diet!

369
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:27,845
If you want it,
just say you want it.

370
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,412
You keep the table, OK?

371
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:34,080
It's worth it to me to know
that you have something in your house

372
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,136
that reminds you of me in a good way.

373
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,060
You know, Gary, I don't know
if I ever said this, but I'm sorry...

374
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,836
It didn't work out for us.

375
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:48,294
But, you know, we started
in a good place.

376
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:50,155
We started in a great place.

377
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:53,437
- Game of 8-ball?
- I'd like that.

378
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,258
- Winner gets the ottoman?
- Rack'em.

379
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,641
I don't have to.
They're already in the triangle thing.

380
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:06,121
Did everybody have hair like that
back in the eighties?

381
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,730
We looked awesome.

382
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,272
Was it really windy back then?

383
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:15,831
No, sweetie. See, even the guys
back then, we would use a blow dryer.

384
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,159
Also, we used this stuff called mousse.

385
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,747
It was kind of like mayonnaise
that your hair ate.

386
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:26,607
Well, there's no kind way to say this,
but everyone looked kind of stupid.

387
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,447
Are you out of your mind?
We look fantastic.

388
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,685
Look at all the different
looks you have here. You have

389
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,830
your Boy George. Look at this.
Your crockett and your tubbs.

390
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,545
Look, you got the Madonna look,
the flock of Seagulls. Come on, man.

391
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,373
We looked good.

392
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:48,667
- Why do you do that?
- Do what? What'd I do?

393
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:51,997
- You put your collar up.
- I don't know. I think it looks cool.

394
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,719
- Tommy, where you going?
- I'm gonna go burn my yearbook.

395
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,744
