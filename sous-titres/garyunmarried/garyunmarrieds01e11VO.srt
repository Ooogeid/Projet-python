00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:05,630
Hey, guys.
Bills, all Bills.

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:09,764
Bills, Bil... a subscription form
for "High Times" magazine?

3
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,831
You've been here 2 days, dad.
How did they find you?

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,770
It's a cosmic thing.

5
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:20,749
Did my dad tell ya I put
him on one of my work crews?

6
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:22,284
Yeah, I think that's great.

7
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,166
I'm just gonna do it until I get
enough bread to get my van fixed.

8
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:26,881
What do you have to do to your van?

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,517
Just the usual maintenance, you know?
Rewire the black light,

10
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:34,257
update the mural,
shampoo the carpet on the ceiling.

11
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:38,020
I don't want to sound like a gear head,
dad, but maybe you can get a van

12
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:40,402
where all 4 tires are the same size.

13
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:46,197
Hey, look at this. Report card time.
The Brooks kids. Let's see how they did.

14
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:50,338
Louise Brooks, straight as.
That's my girl.

15
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,550
Until a blood test proves otherwise.

16
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:56,991
Check that out.
Tommy brooks. A. B+. A.

17
00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:00,033
C-.
C- in PE?

18
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:02,615
How do you get a C- in gym class?

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,145
You wear your church
shoes on the wood floor?

20
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,651
Did you,
check his backpack for drugs?

21
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,694
Tommy doesn't have drugs in
his back pack, all right, dad?

22
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,807
Where do you suppose he would keep them?

23
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,150
I don't understand this.
Tommy, Tommy's my son.

24
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:24,249
He's a Brooks.
We come from a long line of athletes.

25
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,419
Starting with my generation of course.

26
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:31,220
I played football, I wrestled, track

27
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:33,815
not to mention
I had a trial with the Dodgers.

28
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:37,137
Hey, it's 3:00. Time for Gary to mention
his tryout with the Dodgers.

29
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:40,774
There you go, all set.

30
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,730
Thanks. Feels good.
How's it look?

31
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:47,248
It's the way you like it. Rickles
in the front, Kenny G in the back.

32
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:55,522
- I gotta go, my friend's picking me up.
- Your friend? You seein'somebody new?

33
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,947
But don't even bother
asking her about the guy.

34
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,198
She won't give any
information whatsoever.

35
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:04,345
But, I know he's not in my ballpark,
because my ballpark is Dodgers'stadium,

36
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:06,485
where I had a tryout, incidentally.

37
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:09,435
Come on. Just tell us, where is he from?

38
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:13,047
He was born in Canada.

39
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:18,372
Look at me?
I'm Canada!

40
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:22,520
My bacon's round.
It's really ham, but we call it bacon?

41
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,356
And he was a professional athlete.

42
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:29,496
Look at me? This what I'm aboot.
I played profe, time out!

43
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,884
You're dating a professional athlete?
What sport? Gimme a hint.

44
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:36,287
He's gay?

45
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:40,250
He's a basketball player.
Good-bye, Jack.

46
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:41,577
Good-bye.

47
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:46,026
She's dating a gay
Canadian basketball player?

48
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:51,730
You know, I got no recollection
of you ever trying out for the Dodgers.

49
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:55,479
That probably because that was the year
you decided to try and find bigfoot.

50
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,660
No, that was the year the son
of a bitch made it personal.

54
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,251
Louise, honey,
do you know where the fly swatter is?

55
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:17,320
No, and mom?
A fly is a living, breathing creature.

56
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:21,025
I know. That's why I need a fly swatter.
If it was dead, i'd just need a tissue.

57
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,288
- I got it.
- Hey, Louise, you ready to go?

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,061
It's either that,
or stay here and witness a murder.

59
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,871
Louise, do you have any idea
how many flies

60
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:34,243
die on my windshield every time
I drive you to the recycling center?

61
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,386
- It's a classic Hobson's choice, dad.
- At's how we're gonna handle this?

62
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,528
I say something clever, and then you
say something I don't understand?

63
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:44,462
Why don't you go wait in the car,
smarty?

64
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:47,348
Where's Tom?

65
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:49,430
He's with Walter,
he'll be back in a min.

66
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,709
This fly is driving me crazy.
I can't get it.

67
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,361
Why don't you do what you usually do?
Stop acknowledging it,

68
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,553
don't let it touch you,
and then just chip away

69
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,270
at its soul
until it loses the will to live.

70
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,396
Hey. So,
did you see Tommy's report card?

71
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:08,232
I know, I have. I'm so proud of him
for bringing up that science grade.

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,133
Thank you for not helping
him as much this semester.

73
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,850
He did great in everything,
except gym class.

74
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,867
I mean, how do ya how do ya
get a C- in PE? I know a kid

75
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:20,025
when I was in high school that smoked
in gym class. He got a B+.

76
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:23,622
I know, it's unacceptable,
but, Frankly, I mean, Gary...

77
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:26,636
Of all of his classes,
PE.'s the least of my worries.

78
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,443
Wait. All right.

79
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,184
- Hey, guys, how was your hike?
- Fabulous.

80
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:36,372
- Wait, time out.
- You guys went on a hike?

81
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:39,395
I've been takin'Tommy on urban nature
hikes around the neighborhood lately.

82
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,972
That must be fascinating. I bet you get
up real early and if you're real quiet,

83
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,553
you can sneak up on
the elusive man who leaves

84
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:47,408
pizza coupons on door knobs.

85
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,117
Actually, it was sort of cool.
Dr. K knows all kinds of stuff.

86
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,321
Do you know that there are places
in the neighborhood

87
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:55,350
where you can find
edible plants and animals?

88
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:57,759
Yeah, they're called
restaurants and salad bars.

89
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,149
- Am I right? Right?
- I guess, but

90
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,444
you know, you can also get nutrients
from pine needles, acorns.

91
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:08,610
But good joke about the salad bar.
Yeah. Salad bar.

92
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,629
All right, don't pity me.
Go wait in the car.

93
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,028
- Thanks, Dr. K.
- I enjoyed it, too, Tom.

94
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:17,475
I should get going.
I'm having a new phone put in.

95
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:21,218
That must be exciting. Maybe they can,
let you keep your original number.

96
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:22,825
One.

97
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:28,499
Another jab at my age. Tell me, Gary,
when you enrolled in college,

98
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:31,365
what did the operator
standing by say to you?

99
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:36,534
Now I know why Tommy
is getting a C- in gym.

100
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,695
- Because of Krandall.
- What are you talking about?

101
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:41,890
Think about it. When he's at my house,
he with me. 2 guys, hanging out, right?

102
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:45,792
But when he comes here, he's with
3 women, Louise, you, and Krandall.

103
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,222
Are you implying that Walter is
an inadequate male role model?

104
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,189
No, I'm implying that Walter
is an inadequate male.

105
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:58,111
Yep, well, he is enough of a man
to keep a big smile on my face.

106
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,590
OK, that's disgusting.

107
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,138
And during sex,
he never once said, "hey,

108
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:05,321
do you mind keeping this going
on your own while I go grab a beer?"

109
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:12,586
You know, in all fairness, when I came
back, you had lost interest in yourself.

110
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,627
I have carpal tunnel, you know that.

111
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:21,369
Look, whatever you think of him,
Gary, he is great with Tom.

112
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:23,723
He's great with Tom?
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:26,006
There's a 14-year old boy
roaming the neighborhoods

114
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,047
eating the weeds out of people's yards.

115
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,522
- Did you get it?
- Of course I got it.

116
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,931
Using skills I honed in gym class, OK?

117
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,311
- They taught you how to catch flies?
- No, but they taught us

118
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,092
hand-eye coordination, dexterity
and look, here's the bottom line.

119
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:44,178
When I have Tom, I put a little
more "manfluence" in his life

120
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,433
and strip away all the "kranfluence."

121
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:50,242
Give me the fly swatter. All right.
There ya go, buddy. Have at it.

122
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,642
What are you doing?

123
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:56,370
- That was fun, Tommy. How ya doin'?
- I'm beat.

124
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,095
3 hours of running and jumping
and catching frisbees?

125
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,800
Don't take this wrong, dad,
but you might need a puppy.

126
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,344
You know, we learned
a very valuable lesson today, son.

127
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:08,468
You can go to the park, you can play
football, baseball. You can shoot hoops,

128
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:11,807
play soccer. But as soon as a man and
his son start wrestling in the grass,

129
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,325
people call the cops.

130
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,437
I think we wandered into
the wrong section of the park.

131
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,357
I've got something really
manly planned for us tomorrow.

132
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:26,754
What? More manly than getting
my head squeezed in a leg scissor hold?

133
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:31,060
I told you if that happened, just scream
out for help if it was bothering you.

134
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:34,281
Yeah, I couldn't hear you, dad. Your
thighs were pressed against my ears.

135
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:38,255
Look, tomorrow. Paintball. Come on,
we're gonna do it. It'll be great.

136
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,472
It'll be me, you, grandpa,
Jack, and Dennis.

137
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:42,595
And you can bring a friend if you want,
handsome?

138
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,684
I don't know, dad.
Can we just go for a hike?

139
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,528
I mean it's, it's wildflower season.

140
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:51,265
Look, I need to talk to you
about your grades a little.

141
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,913
I mean, you did really good,
but a C- in gym, that's not cool.

142
00:07:53,996 --> 00:07:56,054
I mean, we're Brooks men.
We have a rep to protect.

143
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,908
I know, I just keep forgetting
my gym bag. It's no big deal.

144
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:02,048
Well, you know you can talk to me if
you need to talk about anything, right?

145
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,685
- Yeah, of course.
- Anything you want to talk about?

146
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,344
You sure? I mean, I can really
help you school, girls, gym class.

147
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:12,624
I'm an expert in everything,
except school and girls.

148
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,956
Dad, there is nothing
that I need to talk about, OK?

149
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,364
- I'm gonna hit the showers.
- OK, I love you.

150
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:23,181
I used to love gym when I was in school.
That was my favorite class.

151
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:27,101
It was just fun. It was just a break in
the day, where you could just run wild.

152
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:30,206
Run all you want. Shoot some hoops.
Tackle each other.

153
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:33,242
The best was talkin'smack in
the locker room, afterwards.

154
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:36,770
That was always fun, you know?
Hey, Tommy. Heads up!

155
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,738
Oh, my god!

156
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:45,073
- Tommy! Are you OK?!
- No, I'm not OK!

157
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:48,192
What the hell was that for?!
Yeah, that's right, dad, I said hell!

158
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:52,672
- Son, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.
- You didn't mean to what?

159
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,160
Deliberately roll up a towel,
wait'til I got my pants off,

160
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,952
and then crack me in the nards?!

161
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,999
- Tommy, I said "heads up."
- Yeah, and then I turned around!

162
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:04,756
But heads up doesn't mean "turn around"!
Heads up means like, Duck.

163
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:07,116
- Everyone knows that!
- Yeah? I beg to differ!

164
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,970
Paintball starts in an hour.
Where is private Tom?

165
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:17,972
Private tom is icing his privates.

166
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,924
Snapping him with a towel? Really?
I mean, what are you gonna do next?

167
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,801
Put bars of soap in a pillowcase
and beat him in his bunk?

168
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,986
All right. Look, I feel bad enough
about this without you piling on.

169
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,680
It was just a little locker horseplay,
and he turned into a heads up.

170
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,287
- That's all.
- So, you're saying this is his fault.

171
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:36,866
His testes just jumped into
the path of your towel.

172
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:40,795
Kind of, yeah. I mean, everyone knows
that heads up means you turn away.

173
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,019
You don't turn into a heads up.
It means a ball,

174
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:44,952
a puck, or a towel is coming your way.

175
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,590
I was kind of hoping we were
raising a gentleman, OK?

176
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:49,756
Not pluto, from "animal house."

177
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,074
- Bluto.
- Whatever.

178
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,783
No! That is, bluto! That's the kind
of stuff he's not learning over here!

179
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,410
Or on his nature walks
with "crocodile Krandall."

180
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:01,613
You know what, Gary? It's a good thing
Walter was here, because Tom got home.

181
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,494
He was so embarrassed, he didn't want
talk to me. Wanted to talk another man.

182
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,389
Wait. Wha... time out. My son's talking
to Krandall about this stuff?

183
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:11,438
Why isn't he talking to me?
I mean, I'm his father. I'm the man.

184
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,959
Yeah. Well, thanks to the man,
right now,

185
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:17,218
Tom is upstairs with a bag of
frozen peas on his scrotum.

186
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:22,589
Your dad's here! Bring down
that bag of peas! I'm makin'pot pie!

187
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,550
How are the fellas?

188
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,654
Hurt, angry, and a little less
trusting than they were before.

189
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,864
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, son, but

190
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:44,391
way to man up and play hurt today.

191
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,743
Did you get a friend to play with us?

192
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:55,230
- What are you doing, Krandall?
- Tom invited me to join you.

193
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,397
No. No, Tommy, I said that you should
probably bring a friend, right?

194
00:10:59,522 --> 00:11:00,836
Well, dr. K is my friend.

195
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,425
No, I meant, like, a school friend.
Like Brian, or Glenn.

196
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,375
Not a friend that needs
a chair in the shower.

197
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,340
Dad, Dr. Knows everything
about war and historic battles.

198
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:15,398
But this is paint ball.
You have a flag that you defend, and

199
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:17,424
you go and try to get
the other guy's flag.

200
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,491
You don't have to know about battles.

201
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:23,446
Hey, Dr. K, someone sounds like
the french at the battle of agincourt.

202
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:27,473
So, Tom, what do you want
for st. Crispin's day?

203
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,692
I'll tell you what I don't want.
Heavy French armor in the mud.

204
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,754
Get in the car.

205
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:41,516
All right, come on, let's go! Get'em
in here! Drag'em in here, you guys!

206
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,577
Come on, hurry up, hurry up! We've
got a few minutes while they reload,

207
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:48,275
and then they're gonna come at us
with everything they got, all right?

208
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,189
OK, we've got "boo goo" bad
guys up in the tree line!

209
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:54,424
Dad, would you stop talking like that?
You're freaking everybody out!

210
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,341
- Dennis is in bad shape, dad.
- Come on, Dennis, get up.

211
00:11:58,531 --> 00:11:59,806
I'm in pain.

212
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:02,594
Of course you are. You had
3 breakfast sandwiches at a gas station.

213
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:03,997
What do you expect?

214
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:07,309
If something bursts out of my stomach,
kill it.

215
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:10,855
What's going on with you?
You're our point man.

216
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,435
You supposed to be there shooting
guys. You haven pulled the trigger.

217
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,463
I know. I'm just trying
to get a feel for my gun.

218
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:18,561
Well, you gotta get a feel for it,
and quick, OK? So, why don't you,

219
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:19,896
shoot Dennis.

220
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:25,528
Great. This is just like a war movie.
Ethnic guy always dies first.

221
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:32,294
Gary, if tom's truly a pacifist, perhaps
intimidation isn't the best motivator.

222
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:36,032
You wanna take over here? You wanna
be responsible for 4 souls out there,

223
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:37,797
walkin'the wire? Is that what you want?

224
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,948
- Actually, I'd be happy.
- Yeah, I didn't think so. Look. Dad,

225
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:45,096
Dennis, Tom, you guys form
a perimeter and meet back here at 03,

226
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:49,392
30, wait, 03, screw it!
3:30, come back at 3...

227
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:52,970
Ditty before they flank us, or we're
gonna end up in a world of hurt.

228
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:55,950
Dad, stop talking like
you were in Vietnam.

229
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,205
You've never been there.
All through the sixties,

230
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:01,070
all you did was manage to freak
out tents at "grateful dead" shows.

231
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,291
I remember you.

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,267
That's good. OK.

233
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:10,881
Let's, let's get out there and hustle.
Tommy, you cover Dennis's rear.

234
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,899
Would guys knock it off?

235
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,890
Come on, get out there, let's go!
Set a perimeter up!

236
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:20,164
Remember the altamont!

237
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,080
I noticed you didn't
give me an assignment.

238
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:25,227
Yeah, I thought it would
be good if you just,

239
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:27,012
stayed back here with me, Krandall.

240
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,640
Can you hand me my gun, Gary?

241
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,336
I'm afraid I can't do that, Walter.

242
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:41,580
You don't want to do this, Gary. What
can you possibly gain by shooting me?

243
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:45,289
For one thing, you'd be out of the game,
I'd have some private time with my son.

244
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:47,408
I'm not standing between you and Tom.

245
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,827
Yeah? Then why does he keep
coming to you for advice?

246
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:53,664
It's normal for teens to confide in
someone other than their parents.

247
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,978
All right. What is he telling you?

248
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:59,672
- I'm afraid that's confidential.
- That's the wrong answer.

249
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,999
Don't shoot me, Gary.

250
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,306
Why not? Give me one
good reason why I shouldn't.

251
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,733
At this close range, you leave
a doozy of a bruise and the guys

252
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:07,545
at the lap pool can be very cruel.

253
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,700
Get down, Gary! Duck!

254
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,919
Oh, my gosh!
It's coming from everywhere!

255
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,496
- Give me my gun. It's your only hope!
- No, I don't trust you!

256
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,952
- You can't afford not to!
- All right then!

257
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,892
I'm serious about Tommy, Krandall!

258
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:24,413
You stay away from him!
I'm his hero, you hear me?!

259
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,231
Ya don't get it, do ya?!

260
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:29,008
- Get what?
- You are his hero.

261
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,267
You're so much his hero, he doesn't
think he'd be able to live up to you.

262
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:35,336
Why would I think that?
He can never let me down.

263
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,380
Look at you, Gary.
You're a tough guy athlete.

264
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:42,428
You lettered in 4 sports, not to mention
your legendary tryout at the dodgers.

265
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:47,558
That's why he's tanking gym class.
It's less painful for him not to try,

266
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,386
rather than risk disappointing you.

267
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,660
- He could never disappoint me!
- Have you told him that?

268
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,593
Some things a son needs
to hear from his father.

269
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,042
All right, all right! Bring it in!

270
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,698
They got us covered from every angle,
I don't know what we're gonna do.

271
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,741
All right, hey, wait a minute.
Where's my dad?

272
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,947
I saw him at the lookout tower.
He said he's gonna smoke out the enemy.

273
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,483
But he said he only had enough
for himself, whatever that means.

274
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:20,403
All right. All right, guys, look,
let's call it a day.

275
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,817
Let's surrender.
I don't want anybody getting hurt, OK?

276
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,563
Surrender? I didn't come all
the way out here to get whacked

277
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:28,303
by 6 floor managers from
scooter's auto sound.

278
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,397
- Tom, we have.
- I'll see you in hell!

279
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,708
Yeah, that's right, dad.
I said hell again.

280
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,373
Who's with me?!

281
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:44,567
What the heck got into him?

282
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:47,440
Probably a combination of gangster rap,
video games,

283
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,454
and that yard long pixie stick
he inhaled at the gas station.

284
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,324
Gary, look out!

285
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:04,712
What did you do that for,
you crazy son of a bitch?

286
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,180
Needs his dad.
In fact, it's all he ever talks about.

287
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,345
When we go for walks around the... the,

288
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,787
- the...
- Krandall, stay with me.

289
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,916
Cul de sac.
I couldn't think of the word.

290
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:22,306
The point is, whenever we're together,

291
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:25,148
all he ever talks about is
how much he looks up to you.

292
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:27,601
Thank you, Walter. Thank you.

293
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:31,165
- I guess this is the end for me.
- Yeah, I...

294
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:32,810
I guess so, Krandall.

295
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,556
So, I'll see you back at the snack room?

296
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,287
Grab me a cheeseburger, would ya?

297
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,790
I'm already dead, for god's sake!

298
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:50,424
Here we go, guys. Ice cold
root beer for the victorious warrior,

299
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:52,862
- and one for Gary.
- All right.

300
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,140
But I'm riding this guy's coattails,
you know? I mean,

301
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,370
he captured the flag,
but I was on his team.

302
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:01,237
So, I'm Kinda making believe
I captured the flag, too.

303
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:05,357
OK, by that same logic,
because of my boyfriend,

304
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,759
I would have 3 nba championship rings.

305
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,445
Wait a minute. That's another clue.
OK, born in Canada,

306
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:14,292
3 championship rings, your, my!
You're dating rick fox?!

307
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,751
I think I said too much.

308
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,404
- You're really dating Rick Fox?
- No, I'm not dating anybody.

309
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:26,168
I just like messing with Gary.

310
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,666
So, Vanessa's dating an ex-laker?
That is so cool.

311
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:34,367
Unless you're the guy that used to date
her. I mean, who can live up to that?

312
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,748
Yeah, but, dad, you're practically
a pro player, yourself.

313
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,738
I mean, you tried out for the Dodgers.

314
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:42,337
Tommy, I probably left out a few
details about that, you know?

315
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,884
The tryout was an invitation
in the newspaper.

316
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:49,073
They said the first 1,500 people
that could get to the park could try out

317
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:51,522
for the dodgers,
and me and my cousin got there.

318
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,735
And... that was it.
My entire tryout was 2 pitches.

319
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:56,598
So, that was your big Dodger tryout?

320
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:58,932
Yeah, I just kind of
exaggerated over the years.

321
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:01,921
I was just a guy that was pretty good
at high school sports, which is nothing

322
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:05,133
to brag about, which is exactly
why I bragged about it constantly.

323
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:11,237
Your paintball story is already epic
compared to my entire sports career.

324
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,627
- You really think so?
- Yeah, hey,

325
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,510
I'm living in your shadow now,
buddy? OK?

326
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:18,220
Thanks, dad.

327
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,615
So what'd you do with those 2 pitches?

328
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,961
Well, the first one I wiffed.
The second one,

329
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,293
I, popped it out to the left fielder.

330
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,142
Yeah, he caught it with his bare hand.

331
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:33,950
But, at least you hit a ball all the way
to the outfield at dodgers stadium.

332
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:36,302
No, no, I didn't say hit
the ball to left field.

333
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:38,507
I said hit the ball
to the left fielder. He was

334
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,651
coming out of the dugout,
adjusting his hat.

335
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:45,782
And he just reached out,
and it Kinda just fell in his bare hand.

336
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,600
But, at least you hit a ball all the way
to the dugout at Dodgers'stadium.

337
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:52,143
You know I did, right?

338
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,829
I took this one near the end
of the battle,

339
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:59,049
- when I was unwrapping a stick of gum.
- That's nothing.

340
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,638
I took this one coming
out of the men's room.

341
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,493
- That's your own paint, isn't it?
- Yeah.

342
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,517
Just had to get out of that hell hole.

343
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,892
I didn't like what it was doing to me,

344
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,337
I kept wasting guys
and I didn't feel a thing.

345
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,702
I feel weird.
Maybe you're hungry.

346
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:19,675
Have you eaten anything since
the breakfast sandwich incident?

347
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:22,576
Yeah. I had a couple of brownies
out of Jack's backpack.

348
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,284
Why don't you sit here?

349
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:33,015
OK, little brother,

350
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,463
you're safe and warm
on a planet that loves you.

351
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,891
Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!

352
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:47,391
Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!

353
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:51,797
- Help me out.
- Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah!

354
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:57,351
- What's going on over here?
- Dennis got into my brownies.

355
00:19:58,337 --> 00:20:00,952
Someone's high, my lord

356
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,303
kumbayah!

357
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,930
Someone's high!
Someone's high, my lord...

358
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:12,245
It feels good to wash
all this paint off, Tommy!

359
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,013
All right, I'm all done.
The shower's all yours, son!

360
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:16,853
Hey, dad, heads up!

361
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:22,859
Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd
turn into it. I mean, I said head's up.

362
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:30,383
I'm so proud of you!

363
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:35,803
- Thanks, dad.
- Go get me a bag of frozen peas.

364
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:40,735
A very large bag of frozen peas!
