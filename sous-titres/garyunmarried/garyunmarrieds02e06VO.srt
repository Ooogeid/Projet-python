1
00:00:03,723 --> 00:00:06,307
- Sorry I'm late, Allison.
- That's the fifth time in 2 weeks.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,683
At least when we were married,
I could hope you were having an affair.

3
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:11,517
I always hoped you were having one.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,718
Why do you think I always paid for
your tennis lessons with Javier?

5
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:17,683
Look, Gary, I know you're juggling a lot
of stuff since you took the radio job,

6
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,726
but, you're dropping balls
left and right.

7
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:21,268
You're late constantly,

8
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:24,437
you shrunk Louise's ballet costume,
and you ate Tom's home Ec homework.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,601
All right.
If you have homework as a Frittata,

10
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:29,034
don't leave it out on the table
when I wake up at night to pee.

11
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:30,117
I know.

12
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,371
What's up, bro?

13
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:33,967
- Can I get a hug?
- No.

14
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:36,454
I was talking to Allison.

15
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:40,317
Hey, guys. Quick, get in the car.
We're going right to daddy's house.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,350
No, dad, I have youth orchestra tonight.

17
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:45,230
OK. Great. Just put your cello behind
the van ²and I'll put it in the back?

18
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,887
Honey. Have fun, OK? And Tom,
please, get a good night's sleep,

19
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,820
'cause you got your first
swim meet tomorrow.

20
00:00:49,903 --> 00:00:52,134
Thanks for reminding me.
Gotta shave down tonight.

21
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,436
Shave what?

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,697
So, those 4 chest hairs I showed you,
just part of my imagination? What?

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,708
I almost forgot. I got the bill for
Louise's youth orchestra.

24
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,588
It seemed pretty expensive. I could see
if the orchestra played a little, like,

25
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:08,536
rush or AC/DC or something.

26
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:12,015
Well, Gary, you knew it was gonna
be expensive once she got accepted.

27
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,968
I know. Look. Don't worry about it.
I got things coming in.

28
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,627
A lot of people are still
hitting me up for painting jobs.

29
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:21,037
I'll handle it. I'll just add it to the
zero time that I have.

30
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:23,884
Who needs those 4 hours
I set aside for sleep anyway?

31
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:26,106
We better get going to the movie.

32
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,953
You're going to the movies with Allison?

33
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,869
Let me give you a tip.
When she offers you her junior mints,

34
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,413
she doesn't mean it.

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,710
You'd share your junior mints with me,
wouldn't you, sweetie?

36
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,135
Of course I would.

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,103
How many do you want?
We could always get 2 boxes.

38
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:47,562
- What was that?
- Dad, my cello!

39
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,218
Upsy daisy.

40
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,329
- You guys got any tape?
- Oh, my god!

41
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,472
Gary, that cello cost $2,000!

42
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:58,167
Howard, can you just can
you give us a second, OK?

43
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:01,296
- Where is your head?
- Why don't you leave me alone?

44
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,372
It's one thing. I've been up since
2:00 am. So, I killed a cello.

45
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:08,083
Look, that... That's the thing.
You're spreading yourself to thin.

46
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,843
You're doing 10 things at the same time

47
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,443
and you're only average
when you try to do one.

48
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,196
Glad you noticed. It's hard to maintain
that standard all the time.

49
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:18,649
Listen,

50
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,389
I was wondering if maybe,

51
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,819
just for a while,
i'd take the kids an extra day.

52
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:27,476
No way. We're not changing
the custody schedule, OK?

53
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,619
I promised the kids I would
always be there for them.

54
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:31,605
I'm not gonna you know
go back on my words now.

55
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:33,640
I'm not giving you any of my days.
Forget it.

56
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,781
Just rember you got a lot
of stuff going on tomorrow.

57
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,955
OK? Tom's swim practice
is in the morning at...

58
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,289
Hold on a second.

59
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:42,561
They gave me, one of these fancy
Blackberrys over at the radio station.

60
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:45,012
You tell me and I'll put it
in this puppy right here.

61
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,678
He has to be there by 6:30 am,

62
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,672
so, you have to take him
there after your show.

63
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,431
And then after school Louise is
a volunteer at the animal shelter, and

64
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:54,265
then the swim meet, and then
Louise's Orchestra recital.

65
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,010
You got all that?

66
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,640
How do you turn this on?
Is it on the top?

67
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:01,969

Team Subs-Addicts"

70
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,472
I got here as fast as I could.
What's the Crisis?

71
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:15,573
Remember that endorsement spot for red
pirate pizza that recorded this morning?

72
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,194
- No.
- Let me refresh your memory.

73
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:19,300
The guy from red pirate
pizza was standing there.

74
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:21,786
I was standing over here,
and you didn't show up.

75
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,429
The guy came in costume.

76
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,539
You know how awkward that was?

77
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,562
You know what? We have to do
it right now, OK? So, sit down.

78
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,569
I'm sorry. Jeez,
I've been up since 2:00 am, Curtis.

79
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,632
Besides, Red Pirate pizza stinks.

80
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,488
The only reason they don't have rats is
'cause the rats have tried the pizza.

81
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:43,953
And you're on.

82
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,072
Hey there, Los Angeles.
This is KPPQ sports guy Gary Brooks,

83
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:49,605
and when I'm not at the game,

84
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:53,075
i'm watching with my friends
at Red Pirate pizza.

85
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,384
Red Pirate Pizza!

86
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,620
Put some treasure in your mouth!

87
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:06,105
You hungry?

88
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,560
And we're good.

89
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:11,065
You know,
a little piece of my soul just left.

90
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:14,611
- OK, you gotta sign these releases.
- Then, I gotta get out of here.

91
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:17,389
I took out another paint job,
and I gotta meet my crew in 20 minutes.

92
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:19,523
I thought you were pulling
back on the painting jobs.

93
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:22,581
I'm trying to, but this very frustrating
thing keeps happening. I go to the bank

94
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,568
and I tell them I owe more
money than I make,

95
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:26,920
and the bank says they have
the same problem.

96
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:33,115
Man, you know, I would love to give you
some money, but I know you'd say "no."

97
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,408
And if you called my bluff,
then we'd both be embarrassed.

98
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,443
What I need more than money is time.
Allison asked me last night

99
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:42,429
wanted to change the custody arrangement
so she could take the kids more.

100
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:45,591
I swore after the divorce, even though
I would only see my kids 1/2 of the time

101
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:48,020
I would never let them down.
I would always be there for them.

102
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:50,034
Everybody knows
that you're great with your kids.

103
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:52,791
But nobody would blame you if you
felt like you had to change it up.

104
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:55,347
No, I got it covered, OK?
Look, Tommy has a swim meet and,

105
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,838
Louise has this youth Orchestra thing
I'm gonna attend.

106
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,515
I'm gonna be front and center for
both of those events. You watch.

107
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,790
Guys, just a reminder
about the promotional event

108
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:05,178
we're co-hosting with
Adrena Power Energy Drink.

109
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,176
It's mandatory
that everyone be there tonight.

110
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,307
No, that's not tonight.
That's tomorrow night.

111
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,122
No, it got changed to tonight.

112
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:12,888
I sent an e-mail to your Blackberry.

113
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,320
Really? Why don't you show me where
in the Blackberry that is,

114
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,055
'cause I never got your e-mail.

115
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,773
It's right here.

116
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:21,107
Under where it says
"50 unread messages."

117
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,578
And I think you accidentally
took a picture of your thumb.

118
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:30,050
OK, you know, I am gonna tell
myself that that's your thumb.

119
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:33,564
Look Sasha.

120
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,818
- My kids have important things.
- Is there any way no more.

121
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,357
- So I don't have to go?
- No, I mean don't say any more.

122
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,991
You're coming to the event because
you're doing an hour live there.

123
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,714
But let me put your mind
at ease about something.

124
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,722
My dad missed almost every event
I was ever involved in.

125
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:50,785
I was sad and hurt, but

126
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,679
11 years of intense therapy,
and I turned out fine.

127
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:01,347
Hey, Curtis?
Why are you here so early?

128
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,357
I sent you an e-mail
about the time change.

129
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,051
Man, you gotta start checking those.

130
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:07,794
My fingers are too fat to
press the right buttons, OK?

131
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,338
There I said it. What's the big deal?
I thought I start at 6:00 pm.

132
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,670
No, set-up is at 6:00 pm
You're on at 7:00 pm.

133
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:16,868
Damn it. This whole night depends on
everything happening on time, you know?

134
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:20,042
All right, I'm gonna run over to Tom's
swim meet and then, i'll come back here.

135
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,671
I'll do my hour. And then I will go
to Louise's youth Orchestra thing.

136
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:26,233
See? I can figure out
a way to do everything.

137
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:33,513
Easy now. There's some things you
can't do, even if you think you can.

138
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,717
No, no. It's just nice to see
sasha in her out-of-work clothes.

139
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,979
Although, I would like to see her
out of her out-of-work clothes.

140
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,295
I'm telling you,
you do not want to get mixed up in that.

141
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:46,423
You have to admit, it's pretty hard,
working for a boss that's that...

142
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,679
I was gonna say "hot,"
but I yawn.

143
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,305
You are wiped?
Yeah, I'm pretty tired.

144
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:57,965
I'm running on fumes, here, Curtis.

145
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,843
OK, well, you know what, buddy?
We gotta pick you up, then, OK?

146
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,559
- What's this?
- Adrena power energy drink.

147
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:06,005
A few of these will do the trick.
They're our corporate sponsors

148
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:07,995
so don't
say too loud how nasty they are.

149
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,409
Kinda numbs the tongue.

150
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:14,036
And also, if you spill any
on your crotch area,

151
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,976
flush it with water and then,
call the number on the back of the can.

152
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:23,795
Swim, swim!

153
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,818
Dig it out, Tommy!
You got it!

154
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,398
Yes! He won!

155
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,626
In your face! In your face, face, face!

156
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,647
That's my son!
That is my son! He won!

157
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,267
- Hey, dad. What's up?
- This is my son.

158
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:42,072
We just got here. My race isn't till
after the individual medley.

159
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,080
Really?

160
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,511
The medley's the one
where they swim a series...

161
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:48,623
- Excuse me, needleman?
- I know what a medley is, OK, fella?

162
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,953
- Where they do all 3 strokes.
- It's actually 4 strokes.

163
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:55,251
- It's butter, back, breast and free.
- Look, I know.

164
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:58,853
But I'm going by the first
Olympics ever in ancient,

165
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,303
France, when they only had, like,
3 strokes because they thought the

166
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,843
breast, stroke was profane, so.

167
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:08,441
When, when do you swim?
What's going on here?

168
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,071
- I don't know. Maybe about 1/2 hour?
- What? 1/2 hour?

169
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,318
- What, do you have to be somewhere?
- What? No way.

170
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,470
Right here's where I need to be,
watching my, watching my son swim.

171
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:18,743
That's right.
I just hope you don't have to

172
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,369
race against that other Tom.
That kid was amazing.

173
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,184
Where were you?

174
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,231
I watched my son swim the slowest 50
meter in the history of water sports.

175
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,461
It was embarrassing.

176
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,803
I was calling you.

177
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,267
I can't answer my phone,

178
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,576
whenever I pick it up, I accidentally
speed dial some guy named luther.

179
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,125
Nice guy. I think I'm gonna buy
his dirt bike. Let's hit the Mike.

180
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,925
There's been a little change in the
schedule. I think it getting pushed back

181
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:48,841
because we had an unexpected celebrity
appearance. John Stamos showed up.

182
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,114
Really? That's cool.
Who's the celebrity?

183
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:55,245
John Stamos. Now, apparently,
he's gonna be playing the bongos,

184
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:56,990
so you're not on for another 90 minutes.

185
00:08:57,073 --> 00:08:58,536
You gotta be kidding me.

186
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,960
All right. You know what?
This will work out.

187
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:03,830
This will be OK.
I'm gonna go, to Louise's recital,

188
00:09:03,913 --> 00:09:06,643
the youth Orchestra thing. Hopefully
she'll be up right when I get there.

189
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:10,240
And she will see me in the audience
giving her her first standing ovation.

190
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:12,251
- That is sweet, man...
- I need some energy.

191
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:15,452
I need some more of these drinks. I'll
take the whole tray. Thank, sweetheart.

192
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:18,058
- See you later, Curtis. I'll be back.
- Be careful.

193
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,622
Hello?
Hey, Luther, what's up?

194
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,763
A sofa sleeper? I don't know.
I'd have to come look at it.

195
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,876
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

196
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,286
Sorry, lady.

197
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,437
Tom's swim meet, check.
Louise's concert recital, check.

198
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,151
Seeing both kids, check and mate.
I'm always there for my kids.

199
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:43,277
Apology accepted. What time
does the youth orchestra start here?

200
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:46,864
- 1 hour and 15 minutes.
- What? I can't wait that long.

201
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,068
You know, to see Louise,
'cause I'm so excited about this.

202
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,778
She's on after Rimsky-Korsakov.

203
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,581
Which one is he? There's like 50 guys up
there and none of really look Russian.

204
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,949
Is it that chick with the eyebrow?

205
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,150
Rimsky-Korsakov is the composer,
Gary, and he's dead.

206
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:05,769
I didn't know that, but,
you know, that's

207
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:08,311
just probably 'cause I got laid
in high school.

208
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,770
High school was tough for me.
I was such a nerd.

209
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:16,723
But then, I started a company in
my garage, sold it for $600 million.

210
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,628
Got to the point where getting laid,
for me, was boring.

211
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,873
Really? That's great. Then you guys
are gonna get along perfectly.

212
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:28,109
Just stop moving.
What's wrong with your leg?

213
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,634
Nothing wrong with my leg. Whenever I'm
near you, my leg's instinct is to run.

214
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:36,135
Gary, I've seen you through
15 years and 3 jeans sizes.

215
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:38,516
Trust me. Your instinct is not to run.

216
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:42,555
If you're pressed for time, gary,
i'd be happy to tape louise for you.

217
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:44,194
This bad boy is HD.

218
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,820
Nice try, needleman. No matter what,
I'm gonna catch my daughter.

219
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:50,310
I don't care how much
nimsky I gotta sit through.

220
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:53,609
I know. This is the best part, right?

221
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,995
Can I get another one of these?
Thanks a lot.

222
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,234
Where have you been?

223
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:05,736
That's a weird question. "Where have?"
I've been a lot of places.

224
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:09,390
Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns,
Yellowstone park, New Orleans.

225
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:12,617
Once I went to, grand Island in
Nebraska to see my grandmother.

226
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,435
It wasn't grand and it wasn't an island.
It's a crazy state.

227
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,754
OK, you gotta lay off these things.
All right? You have just barely made it.

228
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:21,690
You're on in 5, 4, 3...

229
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,128
2, all right.

230
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:25,933
Hey, everybody.
Welcome to the score with Gary Brooks.

231
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,895
Brought to you by
Adrena Power Energy Drink.

232
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,372
Yeah! This thing makes cocaine
look like baby aspirin.

233
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:34,627
That's not their official
slogan or anything. Yet.

234
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,637
Yet! That's not their official slogan.

235
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,773
These things are amazing.
I had like 20 of 'em today.

236
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,059
I feel like I got a cheetah
tail growing out of my ass.

237
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:43,978
Argh! You hungry!

238
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,350
Thanks, once again,
to my friends Adrena Power.

239
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,873
Adrena Power.
Drink it or get the hell outta my way.

240
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:54,671
That is not their official slogan either
by the way, my name is Gary Brooks.

241
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,652
This is the score.
I'm done.

242
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:00,776
Nice. That show was unbelievable.

243
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:03,837
I have never heard somebody say
so many words in so little time.

244
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,076
- I was talking fast?
- Were you talking fast?

245
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,703
You named every major
league player in 28 seconds.

246
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:12,569
I did. I almost got tripped up
on nomar Garciaparra,

247
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,233
but I just plowed through it.

248
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,322
OK, but why don't you
come down and relax?

249
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:19,293
- Just take a second, OK?
- OK. Hey, why are you talking so slow?

250
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,688
Grab a table and chill, OK?

251
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:25,045
I'm gonna hang with John Stamos
for a while? He's got a V.I.P. Table.

252
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,636
Well, actually, it's just a table
with John Stamos sitting at it, but.

253
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:31,384
Who cares, man?
I'm partyin' with uncle Jesse!

254
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:34,918
Brooks, you sounded great.

255
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:37,255
Right.
Why are you talking so slow?

256
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:41,702
I was listening with all the executives,
who made me do a shot of vodka

257
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:44,106
every time you said
"Adrena Power" on the air.

258
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,061
I don't know how many
times you said it, but!

259
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:49,752
There's a chance
I'm engaged to one of them.

260
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,829
Hey! You wanna dance?
Hey, let's dance.

261
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,468
This'll be good.
I love this song.

262
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,904
Hey, you know, you're Kinda fun, Brooks.

263
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:06,374
I've been wanting to tell you.
Now, I'm sorry I'm so uptight at work.

264
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:09,662
I'm really not like that.
You know, I'm actually Kinda fun.

265
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,847
Just under a lot of pressure, you know?

266
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,496
Yeah, tell me about it.
I know all about pressure.

267
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:18,266
Hey, that's a great shirt.

268
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:21,006
You know they sell
Calvin Klein at costco?

269
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:26,403
I did it all today.
I did it all.

270
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:27,930
I went to the orchestra.

271
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:30,940
I went to the swim meet.
I painted. I did my little radio job.

272
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:34,113
I'm mister do it all,
big winner radio, fun time dance man.

273
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:37,889
- What? I can't hear you.
- I said,

274
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,743
I did it all. I can do it all.
Like, I feel like i'm invulnerable.

275
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:43,971
I can do anything,
except, all of a sudden,

276
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,635
I have this pain in my chest.

277
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,332
- What?
- I don't know.

278
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:50,899
I don't feel so good. My heart's
pounding. I can hear it in my ears.

279
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:54,346
I gotta stay sitting down.
Is it hot and dark in here?

280
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,399
But I don't know. It's hard to tell
because it's hot and dark in here.

281
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,130
Is it especially hot and dark in here?

282
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,620
- I don't know.
- I can't catch my breath.

283
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,339
Call 9-1. Go ahead.
Call 9-1.

284
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,763
- Call 9-1.
- I don't have my phone.

285
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,114
- Do you do you have your Blackberry?
- I got my Blackberry.

286
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,763
I'll call 9-1-1 myself.

287
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,293
Hello, Luther?

288
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:18,812
Call 9-1.

289
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,801
I'm gonna pass on the sofa sleeper.

290
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,818
I'm in hell!

291
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:36,603
What did I do wrong in my life?
Why did I wind up in hell?

292
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:40,694
Gary, you're OK. You're in the hospital.
But thank you for that reaction.

293
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:43,494
I'm glad I got out of bed and ran
across town to be here for you.

294
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,431
What happened?
Did I have a heart attack?

295
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:49,078
It wasn't a heart attack.
Hi, I'm Dr. Greenberg.

296
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,698
- Greenberg?
- Adopted.

297
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,234
Well, the good news is
you're going to be OK.

298
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:58,163
The bad news...
Well, should we excuse everyone?

299
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:00,645
They're gonna find out anyway.
Might as well just tell 'em now.

300
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:04,240
Well, you didn't have a heart attack.
You had an anxiety attack.

301
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:05,549
That's embarrassing.

302
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:08,002
- Followed by some pretty severe gas.
- Dude.

303
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,304
It's OK. It's all right, Curtis.
At least that's the worst of it, right?

304
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:14,567
There was also explosive diarrhea.

305
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:18,798
All right.

306
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,599
For the record,
I did offer to clear the room?

307
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:28,024
At least now, I gotta be honest with you
I feel pretty relaxed and comfortable.

308
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,563
That'll be the valium.

309
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,877
Doctor, what do you think
brought all this on?

310
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,356
Well, from what we could tell
from your urine sample,

311
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,184
which, by the way,
was the largest I've ever seen, yeah!

312
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,434
It seems you consumed a massive amount

313
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:45,538
of caffeine, taurine,
glucosamine and vitamin b12.

314
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:46,960
That'd be the Adrena Power.

315
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:49,095
Those energy drinks
really make the heart race,

316
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:51,258
and if you're already feeling
stressed or rundown,

317
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,207
there's your anxiety attack right there.

318
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,765
I'll be back in a minute.

319
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,178
Well, I guess I can't do everything.

320
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:03,637
Gary, I have a proposal that might
help if you're willing to hear it.

321
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:06,831
If it involves switching up the custody
arrangement, just forget it, OK?

322
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:09,680
I don't care if I gotta walk around
holding an oxygen tank and

323
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:13,472
be hooked up to Adrena Power i V,
i'm not switching any of the days.

324
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,721
I'm keeping all
my time with my children.

325
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,924
I just brought that up
'cause I was trying to help.

326
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,878
You have to get past the idea
that everything I say is a threat.

327
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,166
Or else what?

328
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,667
Please, just,
can you forget the custody thing?

329
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,898
All right, what I'm proposing is this.

330
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,948
What if I take over some of
the managing of the paint business?

331
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:34,530
What? You'd be my boss?

332
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:35,786
Oh, my God!

333
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:41,596
No. Sorry. That was me. I was
just fiddling with the buttons here.

334
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,582
I think my company makes these.

335
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,191
No, Gary, not your boss.

336
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,905
Just, you know,
help out however I could.

337
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:52,319
Dispatching the crews, picking
up the supplies, whatever you think.

338
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:55,516
I don't think you understand how that
painting company has defined my life,

339
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,651
from the first time I picked
out that wreck of a van,

340
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:00,176
to hiring crews, half of the time,
they don't even show up,

341
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,385
breathing fumes all day, every day,

342
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:05,564
having customers that are never happy,
always yelling at me.

343
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,829
The paint that never comes out. You know
what? Actually, you can have it.

344
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,115
- You're welcome, Gary.
- All right.

345
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,892
You know what? I'm pretty tired.
Can you guys get out of the room...

346
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:18,077
Everybody, clear out.
My boy needs some space in here?

347
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,220
Curtis, could you...
You, too. Please?

348
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,731
I'm the one had to pull his pants off.

349
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,758
- I just wanted to have a...
- yeah. Go ahead.

350
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,336
Yeah. I don't mind.

351
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,727
Hey, that was,
that was really fun

352
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,759
- tonight.
- Yeah, I had fun.

353
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:46,198
- Up until the point where you...
- Yes, I yeah, I know.

354
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,754
I'm glad you're OK.

355
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,668
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

356
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,797
She's cute.

357
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,152
I know.

358
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:04,917
- She's young.
- I know.

359
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,131
You had explosive
diarrhea in front of her.

360
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:11,979
I know.

361
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:18,180
You OK? You really had me worried.

362
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,695
I'm OK. I just feel like an idiot,
you know?

363
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:23,671
I have to make sure, no matter
what happens, I put the kids first.

364
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:27,164
No matter what, the kids come first.
Like they always have. That's all.

365
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,642
I know.

366
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:31,252
All right,
I'm gonna let you get some rest, OK?

367
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:42,209
Look, I know we don't, you know,
do this together anymore, but...

368
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,010
I can't do it alone without you.

369
00:18:47,846 --> 00:18:49,312
I know.
Me neither.

370
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,042
Allison, wait.
What's Allison?

371
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,537
What's this button do?

372
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,739
Allie.
You never told.

373
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,300
Hello, happy.

374
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:19,189
OK, Mr. Deacons, we'll have a paint
crew out there at 8:00 am. On wednesday.

375
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,650
All right. Yeah, I gotta run.
I got another call. OK.

376
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,846
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Anderson.

377
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,818
Yeah, listen, the paint crew said
they accidentally fell into the pool.

378
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,174
I can't really explain the beach ball.

379
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,987
Can you help me
with a few of these calls?

380
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,116
Jeez, al, I'm Kinda busy now
watching sports, you know?

381
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,845
I have to for my radio gig.
Hey, get me another beer.

382
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:45,396
It's good for my anxiety.
That's what dr. Greenberg said.

383
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,973
Mrs. Anderson? That's just the schedule.
I can't really do anything about that.

384
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,804
Yeah, I know it's repetitive,
but that's the music they like.
