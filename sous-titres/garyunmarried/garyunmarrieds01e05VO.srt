1
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:18,191
Gary, you home?

2
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:22,414
You trying to lock me out?

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,716
You didn't step in the bear trap,
and I guess the anvil missed you.

4
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:29,902
Nonstop cartoon references.

5
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:31,439
I don't Miss that.

6
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:34,921
I picked up Louise's basketball uniform.

7
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:37,269
Now, you're sure you're
ready to coach girls basketball?

8
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:40,364
Are you kidding me? I can't wait.
The rest of the teams are gonna cower

9
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,462
in fear at the sight
of bonnie's organic market.

10
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:49,146
Look, Gary, just rember that their
last coach had a strict philosophy of

11
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:50,686
non-competive competion.

12
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,957
OK, well, the new coach has a
strict philosophy about their old coach:

13
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:56,530
get a haircut, get a job,
you dirty hippie.

14
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,713
That's nice. Nice.
Gary, where are the kids?

15
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:02,894
I got stuck at a job. Vanessa's picking
them up. She helps me out.

16
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,450
- Does she do that a lot?
- Sometimes.

17
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,604
Right now,
I think she's taking them for ice cream.

18
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,500
Ice cream? Before dinner.
You think that's a good idea?

19
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,690
Well, they're having ice cream for
dinner, so I didn't think it mattered.

20
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:18,754
- The kids are right behind me.
- Thanks for helping me out.

21
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:20,404
Hey, guys.

22
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:23,489
Check it out, mom.
Vanessa took us to get tattoos.

23
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:28,567
Look at that.
My son has a giant snake on his arm.

24
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:30,703
- Neat.
- Don't worry.

25
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:33,591
They'll be gone in,
like, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks tops.

26
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,799
Vanessa said it would draw attention
on my guns.

27
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:40,872
You're gonna need those guns
to fight all the girls.

28
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,436
Look at mine, mom.

29
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:46,422
Look at that. The recycling symbol.

30
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:51,413
It took forever.
The guy can do 20 types of unicorns

31
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:54,463
but couldn't get his head around
a triangle made out of arrows.

32
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,191
Thanks, V.
You coming to the game tonight?

33
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:01,465
- I'm gonna be the referee.
- I'll be there, T.

34
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:02,954
T? V? What?

35
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:08,160
You don't think that
temporary tattoos could

36
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,543
be a gateway to permanent tattoos?

37
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:13,169
- Well, I.
- I'll take this one. Come on, Allison.

38
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:16,141
You take the kids to the street fair,
you don't care when they get their faces

39
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,924
painted there. You don't think that's a
gateway to permanent clownhood, do you?

40
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,705
I'm sorry. I was just trying to kill
some time between dinner and school.

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,910
Yeah, that's it.
Fine, really. But

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,190
you know, a trip to the library
wouldn't have been a bad idea, so...

43
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:37,924
Yeah. That's great.

44
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,635
And then the kids could have looked up
a bunch of words like passive

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,179
and aggressive.

46
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,673
I'm just socking off the floor.
Time to move it along, show's over.

47
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:49,814
I'll talk to you later, OK?
What are you doing?

48
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,876
Why are you so afraid
of letting me talk to her?

49
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,957
I'm not afraid of you talking to her.
I'm afraid of you unhinging your Jaw

50
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:56,560
and swallowing her whole.

51
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:00,204
I'm just trying to find out something

52
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,428
about this woman who
spend so much time with our kids.

53
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,476
I mean, how do I know
she's not a bad influence?

54
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,391
She's a good influence.
She told me she was a good influence.

55
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,916
Or maybe she said she
was under the influence.

56
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,398
Come on, she's a good girl.
She's got great judgment.

57
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,846
Really? You know what, Gary?
I think there are, what,

58
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,666
4 billion men out there,
and she picked you. Now,

59
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,663
I don't know what the opposite
of winning the lottery is,

60
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:23,933
but damn, I think she got it.

61
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,021
She took the kids out for fun, Allison.
Is that OK?

62
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:30,293
You remember fun. It's part of your

63
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,860
axis of evil along with Joy
and laughter.

00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:43,194
All right, guys, listen up.
We're playing Hanson's dry cleaning, OK?

68
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,358
They're faster than us.
They're taller than us.

69
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,905
And their uniforms are
beautifully pressed and starched,

70
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,770
but listen,
I think we can beat them, all right?

71
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,703
Good luck, coach.

72
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,532
Hey, Vanessa,
look, this gym has a strict rule.

73
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,968
You can't come out the court unless
you're wearing a super hot

74
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:00,895
- cheerleader uniform.
- Too bad. I left mine at home.

75
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,116
You really have a hot
cheerleader uniform?

76
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,495
- 2 minutes, coach. 2 minutes.
- What's with the shades?

77
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,066
Your sunglasses.
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

78
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,705
I'm just getting a lot
of glare off the court.

79
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:16,884
Hey, V.

80
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,396
Hi, Tom.
Did you color in that tattoo?

81
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:24,212
Yeah. I'm turning it into coral snake.

82
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:25,655
It's beautiful.

83
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,809
But also dangerous.

84
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:34,293
All the signs are there.
The sunglasses, the whistle.

85
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:36,388
I'm raising a small-town sheriff.

86
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:40,705
All right, team, bring it in.
We're gonna dominate on 3.

87
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,196
1, 2, 3, dominate! Yeah.

88
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,643
You know,

89
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:47,500
if we all say it together,
it sounds a lot scarier, OK?

90
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:51,341
Dad, our last coach said it isn't
about the number on the scoreboard.

91
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,933
- The numbe of friends you make.
- OK, girls,

92
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:55,790
i'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,256
Losers don't deserve friends.
Get out there and win, win!

94
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:01,561
Let's Go!

95
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,774
Check it out. Your ex-wife sitting
next to your girlfriend.

96
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,077
Oh, my gosh. That's awful.
Those 2 are not a good combination.

97
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:12,147
Yesterday, I had to get right
in between them when they were.

98
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,331
Hugging?

99
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,916
You were between them
when they were hugging?

100
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:22,333
Which way were you facing?
'cause I got to tell you, I'd be torn.

101
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,589
No. They were fighting yesterday.
They're hugging now.

102
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,577
But this is much worse,
this is way worse.

103
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,024
I gotta break this up.

104
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,416
I got earrings on your forward here,
coach. Jewelry is not regulation.

105
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:36,845
I thought studs were OK.

106
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,133
No studs, no hoops, no danglers.
Check your rule book.

107
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,761
I would check my rule
book except the referee spilled

108
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,984
his count chocula
all over it this morning.

109
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:45,449
Here, have a seat.

110
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,785
Here we go. All right, Dennis,
what are they doing now?

111
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,015
They're talking and they're laughing.

112
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,143
And they're totally looking right at me.

113
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:57,556
What's up, ladies?

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,356
Are you doing? They're not
looking at you. They're looking at me.

115
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:03,152
Why couldn't they be looking at me?

116
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,690
Hey, coach, we're waiting on you!

117
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:07,742
I've got earrings here.
I'm working on it.

118
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,598
Go ahead, sweetheart, you're OK.

119
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,509
You're a very handsome man, Dennis.

120
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:13,663
But I'm the only thing
they have in common?

121
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,620
The person that hates
me the most is talking

122
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:18,124
to the person that likes me the most.
I can't have that.

123
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:21,596
Allison has 4 quarters to tell
Vanessa every stupid thing I ever did,

124
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:24,998
every dumb thing I every said,
every stupid thing I ever tried to eat.

125
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:29,074
Dude, you're right. The worst thing is,
if they keep talking,

126
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,553
sooner or later conversation's
bound to get around to your junk.

127
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,728
Too late.

128
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:45,279
The game's changed
a lot since I was a kid.

129
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:47,487
You played basketball?

130
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:51,029
Point guard.
I was lethal at the top of the key.

131
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,552
I could drain it from the corner,
I could dish it from the paint.

132
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,398
I was unstoppable.

133
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,411
Hey, Vanessa, you have to finish
telling me that lake havasu story.

134
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,348
Right. So,

135
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:18,019
all 6 girls are skinny-dipping,
and nobody rembers to turn off the boat.

136
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,397
Oh, my god. So it's what?
Like, the entire boat just drove away?

137
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,077
Yeah! And an hour later,
a couple of high school boys pull up

138
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:29,185
in a fishing boat and they
drive us back to the shore very slowly.

139
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:33,180
You know, when I was in the sorority,
we all went skinny-dipping once.

140
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:36,581
I mean, I left my bra and underwear on,
but it was very exhilarating.

141
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,108
What's going on?
What are you guys doing?

142
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:43,410
Vanessa, was just telling me this
really funny story about lake havasu.

143
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,671
That story.
I love that story.

144
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:50,454
All the kids are very thirsty outside.
Can you please bring them some juice?

145
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:51,804
That's good.

146
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,263
We got to keep them hydrated.
Go ahead, right out there.

147
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,128
When I get back, i'll tell you
my cabo story. It's insane.

148
00:07:58,382 --> 00:07:59,735
That cabo story.

149
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:02,452
- What the heck are you doing?
- What? What do you mean?

150
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,375
Why try to be friends
with my girlfriend?

151
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,145
You wouldn't tell me anything about her,
so I had to find out for myself.

152
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,877
And you'll be happy
to know I think she's great.

153
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,412
She sort of reminds me of me.

154
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,468
In what alternate universe?

155
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:20,269
In the same universe where a girl like
that is attracted to a guy like you.

156
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,867
Gary, I just think she's lovely,
all right?

157
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:27,007
Good. Then you guys can go back
to arguing about tattoos, then, OK?

158
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,181
Gary, please,
they're henna, they'll wash off.

159
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,306
- Fluids are replaced.
- Sunblock. Girls need sunblock.

160
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,678
I told their parents they couldn't
go back old and leathery.

161
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:37,273
That's good.
Thanks a lot.

162
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,876
This is a good thing. I like Vanessa.
I could even see hanging out with her.

163
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,252
You cannot hang out with her.
You can maybe talk to her.

164
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:48,320
You can appreciate her.
You can be jealous that

165
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,529
your scales aren't
as soft as her skin. But...

166
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,866
you cannot hang out with her.

167
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:58,619
What would possibly wrong with your
girlfriend getting along with ex-wife?

168
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,511
How would you like it if I hung
out with your fiance all the time?

169
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,176
Hey, what's up?
You want to hang out sometime?

170
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:08,492
- No, thank you.
- What?

171
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:11,031
Why not?

172
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:15,448
I say this at the risk of sounding
superior, but you're beneath me.

173
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,320
Vanessa, where did you say
you got that belt again?

174
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,605
Stella on melrose.

175
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,434
You know? I have something I need
to return there. Do you want go with me?

176
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,728
No, Allison does
not want to go with you.

177
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,151
- Gary, yes, I would love to go.
- No, actually, she doesn't.

178
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,876
She changed her mind. She told me
she doesn't want to go out with you.

179
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:36,556
- I would.
- Would not.

180
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:39,719
She's trying to say she would not. She
doesn't want to spend time with you.

181
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:42,603
Here's the thing, you guys. You two
shopping together, I got to be honest.

182
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:45,023
I don't think that's
something I would enjoy.

183
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,648
So Vanessa, what time are you thinking?

184
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,893
No, Vanessa. Don't fall for it, OK?

185
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,927
She's not trying to be your friend.
She's just

186
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,904
seeing if you're
a good influence on our kid.

187
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,868
Of course that's what she's doing.
I'm a mom.

188
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,055
I get it. She's checking
out the new girlfriend.

189
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,949
- We're just going shopping, Gary.
- No, you're not.

190
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,783
No. You know what? I'm putting my foot
down. Look, that's my foot. Foot down.

191
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:08,299
I am forbidding you guys
from spending time together.

192
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:10,816
Excuse me.
Did you just say forbidding?

193
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,520
Yes. Forbidding. I'm forbidding
you guys from going out together.

194
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,812
- Forget it.
- Really?

195
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:15,864
Really.

196
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,357
Allison, how about we leave
as so as we're done here?

197
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:20,400
- She can't. She's forbidden.
- You know what?

198
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,066
I would love to,
and there's a SPA near there.

199
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,415
- Is it a forbidden SPA?
- We could both get massages.

200
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,451
No, you can't.

201
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,305
I could probably use massage.
My boyfriend's been stressing me lately.

202
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,567
You're forbidden.

203
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:34,550
Then we can go get drinks afterwards.
You know, maybe flirt with some guys.

204
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,555
That's great.
You're both forbidden!

205
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,225
I'm telling you what to do.
The man of the house has spoken!

206
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,858
My goodness.
Why are you so tense?

207
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,239
This was kind of a last-minute thing,

208
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,887
and I forgot to shave my legs.

209
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:01,409
Let me know if the pressure is OK.

210
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:04,273
Just relax and remember to breathe.

211
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,712
Is everything OK?

212
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,673
Everything is fine.

213
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,367
Everything is nice.
Is the pressure OK?

214
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,508
Oh, good. That's great, thank you.

215
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,307
I notice you wear a wedding ring.
You married?

216
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,768
Engaged, actually.
But I used to be married.

217
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:31,240
Your ex-husband, what's the matter?
You could not please him? What?

218
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:41,050
I mean, maybe your...

219
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:44,309
your ex-husband, he was not pleasing?

220
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:48,001
Not pleasing enough for me
to stay married to him. I'll say!

221
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,708
You know what? That pressure's
getting a little tough there.

222
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:55,607
What could you tell somebody
about your ex-husband

223
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:58,174
if you had a new friend,
maybe a new friend like me?

224
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,126
Well, I'm kind of mad at him right now.

225
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:04,163
But I guess I'd say he was bossy,

226
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,024
paranoid, and selfish.

227
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,178
He's selfish? Yeah, selfish.

228
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:11,010
Even though he offered
to make love to you every night

229
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,193
of the week even when you wore your
retainer and had on your granny pants?

230
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,783
- Selfish my ass...
- What? My God, Gary.

231
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:18,881
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

232
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,447
I wanted to see if you were gonna
talk smack about me and you did.

233
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:22,577
You're crazy!

234
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,245
You badmouthed me to the massage
therapist, a complete stranger.

235
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,912
I can only imagine what kind of
things you're saying to my girlfriend.

236
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:29,688
- Get out of here.
- Look, come on.

237
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,400
I have a clean slate with Vanessa.

238
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:34,276
I don't want you filling her head with
all the bad things you know about me.

239
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:36,587
I will say whatever I want to say,
and you know what?

240
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:40,591
Maybe I will start by telling her
that you interrupted my $160 massage.

241
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,408
You're still mad about that?
Oh, my gosh.

242
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:47,524
I'm not leaving here until you promise
to just stay out of my relationship.

243
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,374
Me? You're the one who messed
things up with your ike turner speech.

244
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:51,944
"I forbid you, woman!"

245
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,650
My god, we're having a good time.

246
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,879
I like Vanessa
She brings out my fun side.

247
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,358
If you have a fun side,
I have a ballroom dancing side, OK?

248
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:04,071
- Is there a problem in here?
- Yeah, this man touched my naked body.

249
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:06,353
Yeah, but that wasn't fun for me either.

250
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:08,305
You have to come with us.

251
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,537
All right,
I don't want to have to do this, fellas

252
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,960
but I'm officer brooks, vice.
I'd like to speak to the owner.

253
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,096
- I am the owner.
- In that case these are for you.

254
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:16,350
Excuse me.

255
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:24,635
Where have you been?

256
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,305
Sorry, Pop.

257
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,163
The plymouth got a flat on
the way home from the record store.

258
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,978
We had to hitch it the whole way back.
What's going on with you, Tom?

259
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,385
- Sit down.
- I'm sitting down. Relax.

260
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,435
What did you say
To Vanessa at the party?

261
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,042
She walked away, she looked upset.
She didn't me even say good-bye.

262
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,296
- Well, I.
- You know, I don't want to hear it.

263
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,646
I just want you to fix it,
and I want you to fix it now.

264
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,988
You're pretty upset about this,
aren't you?

265
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:54,085
I am because I like Vanessa,
and if you're not seeing her,

266
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,666
I'm not seeing her, you follow?

267
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:59,392
OK, let me explain
it to you this way, OK?

268
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,202
Let's say you go to a new school, OK?

269
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:03,522
And you like the new teacher,
but there's an old teacher

270
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:06,566
from the old school that knows
all the bad stuff about you.

271
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:07,817
I get it, dad.

272
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:10,181
You're afraid mom's gonna
tell Vanessa bad stuff about you.

273
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:15,186
Well, I don't know how you
made that leap in your mind, but.

274
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:16,735
You know what?

275
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,315
I am losing patience.

276
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,041
But in that scenario,
I would go to my new teacher

277
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,472
and tell her all the stuff I was afraid
she was gonna hear from the old teacher.

278
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,371
You want me to tell
Vanessa all the things

279
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,381
I'm afraid your mom's
gonna tell her about me?

280
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,042
At least she'll be hearing it from you.

281
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:40,653
All right, thanks.

282
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,180
You're a good man, Tommy.
You've turned into a fine young man.

283
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,172
Thanks, dad.

284
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:48,664
But the onething you have to
remember about women is,

285
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:51,580
they don't usually
have a lot of faith in us.

286
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,822
Yeah. Hey, hey.
Hand it over.

287
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:59,873
You know, one day, I'm gonna
take one of those.

288
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,859
Hey, want to hear something
that will really get you mad?

289
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:04,587
I'm gonna taste them both right now.

290
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,794
- I got to see Vanessa.
- There's a band.

291
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,767
- $5.00 cover.
- Fine.

292
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,334
Here's your $5.00.

293
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:23,031
No. The name of the band is $5.00 cover.

294
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:25,965
It's 10 to get in.

295
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,327
Fine. $10.
Let me in.

296
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,378
I went to stunt man school.

297
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,395
Excuse me?

298
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,194
In 1993 for 3 weeks
I went to stuntman school.

299
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,316
It cost me $12,000,
and on the second day,

300
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:47,273
I sprained my ankle on my way
to falling out of a building class.

301
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,529
I'm a sore loser.
I hold a grudge.

302
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:55,403
I'm very impatient.
So much so that I'll flush

303
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,418
the toilet before
I'm even finished peeing.

304
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:03,412
What are you doing?

305
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:05,538
I'm telling you all
the bad things about me before

306
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:08,399
Allison has a chance to do it.
I just wanted to beat her to the punch.

307
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:12,189
So you think that if Allison tells me
that you flunked out of stuntman school,

308
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:13,629
I'm gonna break up with you?

309
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:16,265
Well, no. I didn't flunk
out of stuntman school.

310
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,837
I tripped over uneven pavement,
and then I quit the next day.

311
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:22,804
Thank you.

312
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:26,177
Gary, why don't you trust
me to make up my own mind about you?

313
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:28,796
I never expected you to be perfect.

314
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,196
Or anything close to perfect.

315
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:35,570
Well, in that case,

316
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:44,436
And you don't have to worry so much
about Allison because you'll be able

317
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:47,588
to hold this night over her
head for a very long, long time.

318
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:49,373
Why? What do you mean?
What's going on?

319
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,962
Wait. Where'd she go?
She was just here.

320
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:55,356
Hey, Vanessa,
she tried to sneak out again.

321
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,682
Oh, my god, that's Allison.

322
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:05,346
Every time I walk outside,
I end up right back here.

323
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,395
Hey, it's my guys!
My guys!

324
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:13,194
2 drinks.
Amazing.

325
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,658
Hey, get these guys a drink.

326
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,322
Because this lady right here,

327
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:20,638
this lady's like the coolest
lady in the whole world.

328
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:24,439
And this unattractive
lady is my ex-husband.

329
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:29,394
I am so happy right now.

330
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,340
OK, I'm gonna need you to
support her while I get the door, OK?

331
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,457
Whoa! She's 100 pounds
of jell-o shots right now.

332
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,473
Oh, you're so super sweet.

333
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,226
I totally weigh more than 100 pounds.

334
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:45,193
Watch out. She's a kisser
when she's drunk. She kisses.

335
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:47,472
I already got a mouthful on the way out.

336
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,909
I never kissed a black man before,
but I will again.

337
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:00,574
Yeah. Put her in the seat, OK?
Careful.

338
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:04,161
All right, would you do me a favor
and go upstairs and get some aspirin,

339
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,734
some B-12,
and get her cowboy sweatshirt.

340
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,842
- When she's drunk, she gets cold.
- Sure.

341
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,295
I'm so hungry.

342
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,904
You know what?
I'm gonna make a bundt cake.

343
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:20,384
Sorry I acted so crazy today.

344
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,693
I was just so afraid that
Allison was gonna say something

345
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:25,102
to you that would chang
the way that you looked at me.

346
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:28,012
Right now I'm looking
at a man who's generous enough

347
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:31,003
to help a woman who drives him crazy
99% of the time.

348
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,317
I think it's sweet.

349
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,695
Hey, you know what else is good?

350
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,119
Cinnabun.

351
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:40,892
You go get it.
I'm gonna wait right here.

352
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:43,100
Let me, let me put you to bed.

353
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,918
Now, Allison, let me come on.
All right.

354
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,880
Let me just lay here.
Can I lay here? Just let me lay here.

355
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,223
It's so cool.

356
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:56,215
I love marble.

357
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,482
You know, I wanted spanish tile,

358
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:03,248
but you said marble, Gary.
You are so smart.

359
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,142
You are so smart.

360
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:08,397
It's hard being smart, isn't it?

361
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,294
I'm always the smart one,
Gary, and you're always the fun one.

362
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:15,973
And I used to be fun like Vanessa,
but then I met you.

363
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:21,121
And you outfunned
me and I just got boring.

364
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,268
I didn't out fun you. It's just...

365
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,356
You married an immature Jerk,

366
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,909
and somebody had to step
up and act like a grownup.

367
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:33,081
I used to love that immature Jerk.
Don't talk about him like that.

368
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,404
It's a deal.
But you take it easy on yourself, OK,

369
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,928
because you were a lot of things,
but you were never boring.

370
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:45,165
I would kiss you right now
if I hadn't just thrown up in my mouth.

371
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,980
All right, ladies, let's go get 'em.
Let's go, go!

372
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,253
All right!

373
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,279
- Hey, Ref, what's up?
- You and Vanessa work things out?

374
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,112
Yes, we did.
Thank you for your advice, OK?

375
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:05,016
You be good to her.

376
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:09,577
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!

377
00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:11,917
How you feeling, Allison?

378
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,795
Looks like Vanessa really
did bring out your fun side.

379
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:18,999
Well, if by fun side
you mean my insides, then yes.

380
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,013
Yes, she did.

381
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,511
Let's play some hoops, ladies.

382
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,439
Hey, you know what?
I bought these in bulk, so.

383
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,192
