1
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:05,286
Kids, wake up! Oh, my gosh!
I overslept! Guys!

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:09,348
I overslept! If I ever meet the guy
that invented the snooze alarm,

3
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:11,942
i'm gonna slap him in
the face every 5 minutes.

4
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:15,612
Come on, you guys. Come on, hurry up! We
don't want to keep your mother waiting.

5
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:18,203
So. So, that, concludes our

6
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:20,895
drill on what to do in case
we ever oversleep. So...

7
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:24,106
Just go back into your rooms
and put your school clothes on.

8
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:26,445
Don't keep your mother waiting.
That's good. Come on, guys.

9
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:29,026
You know, dad, I'm tired of
being woken up like a fireman,

10
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,711
without the thrill of the job.

11
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:35,180
Come on, We'll be out of here in 5 min.
I'll pop in some toaster waffles.

12
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:37,918
- Don't make a big thing about it, OK?
- Don't make a big thing about it?

13
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,547
Why are you suddenly acting like
the woman I wish I'd married?

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,305
We'd better not be late. I'm the tardy
officer. How would that look?

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,348
Hey, why don't you set your alarm,
Louise?

16
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:49,402
And then you can wake me up every day.

17
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:53,118
For the same reason I'm not going
to give myself away at my wedding:

18
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,555
because it's not my job.

19
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:59,520
Hey, Tom, honey, don't forget to
bring some nice clothes tonight.

20
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:01,632
I can't believe you're still
making me do that, mom.

21
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:02,474
Do what?

22
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:04,677
Mom told the new neighbors
I would ask their friendless

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,408
- daughter to the school dance tonight.
- Come on, Tommy, be nice.

24
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:10,462
Be nice. They just moved in. It wouldn't
hurt you to introduce Marjorie

25
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,425
to the people she'll be
going to school with.

26
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:14,482
Fine. But we are officially even.

27
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:18,051
After this, I don't ever want to hear
about how my big head ruined your body.

28
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:24,887
What's going on around here?

29
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,461
I mean, you're being nice,
you're cleaning up for no reason.

30
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,493
What's, my gosh,
the doctor called, I have cancer.

31
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:32,383
Is it in my head or in my butt?

32
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,874
Can't I just be nice
and easygoing for no reason?

33
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,504
Based on my 15 years of research, no.

34
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:43,838
Don't run the dishwasher. It's broken.
What's going on with you?

35
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:47,552
Walter and I may 16.

36
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:52,819
- That's great! Allison, that's great!
- I know. Isn't it? I'm getting married.

37
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:56,448
No more Allison money!
No more alimony?

38
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:59,322
Hey, maybe that's where they got
the word "alimony" from.

39
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,712
- Allison money. Alimony.
- What?

40
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:05,943
- Allison money. Alimony.
- It is exciting though. I mean, really.

41
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,970
I feel like I finally know
where my life is headed.

42
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,095
I feel like I just passed a 120-pound
Kidney Stone that says she's 110.

43
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,866
You know, I wonder what it's
gonna be like to be married

44
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,680
to a man who doesn't smell
his q-tips after he uses them.

45
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,392
- Come on, Louise! You guys ready?
- Yep! Let's go!

46
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,668
I got to get going.
I have to be in long beach by 9:00.

47
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:29,130
What a happy day.

48
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:33,649
Remember in "the wizard of oz"
when the movie went from black and white

49
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:34,895
to technicolor?

50
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,532
I don't know how they did that.

51
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,256
- I am so sorry.
- "Don't start the dishwasher."

52
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:01,320
There's really only one way to
screw up those instructions.

56
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:12,379
I am so sorry, Gary.
What. What is this?

57
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:16,144
Well, remember my dad gave me that
newspaper when man landed on the moon

58
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,758
and you told me it would never be worth
anything? Well, now you're right.

59
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,049
- So, how bad was it?
- How bad was it?

60
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:25,291
Are you kidding me?

61
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:27,080
The water ran for 7 straight hours.

62
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,695
Every floorboard buckled.
The neighbors gathered around the house.

63
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:32,401
They thought the house was weeping
and it was a miracle from god!

64
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:35,287
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gary.
I am so sorry.

65
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,257
Stop saying you're sorry.
You sound like me when we were married.

66
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:41,452
You sure you want me to stay here?
Well... tch!

67
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,763
I don't want you to stay here,
but after what I did,

68
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:45,726
I can't make you go to a hotel,
because you...

69
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,920
- You'll hold that over my head forever.
- Forever.

70
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:51,604
Right, so... I... i got you,

71
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,912
some beer.
And I'm gonna make you a steak.

72
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:57,098
And I insist that you stay
in the master bedroom.

73
00:03:57,222 --> 00:04:00,655
Oh, my old bedroom.
Great, you know. That'll be like...

74
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,521
It'll be like when they show a prisoner
the cell he lived in for 15 years.

75
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,543
- Hey, dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.

76
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,843
Louise, honey? Your dad is gonna
be staying with us for a couple days.

77
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,931
And I don't want it to
be confusing, but...

78
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:19,327
Your father and I are not getting back
together, OK? In a few days,

79
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,492
everything'll go back to the way it was
before, but, you know, not "before" when

80
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:25,101
we were married "before,"
before the flood "before."

81
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,493
I wasn't confused until you
tried to explain it that way.

82
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,721
Yeah. I'm with Louise. I'm...
We're not back together, right?

83
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,496
Right. Yeah.

84
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,524
Hey, son,
when you leaving for the big dance?

85
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,947
As soon as Cowzilla rips
the roof off and plucks me out.

86
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:50,697
That's a lousy attitude Tommy. You don't
even know what this girl looks like.

87
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,739
Yeah I know, but it's just not fair,
dad. Mom should have asked me first.

88
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:55,735
What's the big deal?
You take her to the dance,

89
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:58,214
you stiff-arm her through
a couple of numbers, you

90
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,978
let her graze over the buffet and fill
her 4 stomachs, and you bring her home.

91
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,189
- She's here. She's here!
- How bad is it?

92
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,903
OK. Look. Try not to stare.

93
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:22,153
- Hi, Marjorie. How are you?
- Nice to meet you, mr. Brooks.

94
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,072
It's nice to meet you. Come on in, OK?

95
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:37,877
I'm gonna say something now.

96
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,099
That may have been it.

97
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,312
Hi, Marjorie. Look at you.
You look so pretty. I love that dress.

98
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:49,151
Isn't that a pretty dress, Tom?

99
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:53,467
You know, thanks for doing this, Tom.

100
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,853
Total drag taking out
the new girl, right?

101
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:59,624
Hey, at one time or another,
we've all been the new girl.

102
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,437
You know what? Honey, hair is starting
to fall in the back. Let me help you.

103
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:12,034
Let me. Let me talk to you.
Tom, Let's go. Come on.

104
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:20,045
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

105
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,982
My heart's beating so fast,
my tie is moving.

106
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,859
All right, look. OK.
Here's some money. OK?

107
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,928
OK. Do I give it to her
now or when we come home?

108
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,380
That's for snacks at the dance.

109
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,850
Sorry. I'm just...
just a little nervous, you know?

110
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:40,220
It's a pocket. OK. You all right?

111
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,077
Let me help calm your fears
a little here, OK?

112
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:47,087
You don't have to change the oil
in your car every 3,000 miles.

113
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:50,110
It's OK to do it every 5,000 miles.
That's fine.

114
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,104
What does that have to do with my date?

115
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,613
Nothing. I'm just trying to get
your head out of it, OK? Let's go.

116
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,045
Hey, Tom, come on.
Marjorie's mom's waiting.

117
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:06,912
Nice to see you, mrs. Brooks.
Nice to meet you, mr. Brooks.

118
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,004
Let's go, Tom.

119
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:14,113
I just want to let you know that
I am completely unprepared for this

120
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,475
and I blame both of you.

121
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,126
Are you aware that Tom just left
the house with a grown woman?

122
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:24,299
She's 15, Walter.

123
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,993
Was she sent from some
Island to protect mankind?

124
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:32,588
She and her family just
moved here from iowa.

125
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,839
Of course. Corn.

126
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,593
Congratulations taking over
the reins of team Allison.

127
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:43,713
Yeah. I hope you do a better job with
the franchise than I ever did? Come on!

128
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,199
Can we just settle for a high-five,
whatever it is your people do?

129
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,099
I brought over the cds of the potential
wedding bands you asked for.

130
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,693
We got Dixieland, Disco...

131
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,644
I even threw in some Country-Western
for the Texas Krandalls.

132
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,995
The texas Krandalls.
So when they say, "rember the alamo,"

133
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,585
you do.

134
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,556
Very funny, Gary.

135
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:12,193
I rember that joke fondly the next time
I'm lying on top of your former wife.

136
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,306
I'm gonna go put my bag
in your room, OK, Allison?

137
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,485
Wait a minute.
Why is he going to your bedroom?

138
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,141
I flooded his house.
The least I can do is

139
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,849
put him up for a couple days
and let him sleep in the master bedroom.

140
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:28,256
- And you'll be sleeping...
- In the guest bedroom.

141
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:31,801
Walter, wait a minute.
You're not jealous, are you?

142
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:32,874
Of Gary?

143
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:37,858
How long is he gonna be staying?

144
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:40,640
Allison. I forgot to tell you,
I might have exaggerated

145
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,220
a little bit with this girl
that works down at the coffee shop.

146
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:46,895
So if the phone rings, please answer,
"senator Brooks'office."

147
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:51,139
Two days, tops.

148
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,565
So, I'll see you tomorrow at school?

149
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,599
Promise me you're gonna have lunch
with me. I don't want to eat by myself.

150
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:08,504
Tomorrow's meatloaf day,
so I'll bring a Beaujolais.

151
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,550
- Dad! Dad!
- Hey, son, how are you?

152
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,934
Well, I think it's safe to say
that I'm in really over my head here.

153
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,307
Why, what happened?

154
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,656
I don't know if you've noticed or not,
but Marjorie's kind of hot.

155
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:33,357
The law doesn't really let me have
this conversation with you, but...

156
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,142
I understand the words you're saying.

157
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,099
I mean, we were the center
of attention all night,

158
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:41,041
and people were staring
and snapping pictures.

159
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:43,235
And then the coach slapped
on the shoulder and told me

160
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,297
he can use someone like me on defense.

161
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,789
I'm starting next week, and I don't
even know what sport I'm playing.

162
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,285
All right. Calm down.

163
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,705
When you're with a girl like Marjorie,
you're gonna draw a lot of attention?

164
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:57,453
All right. It's like driving a Ferrari?

165
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:00,585
When you're next to something
that's sleek and beautiful.

166
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,991
Again, I have to go with the car
metaphor for legal purposes.

167
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,025
People are gonna notice, you know?

168
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,388
I don't think I can handle that.

169
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,524
You know,
I'm an under-the-radar kind of guy.

170
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:16,136
Didn't a part of you
tonight like that attention?

171
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:18,893
Come on. Let me hear it. You liked it.

172
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,304
Yes. OK? I loved it. I felt like a god!

173
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,998
You felt like a god! Yes! All right!

174
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:27,122
Now go upstairs and put on
your pajamas and get ready for bed.

175
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,631
And tomorrow,
you sit with her at lunchtime,

176
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,918
and you're gonna be
the coolest guy in school.

177
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,510
You know,
I'm finally cooler than Randy Wilcox.

178
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,469
And he brought his own
son to health class.

179
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,063
Hey, Roomie. You know I forgot
how much I loved living here?

180
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:46,729
Gary, did you shave in
the kitchen sink a while ago?

181
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,623
Yes, I did. Don't worry, though.
It was mostly my face.

182
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:53,081
What are you doing?

183
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:55,503
I'm planning a wedding, Gary,
and I'm on hold with a realtor.

184
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:58,192
I'm thinking about selling
the house once I move in with Walter.

185
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:01,676
It's Allison Brooks. I spoke with
you last week. I have this wonder...

186
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,815
Yeah, and we saw your ad
on the bus bench. Very nice smile.

187
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,275
- You can't sell our house.
- No, but I can sell my house.

188
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,087
No. In this economy? You'd be crazy.
Let me rent it from you.

189
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:14,330
OK. What?

190
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,797
You don't want to uproot the kids.
They live in the house.

191
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,569
They have all these
great memories here.

192
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:21,055
Think of all the dead pets
buried in the backyard.

193
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,093
You know? Some family comes in,

194
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:25,957
they want to put in a pool, they start
digging. Next thing you know, there's

195
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:28,999
a hamster with a badge
asking a lot of questions.

196
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,316
I... i don't know. I mean, Gary,
I would be your landlord.

197
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,423
Yes, you would. You'd be my landlord,
and if I fell behind on the rent,

198
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:38,665
you could just throw
me out in the dead of winter.

199
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:41,361
- You would love that.
- I would love that.

200
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:43,949
It's perfect! So? So?

201
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:46,746
OK. Yeah, you can rent my house.

202
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,934
Jessica, i'm back!

203
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:55,453
You named our house "Jessica"?

204
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:58,739
When you're in prison, you get lonely,
Allison. You start to name stuff.

205
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,807
This is perfect. It's just
like old times. Except good.

206
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,570
Allison, your llama got loose.

207
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,855
What are you doing out there?

208
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:20,821
When I was here earlier,
I think I left my keys.

209
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,135
Yeah, there they are,
right where I left them.

210
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:25,951
So, what are you two doing?

211
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:29,278
Well, I am planning a wedding,
Gary is bothering me,

212
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:31,560
and you're obviously here
because you're jealous.

213
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:35,169
All right, so what if I am? I think it's
inappropriate that Gary is staying here.

214
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,664
There are hotels and hostels.
I could even make room at my place.

215
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,034
There's a pull-out
couch in the train room.

216
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:45,002
You know, Walter,
I don't like this side of you.

217
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,504
We're getting married,
and then you don't even trust me?

218
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:50,242
- I mean, what does that say about us?
- Wait a min, you two. Knock it off

219
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,881
OK? Let's just slow things
down for a second here.

220
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:55,134
Krandall has a train room?

221
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:59,944
But I know what this is.
It's just pre-wedding jitters, OK?

222
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,023
Let's not lose sight of
what's important here, OK?

223
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,278
And that is me moving out of
my dump and moving back here, OK?

224
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,189
Walter, you know how I feel about Gary.

225
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,469
I mean, I would not sleep with
Gary if it would save his life.

226
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:14,681
Which, by the way,

227
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:17,503
I think that was the way he tricked
me into doing it the first time.

228
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,359
All I said was,
I didn't know how much time I had left.

229
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,997
- And in all fairness, do any of us?
- Yeah. Well...

230
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:26,659
if I was planning on sleeping with Gary,

231
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:29,181
I would express my disgust
as vigorously as you just did.

232
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:32,872
Oh, my god. I can't believe
you are acting so irrational.

233
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:34,649
I can't deal with this right now.

234
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,294
I'm gonna run a bath,
take a sleeping pill, and go to bed.

235
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,779
If we wind up sleeping together,
you should know

236
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,561
I'm a man that likes to be held.

237
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:50,057
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

238
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:55,728
Mango.

239
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:02,004
Bear claw?

240
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,411
Walter, what...
What are you doing here?

241
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,909
I came over with a box
of apology bear claws.

242
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,201
The question is,
what are you two doing here?

243
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,283
Yeah. Gary, what are you doing here?

244
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:16,896
You told me to sleep in here!
What are you doing here?

245
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,956
I don't know.
I took a sleeping pill.

246
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:21,758
I just I must have, you know,
stumbled in here by accident.

247
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:24,806
- Why were you spooning me?
- Why were you backing up into me?

248
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:27,425
Hey. You know what?
When you get spooned, you back in.

249
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,089
That's the way I was raised.

250
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,633
And to think you accused
me of being overly jealous.

251
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,990
What, were you just...
You just walked into my house?

252
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:40,671
- You're in bed with another man.
- Please. It's not a man. It's Gary.

253
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:41,755
Exactly!

254
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:45,864
She's right, Krandall. Nothing happened.
It was just like when we were married.

255
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,532
Mom, where...

256
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:52,867
- What is everybody doing in here?
- Bear claw, Louise?

257
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:56,004
- Can i, mom?
- Yeah, grab one for your brother.

258
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,556
Thank you, dr. Krandall.
Our ride to school is here.

259
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,000
Have a great day.

260
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,107
Tommy, I have no clue what's going on in
here, but we get sugar for breakfast!

261
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,687
Remember, honey,
family stuff is private!

262
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:13,459
Look. Walter, I know what this must
look like, but you have to believe us.

263
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:14,695
This was an accident.

264
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,157
I know exactly what it looks like,
and it was no accident.

265
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,419
Wait a minute.
Don't throw away your marriage

266
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:21,564
with Allison. And most importantly,

267
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,536
you're gonna blow my shot at
getting back together with Jessica.

268
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:29,848
- Who is Jessica?
- It's the name he calls the house.

269
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,663
It's a prison thing.

270
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,753
I'm sorry to disappoint you and Jessica,
but there isn't gonna be a wedding.

271
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,372
Allison clearly isn't
ready to be my wife.

272
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:41,457
Walter, wait a minute!
You can't leave like this!

273
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,476
I believe I can, and I will!

274
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:48,007
My god, walter fell down the stairs!

275
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,595
Jessica, what have you done?

276
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,707
Walter, are you all right?

277
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,248
No, I'm fine.
I've never been good at storming out.

278
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,801
I have small feet
and a high center of gravity.

279
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,995
Excellent save on the bear claws,
Krandall.

280
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,319
Here, let me. Let me help you up.

281
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:06,962
No, leave me alone.
I'm gonna sit here and say my piece.

282
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:11,183
OK. Look. Walter, why would you
say I don't want to get married?

283
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,975
Because every one of your actions,
starting with flooding Gary's house,

284
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,932
is explainable on a subconscious level.
May I elaborate?

285
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,566
No. I don't think it's good
to elaborate after a fall.

286
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,011
Gary, come on. Walter, go on.

287
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,251
Gary told you not to run the dishwasher,
yet you did,

288
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,215
knowing it would flood his house
and he'd need a place to stay.

289
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,872
You're saying I did all
this deliberately just

290
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:34,418
so I could get him over here
and get into bed with him?

291
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,887
- Exactly.
- You're wrong.

292
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,441
The only reason Allison flooded
my house is because she lives

293
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,930
to make my life miserable,
and the only reason i'm here

294
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:44,278
is so she can make my life
miserable and save on gas.

295
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:50,557
No. Walter's right. I did this all
subconsciously knowing that Walter

296
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,999
was so jealous that if he
caught us in bed together, he would

297
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,822
call off the wedding.
God, it was all so deliberate.

298
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:58,645
Right down to the sleeping pills.

299
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,113
What is this,
an old episode of "quincy"?

300
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,531
You can say it, Mango.
You're not ready to get married.

301
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:09,312
No. No, don't say it, Mango.

302
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,238
- Don't say it.
- No, he's right.

303
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:14,174
I don't want to get married.

304
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,238
Sure, you do! Yes, you do!
Look how handsome this guy is.

305
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:20,000
You love him, he loves you,
and he's just.

306
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,014
He's two titanium hips away
from walking down the aisle.

307
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:31,002
It's like our whole relationship
was just a reaction

308
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,249
to my marriage with Gary, wasn't it?

309
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:35,514
Kiss her, Krandall. Kiss your woman.

310
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:39,027
Walter, you are a loving

311
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:42,735
and kind man, but I cannot marry
you just because you're, like,

312
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,734
the complete opposite of Gary.

313
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,846
I understand, Mango.

314
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:49,752
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't heartbroken.

315
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,948
But I'm gonna let you go,
and I'm gonna do it with dignity.

316
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:03,546
Starting now.

317
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,195
Cranberry, I'm gonna get you some ice.

318
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,650
Gary, would you help this wonderful,
sweet man to the sofa?

319
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:18,154
- Man, I can't believe it.
- No, I'm afraid she's gone, Gary.

320
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,728
This is where they've been
sending my "sports illustrated."

321
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:31,610
The baseball cards are done.

322
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,327
Well, let's see them. Let's see them.
What have we got? Harmon killebrew.

323
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,555
He's hot.

324
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:42,647
For what it's worth, you know,

325
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,599
i'm sorry you couldn't move
back into your old place. But, hey,

326
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:49,162
at least Allison didn't marry a guy
she wasn't in love with?

327
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:51,569
You see my crockpot?
It's over there.

328
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,644
Hey, dad. Hey, Dennis.

329
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:04,015
Your dad tells me you're
driving a Ferrari.

330
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:10,174
- I was driving a Ferrari. Was.
- What do you mean, was?

331
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:12,514
We were sitting outside
the lunchroom, and

332
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:15,889
I went inside to grab some milk, and...
she's gone.

333
00:20:16,977 --> 00:20:18,794
Couldn't have been more than 30 seconds.

334
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:24,880
Whoever took her must have
known what he was doing.

335
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:28,599
You know, I never had to worry
about that with my old girlfriend.

336
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,328
I could leave Danielle anywhere.

337
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,046
You could leave my wife
on the front lawn with her robe open,

338
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:35,464
no one would take her.

339
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:40,733
Look. Son,
it's better to have driven a Ferrari

340
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,266
and lost than to have
never driven a Ferrari.

341
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:52,214
It's Danielle.
Looks like I'm back to riding the bus.

342
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,112
