1
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:03,023
Oh, my gosh.
That was incredible.

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:05,792
Hey, sorry about the buttons
on your blouse.

3
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:07,894
I just got a little
frustrated and ripped
them off.

4
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:09,962
That's all right.

5
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:13,481
Don't worry about it.
It was only...Prada.

6
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:16,502
But the one thing
that was confusing

7
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:20,756
Was what was that list of guys'
names you kept repeating?

8
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:27,985
That was the lineup for 1988
dodgers. It--it helps me.

9
00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:33,440
So, did it live up
to all your expectations?

10
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:36,927
You kidding me? It lived up
to expectations I didn't
know that I had.

11
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:40,262
Holy smokes.
It was thrilling.
It was super hot.

12
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:42,318
At one point
it was really scary.

13
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:45,449
Sorry.
I was a trained gymnast.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,369
If I could just get some
chalk on my hands I could

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,953
[knuckles crack]
really show you something.

16
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:52,413
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

17
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:55,271
So, what happens now?

18
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:58,128
I mean, I've never dated
anyone from work before.

19
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,636
Do we drive in together
tomorrow?

20
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:02,825
I don't think so.
I think we should probably
keep work work,

21
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:05,045
And this this.
Like, keep it separate.

22
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:07,625
Ok. So, when we're at work,
we don't tell anyone.

23
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:10,075
And I'm your boss.
And you're my employee.

24
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:12,453
When you say that
it sounds really hot.

25
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:15,403
Maybe we should do it again,
I don't have any chalk

26
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:17,017
But I could probably find
some baby powder.

28
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,450
Curtis: Lunch is here.

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,985
Kfc?

30
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:31,756
Mm-hmm.
New fiery grill wings, yo!

31
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:34,296
Be careful, man.
These things are hot.

32
00:01:34,297 --> 00:01:37,603
I had one in the car,
felt like I was sucking
on a blowtorch.

33
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:38,738
Whoo!

34
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,610
Let me try one of these
bad boys right here.

35
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,879
Can't be that hot.

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,521
Yeah. That's not that hot.

37
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,926
Oh, my god!

38
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:51,066
Aah! That's hot coffee!

39
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,570
Aah!

40
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,806
What the hell is that?!

41
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:55,242
It's a bloody mary.

42
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,884
What?! It's 5:00 someplace!

43
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:01,757
Hey, curtis.

44
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:04,363
Hello, gary.

45
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:09,408
Brooks. Nice to see
you in the workplace.

46
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:14,017
Hello, sasha. Nice to see you.
You look very nice.

47
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,085
Why, thank you.

48
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:16,554
Oh, not at all.

49
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,958
You guys are doing it.

50
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,659
What?!

51
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,895
What gives you that idea?

52
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,329
Because you guys
are talking like you're
in victorian England.

53
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,398
[british accent]
uh, sasha, nice to see you.

54
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:35,400
I find myself captivated
by your charms.

55
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,067
I pray you don't
get cholera.

56
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,102
All right!

57
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,536
Just don't tell anybody, ok?
Just keep it a secret.

58
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,304
We don't want everyone
to start gossiping.

59
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:45,739
Especially hannah in ad sales.
You know, gossip--

60
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,674
That's like heroin
to that lady.

61
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:52,810
Actually, I think
that heroin is like
heroin to hannah.

62
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,444
Ok. I'm gonna get
some plates.

63
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:58,647
Oh, plates. No. Sweetheart,
these are fiery wings.

64
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,416
These are meant
to be eaten out of a bucket,
like a real man.

65
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,817
All the same, I think I would
like to take it into my office

66
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,318
And eat it like a lady.

67
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,787
Eat it like a lady? What?
With knife and fork.

68
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:08,987
No, like shoving it
into my face

69
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,356
Until I feel like I've
punished my mom enough!

70
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:16,025
Well, somebody picked
the right time to start
sleeping with the boss.

71
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,260
Oh, what are you talking about?

72
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,261
You didn't hear?

73
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:19,829
The latest ratings book
just came in,

74
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,730
And she's talking about
changing things--

75
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,398
Extending shows,
cutting shows.

76
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,631
But you're going to be safe.

77
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:27,133
Look. Sasha's the boss.
I'm just an employee.

78
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,834
She controls what happens
in the workplace.

79
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,535
She's going to add shows
that she wants.

80
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,405
She's going to cut shows
that she doesn't want to do.

81
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:35,642
She's the boss.
She's going to do whatever
she wants. It's her choice.

82
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,010
And it has nothing to do
with the fact

83
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,780
That she's scored
a 10 on my pommel horse
last night.

84
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:48,421
So, tom, how are things
going at my little boy's
very first job?

85
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:50,057
Huh? You like working
at hogie moe's?

86
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:51,392
No. I wanna quit.

87
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:52,928
What?!

88
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:55,463
That's told me I'd be in charge
of urinal cakes and lettuce.

89
00:03:55,464 --> 00:04:00,299
Ok. Please tell me
they have a "lava las manos"
sign in the bathroom?

90
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,168
I don't know. But there's
this really sad poem
in one of stalls

91
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,472
About a guy who's brokenhearted.

92
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:05,841
See he came there--

93
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:09,179
No! I know it.
I know the poem, tom.

94
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,214
Look, I know it may not be
the most fulfilling job
in the world,

95
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:14,649
But I think it's important
we learned to stick
with things.

96
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,418
It's easy for you to get
excited. You're starting
a job you've always wanted.

97
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,721
That's true. Working
for the dean of psychology
at ucla--

98
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:22,923
You know, it didn't just
fall into my lap.

99
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,959
They had my resume there
for over a year and a half
before they called.

100
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,994
And you know what?
Before that I had to work
a lot degrading jobs.

101
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,062
I waited tables.
I bartended.

102
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,763
I was married to your
father for 15 years.

103
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:35,731
Yeah. That wasn't a paying job.

104
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,966
It is now.

105
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,100
[car horn]

106
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:41,536
Oh, there's your dad.
Go get your books, ok?

107
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,143
Hello, allison. How are you?

108
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:49,410
Ok. What's with you?

109
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:50,645
What do you mean,
"what's with me?"

110
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:51,712
You're in a good mood.

111
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,147
Your cheeks are all flushed.

112
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:55,849
So, they're either remaking
"porky's" or--

113
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,851
Ooh, you had sex.

114
00:04:57,852 --> 00:05:02,687
Well, it is true.
Sasha and I did make love.

115
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,522
But what? Are they really
remaking "porky's?"

116
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:06,223
No. No.
No, gary. No.

117
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,624
Really? You're not
at all afraid

118
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,226
About how sex is going
to affect you two
working together?

119
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,694
Oh, no.

120
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:13,662
Sasha and I, we both agreed
to keep it professional.

121
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:16,563
Plus, I read a very interesting
article in "the new yorker"

122
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:21,233
That said office romances are
actually common these days.

123
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,968
Ok. A) no, you didn't.

124
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:27,372
And um, b) my guess is
you fell asleep during
a laker game

125
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:29,574
And woke up during
a dr. Phil re-run.

126
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,477
Gary, sex changes everything.

127
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,045
I mean, it makes everything
personal.

128
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:36,513
Think about the first time
we did it.

129
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:38,515
Uh, us having sex
changed nothing.

130
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:42,385
I went from thinking
you were slutty
to knowing you were slutty.

131
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:43,986
Everybody knew that.

132
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:46,488
When you're slutty,
word tends to get around.

133
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,892
Sasha: Ok. Next thing.

134
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,761
Since our kppq family
is growing,

135
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:56,029
We're running a little
short on parking spaces.

136
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,399
So, are there any volunteers
to park in the lot
across the street?

137
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,968
I'm fine with parking across
the street.

138
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,236
There's no reason why I should
have a special spot.

139
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:09,005
Thank you, gary,
for being a good
team member.

140
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:13,510
Hey, you know what?
I'm doing what any other
team member would do.

141
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:17,313
And last order of business--
this is a little tough.

142
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:21,650
We will be extending sue
the cat lady's show
"dramatic paws"

143
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,286
To 2 hours
instead of just one.

144
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:28,823
Based on some
very and somewhat
inexplicable ratings.

145
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,191
What's the matter?
An hour wasn't enough time

146
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,326
For her to do all
her stupid cat puns?!

147
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:35,963
Have a mice day!

148
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:38,165
Hope you're feline-ing great!

149
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,435
And since extending her show
will cut into the show
that comes before,

150
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:45,304
We will be cutting
"the score" with gary brooks
down to an hour.

151
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,505
Wait? What?!

152
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,240
Gary, I'm sorry.
It's purely a ratings thing.

153
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,841
But my show gets
really good ratings.

154
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:52,676
Yes, it does. But it's new.

155
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,211
And you're still building
an audience.

156
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,679
How am I supposed to build
an audience if you cut
my show in half?

157
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,014
Gary, it's nothing personal.

158
00:06:58,015 --> 00:06:59,382
What do you mean
it's not personal?!

159
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:01,616
I'm your boyfriend.
We're sleeping together.

160
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:02,984
Gary!

161
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:06,287
Come on! Who here doesn't know
that these 2 are doing it?

162
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:12,025
My bad.

163
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:18,030
Yes, professor drakely.
It's just that when
I started this job,

164
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:21,433
I thought I'd be using more
of my psychology expertise

165
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,201
As opposed to running errands
for you.

166
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:26,271
See, I graduated
top of my class at uc irvine.

167
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:28,272
Uh huh.

168
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:29,507
Uh huh.

169
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:33,944
Uh, yeah ok. So fong's cleaners
on santa monica?

170
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,946
Ok. Ready at 3.

171
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:37,348
Uh, you know what?
Yeah.

172
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,752
I am crushing up your
cialis pills right now.

173
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,787
Yeah. Ok. Bye.

174
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:43,954
Hi, mom.
Hey, honey.

175
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,522
How was your day
at hogie moe's?

176
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,323
You still thinking
about quitting?

177
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,491
I mean, you were right.
I just stuck with it.

178
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:50,125
And I'm having
a great time.

179
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:53,392
Hey, this kid threw out
his retainer when he dumped
his tray into the trash.

180
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:54,392
And guess who dug it out?

181
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,528
Me. And then my boss told me
I was a hero.

182
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,029
And I made a joke about
a hero sandwich,

183
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,397
And like 4 people laughed.
It was awesome.

184
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:03,133
Honey, that is so great.

185
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,301
You know it must be nice
to feel so productive.

186
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:07,704
Yeah. You know,
I'm loving being part
of the hogie family.

187
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,605
That's what we call it.

188
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,306
So, how's your job?

189
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,308
Actually I worked
with a particularly
interesting case today--

190
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,911
Borderline narcissist
who feels the need
to dominate women.

191
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:21,514
Probably due to his
repressed homosexuality.

192
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,916
Really? Did you help him?

193
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:27,086
Yeah. Yeah. But if my help
lasts for more than 4 hours,

194
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:30,222
He's supposed to consult
a physician.

195
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,492
Sasha: What are you doing?

196
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,128
Well, just dotting down notes
for my show.

197
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,531
Wow. Want to not do that
and do something else?

198
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,666
No, I don't think so.
I'm really not in the mood. Ok?

199
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,001
What do you mean you're
not in the mood?

200
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,136
You're always in the mood.

201
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:47,370
The other day you started
making out with me

202
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:49,705
When we were watching
"intervention."

203
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:54,043
And I never found out
if janine the ice skater
got off meth.

204
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:57,312
Uh, she didn't.
She relapsed and then her dad
killed himself.

205
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,880
I was in the mood then,
I'm just not in the mood now.

206
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:00,348
I'm not feeling it. Sorry.

207
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,784
Is this about today?

208
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,451
What--of course not.
No, come on.

209
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,753
I have work to do.
Since my show is only an hour,

210
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,421
I have to cut some stuff out
for time, you know.

211
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:11,656
Ha ha--that would have been
hilarious.

212
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:12,890
It's gone now.

213
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,662
Ha ha!

214
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:20,299
That's a classic
that no one will ever hear.

215
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,402
Gary, I'm sorry.
It was a business decision.

216
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:25,637
Look, your girlfriend
hates that it happened,

217
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:27,271
But your boss had to do it.

218
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:30,240
Hey, you know what?
You could have shortened
anyone's show,

219
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,976
And you chose to shorten mine.
I don't get it.

220
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:35,545
Why not shorten the show
with that old man that talks
about pots and pans?

221
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:36,713
Antique bob?

222
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:39,015
Do you know how much
revenue he brings in

223
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,617
With those adult diaper ads?

224
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:45,086
Our station depends on him.

225
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:47,988
Gary, I don't understand.

226
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:51,991
You are the one who said
we should keep work
and dating separate.

227
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,492
This does not seem separate.

228
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,660
Of course
it doesn't seem separate.

229
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,294
I'm so mad at my boss right now,

230
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,064
That I don't even want to play
with my girlfriend's boobs.

231
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,633
So, what? Are you saying
I should give you
special treatment

232
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,767
Because we're dating?

233
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,602
Yeah. That's awesome.

234
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:07,237
I can't do that.

235
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,871
Well, then I don't know
what to do.

236
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:10,873
You know, I'm afraid that what
we have is going to get ruined

237
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,341
Because we work together.

238
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,576
So, I'm going to have to choose
what's more important to me.

239
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:16,111
So, you know what?

240
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:18,380
Fine I'll choose.

241
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,985
Gary, that is very romantic.

242
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:26,821
But I don't think you should
quit your job over this.

243
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:32,759
What are you talking about?

244
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,328
What--you're choosing me,
right?

245
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:40,331
If by me you mean my job, yes.

246
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,932
You know what?
I think I'm going
to head home.

247
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,701
Ah, sasha, come on.
What am I supposed to do?

248
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,102
It's my dream job!

249
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,972
Oh, I don't expect you
to do anything.

250
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:52,373
I just hope you don't end up
regretting your decision.

251
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,107
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

252
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,506
No. No. No. That would be
letting my personal feelings

253
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,008
Dictate my business
decisions.

254
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,842
And I am a professional.

255
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,209
So, I will see you
at work tomorrow.

256
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,310
Don't forget
it's casual Friday.

257
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:11,830
Glad you could join me.
We're back from break
in like a minute.

258
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,862
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

259
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:14,697
Sasha arranged
for a chiropractor
to come in a work on us.

260
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:19,067
I got an adjustment called
a cox flexion distraction.

261
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:22,471
And at first it sounded like
something I definitely
did not want.

262
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:25,673
But now I want as much
cox flexion as I can get.

263
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,074
Ooh.

264
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,375
Can we please get to work?!

265
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:30,510
Ok. Someone's
a little uptight today, huh?

266
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,978
Sorry. I'm very uptight.
Sasha and I had a huge fight.

267
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,280
I basically had to choose
between her and work.

268
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:36,280
And you picked the job?!

269
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,481
Yes, I did.

270
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:41,251
Are you crazy?!
You always pick the girl!

271
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:44,554
Remember that movie
where richard gere went
back into the factory

272
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:49,191
And he picked up debra
winger and all those homely
left-behinds were clapping.

273
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,826
What if he hadn't?

274
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:51,927
If he hadn't,
it wouldn't be

275
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,228
"an officer
and a gentleman."

276
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,863
It would be
"an officer and
a selfish bastard."

277
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,168
You're on.

278
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,269
Hey, welcome back
to "the score"
with gary brooks.

279
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,372
You know there's a lot
of talk about football
dynasties, all right.

280
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:08,910
Patriots, steelers,
you know what I want to do.

281
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,679
I want to take it
in another direction today.

282
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,216
Let's talk about
the dynasties of failure.

283
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,684
I mean the real losers.

284
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:17,755
The detroit lions,
they gotta be at the top
of that list right away.

285
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:21,659
You also have your cleveland
browns. These poor guys,
they can't win on the road.

286
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,561
They can't win
when they go back to cleavage.

287
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:24,963
Cleveland.

288
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:27,265
What are you doing in here?

289
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,800
Oh, sorry.
I just left some paperwork.

290
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,936
Yeah. Even your newest
franchises in the nfl,
they win more.

291
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:36,739
You got your jacksonville
jaguars, your tennessee titans.

292
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,042
They're big, firm--

293
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:44,145
Ok, you know what.
Let's pause 10 seconds
for station identification.

294
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,012
We'll be right back
with "the score"
with gary brooks.

295
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:48,181
What the heck are you doing
in here, sasha?

296
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:49,715
What do you mean?
What do I mean?

297
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:51,583
You're walking around
all sexy, that why
I mean what I mean.

298
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,251
Gary, since we're
in the workplace,

299
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:56,387
I would appreciate you not
referring to me as sexy.

300
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,924
Oops. Dropped my pen.

301
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,431
Curtis: Gary!

302
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,468
Gary! We are back
from station id.

303
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:17,603
Well, roll another one!
We're picking up pens
in here!

304
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:22,173
So, do you want you turn
with the chiropractor?

305
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:25,009
No. I want you to get out.
I'm trying to do a show here
professionally.

306
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,745
All right. Well, it's
my turn with rhonda anyway.

307
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:36,052
Ok. Where were we?

308
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,189
Ok. Welcome back
to "the score" everybody.

309
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,623
My name is gary brooks.

310
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:44,992
How about we take a call.
We have glenn in chula vista.

311
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:46,594
Glenn, what can
I do for ya, pal?

312
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:48,295
Yeah, hey gary, listen,
I was wondering,

313
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:49,696
What do you think
the raiders have to do

314
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,431
To put together a better
team for next year?

315
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:54,269
Well, I'll tell you, glenn,
if your fans are tougher
than your team,

316
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,638
You have a big turn on.

317
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,908
I'm sorry.
Did you say, turn on?

318
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,910
Yeah, turn on. You gotta
turn on the power, kiddo.

319
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,445
Oh, my god I've never seen
bodies move that way.

320
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,713
Are you talking about
darren mcfadden?

321
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:12,916
Yes, I am. I'm talking
about darren mcfadden and
his perfect, supple bottom.

322
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:19,989
Thank you!

323
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:30,764
Allison!
Alli, I need your help!

324
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:31,832
Gary, shh.
What?

325
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,600
What's going on?

326
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,301
Why are you in the pantry?

327
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:36,536
I thought you were tom.

328
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:41,507
Oh, no. Is it a surprise party?
Did I miss his birthday?

329
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:43,509
I didn't get him anything.
He likes olives, right?

330
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,245
No, look. I quit my job and
I don't want him to know.

331
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:48,480
So, when he comes home.
He's going to go upstairs.

332
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,716
And I'm going to come out
and pretend I just got home
from work.

333
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:53,152
Yeah. But you're in here
for no reason. He doesn't get
home for another hour.

334
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:54,386
So, you're safe. Let's go.

335
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,787
All right.

336
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:56,955
Car.
Oh!

337
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:58,223
There's a car.

338
00:14:58,224 --> 00:14:59,724
All right.

339
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:00,958
Why'd you quit your job?

340
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,426
Gary, I couldn't stand it.

341
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:04,361
It was like I was
his personal assistant.

342
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,831
He made me do all his
grocery shopping for him,
pick up his dry cleaning.

343
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,399
I mean, it was like being
married to you

344
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,636
Except I didn't have
to watch one steven
gutenberg film.

345
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:15,205
Steven gutenberg
is an american treasure.

346
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,606
Ok.

347
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:19,275
Gary, listen to me.
I took off all of this time
to raise my kids

348
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:21,343
And now I have to pay
my dues all over again?

349
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:22,778
But I want to teach
tom a lesson,

350
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,214
So I'm hiding in the pantry
like a coward.

351
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,616
Tom totally respects you.
Tell him you quit your job.

352
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:29,884
He will completely understand.

353
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:30,918
Both: Aah!

354
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,886
Oh, jeez.

355
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,121
Hi, honey.
Hey, mom.

356
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,255
Hey, dad.

357
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:36,290
'sup.

358
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,825
Can I have the triskets?

359
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,493
Oh, yeah.
Here you go.

360
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:42,596
Thanks. You guys should come
listen to this cat lady show.

361
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:44,164
It's so interesting.

362
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:47,167
Did you know that cats
have no sense of hot and cold
in their feet?

363
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:49,168
Really? That's kind of
fascinating, actually.

364
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,873
I gotta go.
Antique bob comes
on in 10 minutes.

365
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,509
All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.

366
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,275
This is ridiculous.
All right.

367
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:01,942
So, hey, gary.
What did you want?

368
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:05,378
Sasha's trying to get me
to regret my incredibly
stupid decision.

369
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,746
But it was her stupid decision
to shorten my show

370
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:09,413
That made me make
my stupid decision.

371
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:10,481
Car!

372
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,514
No, it's the neighbor's,
allison!

373
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:12,515
All right.

374
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:13,516
What am I supposed
to do about sasha?

375
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:14,749
Ok. Just do
the same thing to her.

376
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,849
Make her regret her decision
to shorten your show.

377
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,348
I mean, who could fill
someone with regret
more than you?

378
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:21,515
I mean, remember me?

379
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,016
White dress,
flowers in hand,

380
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,285
Priest asking me if I would
take you as my husband.

381
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:26,619
You did not regret that.

382
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,121
Yeah, but you know what?
When the priest changed
the vows to

383
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,491
"are you double,
triple, super-duper sure
you'd want to do this?"

384
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,726
I should have taken it
as a sign, gary!

385
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,695
The only reason we were
standing there is curtis double
dog dared me to marry you!

386
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:45,735
Welcome back to
"dramatic...Paws."

387
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:48,204
I'm sue the cat lady.

388
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:51,841
Ok. We have carla
from monrovia on the line.

389
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,543
She's the mom of 2 sweet
little 6-month-old calicoes.

390
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:55,911
Go ahead, carla.

391
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:59,147
Um, my question is.
When I bring ginger
home from the vet,

392
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,217
Why does mr. Roboto
hiss at her like he's
never seen her before?

393
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:03,751
She's still at lunch?

394
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,253
Yeah. Yeah.
What are you doing?

395
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:07,722
Blowing up
the cat lady.

396
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:13,125
The answer to your question is
mr. Roboto hasn't
seen ginger before.

397
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:16,595
Cat's can't actually recognize
one another by sight,

398
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,196
Only by smell.

399
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:20,765
Isn't that interesting?

400
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:23,467
Yes, it is.
That's really interesting.

401
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:27,003
Thanks for you call.
I've got germaine from santa
monica on the air.

402
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,406
Germaine,
who's daddy are you?

403
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:33,109
Yeah, I don't have a cat.
But I do have a question
about the lakers.

404
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,610
Do you think they're better
off with ron artest

405
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,912
Or should they have stuck it
out with trevor ariza?

406
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:39,715
I'm sorry. I think you may be
calling into the wrong show.

407
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:43,618
This isn't [in radio voice]
"the score"
with gary brooks?

408
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,086
I thought that show
went 2 hours.

409
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,654
What is that?
Some kind of weird cat show?

410
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,322
I don't want
to talk about cats.
I want to talk about sports.

411
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:51,090
No. It's recently
been shortened.

412
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:54,560
That's a terrible idea
to shorten a sports show
for a cat show.

413
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:57,463
Well, I could take a stab
at answering your question.

414
00:17:57,464 --> 00:18:04,135
Sure, artest struggled early,
but he's good for 16 points
and 5 boards a game.

415
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:07,638
And come playoffs time,
you're gonna want his strong
presence in the paint

416
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:10,674
To bang with bateer,
nowitzski, carmelo,

417
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:15,178
And likely king james
if they make the finals.

418
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,514
You just aren't going to get
that with a slasher like ariza,

419
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:18,714
Who, to bring it back
to the subject,

420
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:22,784
Plays the post
like a pussy cat. Pussy cat.

421
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,887
Gary, what are you doing?

422
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:28,189
I don't know.

423
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,991
Why don't we go
to my office?

424
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:32,893
Uh, thanks.
I love your show, sue.

425
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,531
Sasha, look. I'm sorry.

426
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,632
You shortened my show.

427
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,867
I freaked out. I took it out
on sue the cat lady,

428
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:44,603
Who apparently knows more about
the lakers than phil jackson.

429
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:48,605
Gary, you never had
to make a choice.

430
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:52,207
Look, I know working
together makes
dating complicated,

431
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,676
But I was willing
to give it a try.

432
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:57,110
So, was I. I really wanted
to give it a try.

433
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:59,145
And then I just spazzed out.
I'm sorry.

434
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,246
Uh, it wasn't just you.

435
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,814
I wanted to show you
how wrong you were,

436
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,515
So I dressed sexy

437
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:09,152
And nearly crippled myself
with that split I did.

438
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:12,489
Look, could we maybe
try this again. You know what?

439
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,456
Let me rephrase that.

440
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:16,092
I would really like
to try this again.

441
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:19,161
So, would I.

442
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:20,995
Ok. Great.

443
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:24,965
But if we do this, we have
to sit down and hammer out
an ironclad set of rules

444
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,199
That we stick to
no matter what.

445
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,266
Ok. I agree.

446
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,268
Good. But first...

447
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,674
Let's pick up some pens.

448
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,155
Hey, mom.

449
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:47,889
Hi, honey.
How was work today?

450
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,591
Uh, great. They promoted me.

451
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:53,160
When someone orders
a special hogey de la dia--

452
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,728
That's what we call it--

453
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:57,730
Someone rings a bell. Ok.

454
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:00,933
You're looking at
the guy who tells the guy
to ring the bell.

455
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,201
So, how was work for you?

456
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,304
Actually, I've got something
to tell you.

457
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,073
I quit my job.
I just--

458
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,975
It wasn't what
I hoped it would be.

459
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,643
And I couldn't make it work.

460
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,878
I hope I didn't let you down.

461
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,646
Thank god.

462
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:17,647
Huh?

463
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:18,748
They fired me.

464
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,416
What?!

465
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,384
Oh, gosh! Why, honey?

466
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:24,618
Well, someone ordered
the special hogey de la dia.

467
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:25,786
Yeah.

468
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,287
And they asked if they could
have ketchup on it. Ok.

469
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:28,755
You don't put ketchup on it.

470
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:31,023
It completely offsets
the flavor,
and everyone knows that!

471
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,691
Yeah.

472
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,359
I refused to give the order
to ring the bell.

473
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,561
Oh, gosh, tommy. I'm sorry.

474
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:39,797
Yeah. Well, I had to hand in
my hairnet, my key to the
condiment closet--

475
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:42,933
That's why we call--

476
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,435
That's what they call it.
Ok.

477
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,603
Tommy, it's going to be ok.

478
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:49,872
The point is that we tried.

479
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,908
We're just going to move on
to bigger and better things.

480
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:57,211
You know, we're just gonna find
something that's better suited
to us. You know?

481
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:01,448
Yeah. Well, how about just
living off dad like we've
been doing this whole time?

482
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:03,450
Hey, if it ain't broke--

483
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:04,918
Ohh!
