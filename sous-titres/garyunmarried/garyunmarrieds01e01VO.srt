1
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:04,952
- Please, let me see it, please.
- You've already seen it.

2
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:06,810
Yeah, but never in the light.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,025
I'll show it a great pile of respect,
I promise.

4
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:11,222
But I was eighteen
when I got it, alright.

5
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:12,287
Okay.

6
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:17,992
Awesome!
Pink skull.

7
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:21,794
That's edgy and feminine.

8
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:23,674
Oh, shut up,
it's slutty and you know it.

9
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:24,964
You are not a slut.

10
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:28,354
Really? I just spent the night
with the man I hired to paint my condo.

11
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,256
That would make you more of a whore.

12
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:32,466
- Goodbye.
- No, no. Stay! Stay!

13
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:35,014
Come on. Come on. I'm kidding.
Alright?

14
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:37,707
Listen, I have this enormous lake house,

15
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:40,882
that I'm painting for a guy
while he is out of town, but,

16
00:00:40,883 --> 00:00:44,649
how would you like to spend the rest
of the week-end with me there, okay?

17
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:48,416
I only spend one night with you and
you wanna take me away for the week-end?

18
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:49,989
I must have been pretty amazing.

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,544
Until I check the video tape
from last night, I won't know for sure.

20
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:59,082
- What was that?
- My front door.

21
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,334
- Is somebody here?
- I hope not.

22
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,002
- Hi, Dad
- I'm here.

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,891
Dad?

24
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:06,645
Okay, a few things that I probably
should have told you, aside from owning

25
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:09,197
my own painting business
and all this boying charm,

26
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,051
I have two kids,

27
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:13,346
- Gary? Hello?
- and an ex-wife,

28
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,698
We're two and a half minute
into my time.

29
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:17,121
who might be a nazi.

30
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:19,215
Why didn't you tell me?

31
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:22,480
I was gonna tell you, the very next
time we weren't having sex, okay.

32
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:26,276
Come on. It's not like I lied to you,
I don't lie, I'm not a liar.

33
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:28,027
I'm on the phone.

34
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:32,818
Vanessa, I'm really sorry. I've only
been divorced for three months,

35
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:35,642
and I haven't seen anyone since
the split and I was gonna tell you, but

36
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,157
you were too good to be true,

37
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:39,010
and I didn't want to scare you away.

38
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,444
Like the tiny little detail
about you having a family?

39
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:43,479
You didn't tell me
you were double-jointed,

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,712
at one point,
I thought I had broken you.

41
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:49,270
Yeah, well, I'm not double-jointed,
I just don't like to complain.

42
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:57,494
Hi, son. Hi, sweetie.
Where's mummy?

43
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,295
- She's in the kitchen.
- Great thanks.

44
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:03,326
Dad! I've got another picture of Al Gore
to put on the wall next to my bed.

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,667
That's... creepy, Louise.

46
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,391
Allison, what are you doing here?
It's not my week-end.

47
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:17,869
All you have in your refrigerator is
2 beers and a bottle of ranch dressing.

48
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,790
I know. I'm running low on beer.
Why are the kids here?

49
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,864
You get them every tuesday
and thursday,

50
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:28,912
every other week-end and two weeks
in the month of july, okay?

51
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:35,257
We alternate bithdays
and major holidays.

52
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,838
I know this is a lot of words in a row,
but please Gary, try to follow.

53
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:42,754
I'm following but you kept them last
week-end, which was suppose to be mine,

54
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:44,643
that doesn't mean
we automatically switch.

55
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,796
We were doing
a twelve hours juice cleanse,

56
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,357
- and I knew you would not honor it.
- Probably not,

57
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:51,861
when my kids are starving,
I tend to feed them.

58
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,281
I'm sorry if that makes me
the fun parent.

59
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:58,970
Hey kids, throw away your books,
get rid of your toothbrushes,

60
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,702
you're with daddy, now.

61
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:04,381
Dad says my Al Gore picture is creepy.

62
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:07,962
Honey, it's not that it's creepy,
it's just every inch of the wall

63
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:11,466
in your bedroom is covered with pictures
of either Al Gore or Mahatma Gandhi.

64
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:14,968
You know? Thank God, you have that one
picture of that guy from Entourage.

65
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,761
That's Che Guevera, Dad.

66
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,392
I don't know what the actor name is,
Louise, and I'm just glad that you...

67
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:26,030
have a crush on somebody
closer to your own age.

68
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:30,099
Your father isn't criticizing you,
he knows both you and Tom

69
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:33,722
are gonning to have lots of healthy,
wonderfull relationship.

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,276
- We know, mum.
- We know, mum.

71
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:39,730
Why do you say stuff like that to them?

72
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,392
Because, Children of divorce

73
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,121
are more likely to struggle
in their own relationship.

74
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:47,792
There is an entire chapter on it
in "Rules for a perfect divorce".

75
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,137
The book that Dr. Krandall
gave both of us to read.

76
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:53,173
God! You haven't even
opened yours, have you?

77
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:56,741
I don't have to read it, I have
the audio version sitting on my couch.

78
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:01,514
Gary, we both agreed
to follow Dr Krandall rules,

79
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:03,197
because it was the best for the kids.

80
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,871
- They are doing great.
- Really?

81
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,155
Have you noticed that Tommy
is scared to death of girls?

82
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,762
He should be affraid of girls,

83
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,275
they pretend to like you,
and then they take all your stuff.

84
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,453
Look, Tommy will like girls
when he's ready to like girls.

85
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:21,940
Dr Krandall and I have encouraged him
to make female friends in Second Life.

86
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:24,523
Oh no, that dorky computer game?

87
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,563
It's an online society, Gary, okay?

88
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,446
It's a safe place for him
to meet other teens.

89
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,187
Yeah, maybe a congress man.

90
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:35,840
Bye kids, have fun with your dad.
I never did.

91
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,685
Alright, you are a liar, that's a lie.

92
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:39,699
I know, but it felt good saying it.

93
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:42,138
Which one takes Ginkgo before bed?

94
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:46,267
I would really appreciate it if you
didn't quizz me about my own kids

95
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,803
It's Tommy. Louise.
I know it's Tommy.

96
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,235
It's Louise. Tommy!

97
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:54,066
One capsule, right before bed,
with plenty of water.

98
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,779
- That's Louise.
- I knew it was Louise.

99
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,625
Gary Unmarried: 1x01 - Pilot

100
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,495
Transcript : charliea
Synchro : charliea / Sixe

101
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,130
Hey, pal.

102
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:18,406
Hey, look at that, Second Life.
That's pretty cool.

103
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,699
You know, we didn't have anything
like that when I was a kid.

104
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,802
We had... outside.

105
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,871
Your mum's telling me you can meet
girls in there.

106
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:33,077
It's called "In World".
Yeah you can meet tons of girl, tons.

107
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,047
- You ever meet one?
- No.

108
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,197
There is one girl that I really like
at school, her name is Danielle,

109
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,877
but we are never "In World"
at the same time so...

110
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,536
Tommy. Listen to me, okay.
Hear me out.

111
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:51,741
If there's ever a girl that you meet
in this world,

112
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:54,576
maybe you can bring her
over to the house,

113
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,906
she can come to your room,
you guys can study, talk.

114
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,591
- A girl in my room?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,613
- I can't invite a girl over here.
- Why not?

116
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,427
What if she expects me to, you know,

117
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:05,693
tap it?

118
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:18,401
What would you be tapping?

119
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:20,833
- I don't know.
- Okay, that's great.

120
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:23,297
Look, you're fourteen years old.
You're not gonna have to worry

121
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:24,661
about girls for a while.

122
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,242
- Thank God.
- Okay.

123
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,195
Look, I have to go see about a job,
do me a favor,

124
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,873
keep an eye on your sister for me?

125
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,624
If I try to give you Ginkgo tonight,
don't take it.

126
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,021
- Hey, Dennis.
- Hey.

127
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:47,641
Has the owner been by today?
What's her name... Vanessa?

128
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,015
I saw her car a while ago.

129
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,024
Really? When?

130
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,390
This morning, in front of your house.

131
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,304
Alright, yeah. We hooked up last night,
it was amazing but

132
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:00,537
I think I might have scared her off
and she never wants to see me again.

133
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,843
- Jackpot!
- No.

134
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:06,771
That's not a jackpot,
I mean I really like this girl,

135
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,118
I wanted to see where this thing
was gonna go.

136
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:12,086
No, no, no. Don't do this,
you just got divorced.

137
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,488
You're a free agent.

138
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:16,417
You don't sign with the first team
that shows you their facilities.

139
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,334
I'm not looking for a long term
relationship with Vanessa,

140
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:22,924
I just wanna spend some time with
someone cool, sexy and has a tatoo.

141
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:26,624
You just described Paco, and he's not
looking for anything serious either.

142
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:27,683
Really?

143
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,000
Hey, Dennis. Is this okay...

144
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,018
Is it okay, if I took the fabric
to the color of the wall?

145
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,238
Yeah, help yourself,
just be carefull what you touch.

146
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,201
You could have tell me that yesterday.

147
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,798
Look, Vanessa, I'm really sorry
about last night.

148
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,939
Vanessa, please talk to me.

149
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,525
Look, I'm a big girl.
We had a good time last night,

150
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:54,664
I know you're not ready
for this and that's fine.

151
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:56,652
But I'm ready for this. I really am.

152
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:58,726
It's just that my ex-wife and I,
we decided

153
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,401
to do this divorce by a couple of rules
for the kids' sake,

154
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:05,421
like how long to wait before we start
seeing other people, and last night,

155
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,444
I'm pretty sure I broke
a lot of those rules,

156
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,289
as well as a few of
my own personal records.

157
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:14,788
Two was a personal record?

158
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,070
Yeah.

159
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:22,095
Look, Vanessa,

160
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,381
I really like you. I do.

161
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,781
If you give me another chance, I'd love
to see how this thing turns out.

162
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,147
Really?

163
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:32,759
What about the agreement
that you have with your ex-wife?

164
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:35,842
I'm gonna take care of that right now,
I'm gonna go talk to my ex-wife Allison,

165
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,333
and I'm gonna tell her no more rules.
Okay? Can I see you later?

166
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,234
I don't know, this seems like
a really bad idea.

167
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,838
I'll take that as a maybe.

168
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,591
It's open.

169
00:08:56,996 --> 00:09:00,227
Sorry, I'm still getting used to having
to knock on my own door.

170
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:03,202
It's my door now,
and of course you don't have to knock,

171
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:04,817
you can ring the bell.

172
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:09,295
Look, I came over here to talk to you
about something that's really important.

173
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:12,543
And I don't want it to end in a fight.

174
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,229
- It's about dating.
- I'm not interested.

175
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:16,836
Delightfull.

176
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,008
No, I meant other people,
dating other people.

177
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,527
Preferably people
who don't turn the lights on during sex

178
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,830
and ask me
what I'm trying to accomplish.

179
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:26,854
I did that one time, Gary.

180
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:29,184
And you seemed to be lost, okay?

181
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,987
What is it you
don't want to fight about?

182
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:34,576
I know we've agreed
to these rules, okay?

183
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:37,433
And one part of the rules is when
it's okay to start seeing other people,

184
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:39,996
and I think that time is gonna
come up soon for either one of us,

185
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:42,814
and I think it's important that when one
of us does see someonelse,

186
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:45,446
that the other one
doesn't make a big deal out of it.

187
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,887
Okay, I promise when you start

188
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:50,238
seeing someone,
I'll not make a big deal about it.

189
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,491
Oh my Gosh! That's great. And then,
when you wanna see somebody,

190
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:55,534
I won't make a big deal out
of it either, okay?

191
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,750
Good, cause I'm getting married.

192
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:58,830
What?

193
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm engaged, and thank you.
I have been a rack

194
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,106
trying to figure out
how to break it to you, and now,

195
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:08,945
I can finally tell the kids,
and wear this.

196
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:10,780
Oh my Gosh.

197
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,636
Who are you getting married to?

198
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,303
Well, someone that I've been seeing,
since we split.

199
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,968
Actually, you've been seeing him too...

200
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,145
... every Tuesday at 8am.

201
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:27,763
Dr. Krandall? You are marrying
our marriage counselor?

202
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,847
I know, it's just so crazy, right?

203
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,152
The guy that's always covered
in cat hair and crumbs?

204
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,804
And he wears a turtleneck sweater
even though he doesn't have a neck?

205
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:40,288
Gary, he's sensitive and brilliant,
and he makes me feel young.

206
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,990
Of course he does, he's eighty.
He's in his fifties.

207
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,236
I don't know what to say.

208
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:47,772
Well, you know what?
A lot of people go with congratulations.

209
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,570
Okay. You know what then?
Congratulations.

210
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,724
Congratulations on marrying
the person who we both went to

211
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,295
to try to hold our marriage together.
Oh my Gosh!

212
00:10:57,296 --> 00:11:00,127
Isn't there a rule against that?
Isn't there a law against that?

213
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:01,504
Come on, Gary! Grow up!

214
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:04,186
The heart doesn't know how to follow
a bunch of stupid rules.

215
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:09,401
This is good for both of us,
maybe this will force you to move on to.

216
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:11,277
Maybe I already have.

217
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:12,985
Please.

218
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,931
Don't pretend to be seeing someone
just to compete with me.

219
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,342
That is sad.

220
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:23,157
I'm not competing with you Allison, you
are engaged, to be married, you've won.

221
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:26,917
Okay? And your prize, is a guy who rides
a bicycle with a windshield.

222
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:36,776
Hey, louise. Sweetie, will you help me
get rid of these groceries?

223
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,108
- Put 'em away for me.
- Sure, dad.

224
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,517
Hey, where's your brother?

225
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:43,515
Oh, he's in his room studying...
with a girl.

226
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,338
With a girl? Like a real, live--
human being person girl?

227
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,022
Way to go, Tommy.
Is she cute?

228
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,191
That's degrading.
I don't judge people by appearances.

229
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,095
That's why I love you, Louise.
But let's be honest.

230
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,083
You wouldn't have
all those pictures of Gandhi

231
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:59,118
on your bedroom wall
If he wasn't so hot.

232
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:05,872
Hey, son.
I didn't know you had company over.

233
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,440
It was your idea, remember?

234
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,502
Way to play along, Capt. Smooth.

235
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,897
Hi, I'm Tommy's dad.
Nice to meet you. I'm Danielle.

236
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,581
Hi, Danielle.
I ordered a pizza.

237
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,675
So if you guys
get hungry later, just...

238
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:18,844
yell.
Tommy, do you have a question?

239
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:25,851
Didn't you need me to help you with that
thing out in the hall?

240
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:30,135
Yes, I did. Excuse me.
Tommy, I need his help with the thing.

241
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:32,551
Out in the hall. It's very heavy.
We'll be right back.

242
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:34,947
Glad you brought that up.
I forgot about it.

243
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,154
What's wrong?

244
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,594
What's wrong?

245
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:41,075
There is a girl in my room!
What am I supposed to do with her?!

246
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,911
I don't know. Talk to her.
Tell her you like her hair.

247
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,664
I'm not gonna lie to her, dad.

248
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:49,333
Can't you just tell her I was
called away on some emergency?

249
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,451
Yes. Yes, I can do that.
That's a great idea.

250
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,653
I'll tell her that the F.B.I.
came to the door.

251
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,073
And they asked for you.

252
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:57,457
And they called you away
on a top secret mission

253
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,259
Called operation: Wuss Bag.

254
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,262
Now get back in there.
And talk to your friend!

255
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,431
- All right.
- Look. All right. Look.

256
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,134
Seriously though,
she likes you,

257
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,188
Otherwise she wouldn't be here. Ok?

258
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,225
You're a good looking guy.
You better get used to this.

259
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,708
She smells really good.

260
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,969
They all do.
That's how they get ya.

261
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,375
Louise, would you bring daddy a beer?

262
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,425
Mom says it makes me an enabler.

263
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,856
Well, in that case
bring daddy a shot of tequila, too.

264
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,415
That'll make you a bartender.

265
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,177
Hello, gary.

266
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,875
Hello, dr. Krandall.

267
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,893
I understand allison brought you up
to speed on our little indiscretion.

268
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,895
I'm not sure what makes me more mad--

269
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,955
The fact that you're sleeping
with my ex-wife

270
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,106
Or you made me keep
a dream journal.

271
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:57,776
I validate your rage, Gary.
And that's why I'm here.

272
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,071
To give you a chance
to exact your pound of flesh.

273
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:03,923
All I ask is that you not strike me
above the neck.

274
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,663
I have a book jacket
photo session in the morning.

275
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:11,285
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- I think you'll find it therapeutic.

276
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:13,418
I'm interested, too,
from a research standpoint.

277
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,002
I've never been beaten up before.

278
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,418
Yeah.
I find that hard to believe.

279
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,634
- Walter, stop right now.
- Allison, what are you doing here?

280
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:24,444
How come you don't have to knock
before you walk into my house?

281
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,033
Don't be petty, all right?
Walter left a crazy note

282
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:29,100
Saying he was coming
over here to take his lumps.

283
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,106
I don't want the two of you
fighting over me.

284
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:32,987
No. No.
The testosterone is raging.

285
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,147
Come on, now.
Give me your worst.

286
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,442
I already gave you my worst.
And you put a ring on its finger.

287
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:43,739
Hey, there's the pizza guy.
Maybe he'll hit you below the head.

288
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:47,800
Hi.

289
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,388
Hi.

290
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,071
I really appreciate
you coming over earlier.

291
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,706
It was really sweet.

292
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:56,709
There's something I need to tell you.

293
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:59,296
There's already a man in my life.

294
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:04,384
This is my son, Parker.

295
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,605
And he really needs
to use your bathroom.

296
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,517
- Hey, Parker, how are ya buddy?
- Hi.

297
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,817
The bathroom's upstairs, Ok.

298
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:16,682
I can't believe
he doesn't have a bathroom downstairs.

299
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,165
Come on in. Come on in.

300
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,807
Everybody,
this is my friend Vanessa.

301
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,263
That's my ex-wife Allison.

302
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:25,138
That's our former marriage counselor

303
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,117
and her new fiance Dr. Walter Krandall.

304
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,493
Charmed.

305
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:32,684
He says things like "charmed."
he's old.

306
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,375
I'm old.
He's afraid of birds.

307
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:39,706
Hey, you know what?
That was in a dream journal fella.

308
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:44,383
Gary, I'm sorry I doubted you
when you said you were seeing someone.

309
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:46,053
Vanessa and I just met.

310
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:50,129
We're still learning so many
wonderful things about each other.

311
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,260
- Oh, my gosh. Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you tell me?

312
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,395
If I may, there are obviously issues
the two of you need to discuss.

313
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:58,314
Yeah, you should go.

314
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:02,308
As it is my field,
I was going to offer to mediate

315
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,445
between you and
this delightful friend of yours.

316
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:07,065
No. No way, Krandall.
This one I like.

317
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,384
Fine, Gary.
I'll let you handle this on your own.

318
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,886
As long as you understand
how difficult it is

319
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,953
for a single mother
under these conditions,

320
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:19,605
Which is one of the most demanding
and challenging roles that there is.

321
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:20,919
Thank you.

322
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,463
I love him.

323
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,196
Isn't he great?
He bakes his own bread.

324
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,415
Yeah, I buy my bread at the store.
I support America.

325
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:36,971
Ok. I guess I'll go first.

326
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,398
Gary didn't tell me
that he had kids or an ex-wife.

327
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:45,672
Really?
You want me--

328
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,664
All right, well Vanessa didn't tell me
that she had a son.

329
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:52,951
And I felt humiliated and deceived.

330
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:55,489
I also felt humiliated
and deceived,

331
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,767
but for me
it's kind of a turn on.

332
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,252
And why didn't you tell Gary
you had a son?

333
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:04,973
Well, I've been a single mom
for a long time now.

334
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,577
and I'm very careful
about who I introduce Parker to.

335
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:10,990
And earlier, Gary come over and said
he wanted to see where this would go.

336
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,324
Which I do.

337
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,786
And the more I thought about it,

338
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,269
I think that i'm actually
ready for a serious,

339
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,164
long-term relationship.

340
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:21,606
I'm sorry. What?

341
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:27,319
I didn't think that you'd be ready
to commit to somebody this quickly.

342
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,391
Me? Then you don't know
anything about me.

343
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:31,988
Commit. Please!

344
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,921
You guys don't know
anything about Gary.

345
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:40,186
Because I love long-term,
long, long relationships.

346
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:44,105
I mean, gee whiz, my last long-term
relationship commitment just ended.

347
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:47,299
You know, so the timing is perfect.

348
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,217
I better call the pizza guy
to see if he got lost or something.

349
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:57,808
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing. No. I'm ok.

350
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:59,667
God, I haven't seen you
this freaked out

351
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,104
since that swan
chased you at Disneyland.

352
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,671
Leave me alone, I'm fine.

353
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,452
And why wasn't that swan
chasing anyone else?!

354
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,450
Gary, I know what you're
going through right now.

355
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,170
She wants more of a relationship
Than you think you're ready to handle.

356
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,110
I went through the same thing
with Walter.

357
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,846
Do you know how I felt the first time
he put his arms around me?

358
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,836
Where you helping him in
or out of the tub?

359
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:33,969
I would actually like
to see you be happy?

360
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:37,097
And Vanessa out there
could be a good first step.

361
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:39,938
For whatever reason,
she seems to like you.

362
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:43,604
There may not-- there may
not be many more out there like that.

363
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:47,816
- Are you saying I'm not a catch?
- Let her decide.

364
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,863
Just don't give her a reason
to throw you back.

365
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,242
You're right, Allison.
Thank you.

366
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,608
But to be clear, no.
You're not a catch.

367
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:04,693
- Pizza's here.
- Thanks, honey. Go tell your brother.

368
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:07,252
I can't.
He's in his room with a girl.

369
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:10,380
- Tom has a girl in his room?
- With the door locked.

370
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:13,192
Tom, it's mommy,
what are you doing in there?

371
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,620
Nothing now that
you just said mommy.

372
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:19,793
Tom, honey,
why is the door locked?

373
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,184
It wasn't.
It was just jammed.

374
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:24,942
Remember, dad said
he was going to fix it?

375
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:27,501
Yeah. Sorry.
I'll get right on that.

376
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:30,960
Louise said you had a friend over.

377
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,874
Yeah, Danielle went home.

378
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,573
But she got online. We're both
"In World" together at a beach party.

379
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:40,828
Oh, cool. Well, sorry to bother ya.
Have fun at your beach party.

380
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,339
Wear lots of sunscreen.

381
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:44,701
L.O.L.

382
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,664
You were right. He's not ready
to have a girl over to the house yet.

383
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:56,670
I know, Gary.
You try. You mean well.

384
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,013
But I have better instincts
when it comes to our kids.

385
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:01,851
I know.

386
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,356
Hey, handsome, the pizza's here
if you get hungry. Ok?

387
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,017
- Ok.
- All right.

388
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,531
Uh, Danielle, sweetie,
You left your purse out in the open

389
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,481
where we could all see it.

390
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:24,329
I told her I liked her hair.

391
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,997
Eh, no. Let's uh--

392
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:36,993
Let's keep this open, ok?

393
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,789
I want to talk to you.

394
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,436
My name's gary.

395
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:48,770
I have an annoying ex-wife
and 2 wonderful kids.

396
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,774
Hi, gary. I'm Vanessa.
I'm a single mom, and I have 2 tattoos.

397
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,110
You want to see
where this thing goes?

398
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,886
Sure.

399
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,451
Wait a minute. 2 tattoos?
Where's the other one?

400
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:05,231
Finish painting my condo,
and I'll show ya.
