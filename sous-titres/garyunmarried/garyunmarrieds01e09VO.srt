1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,345
Brooks is at the 20.
He's at the 15.

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,868
There's only one more man to beat.

3
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:13,842
Hi. Are you enjoying yourself?

4
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:17,073
Well, I was at first, and
then I realized the man I was married

5
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:20,307
to for 15 years was trying
to score with a dead, frozen animal.

6
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:25,493
How do you think I feel 15 years having
to sleep with a dead, frozen animal?

7
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,371
Very nice. Very nice.

8
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:33,621
All right, Gary, i'm gonna let that go,
but I do want to ask you one thing.

9
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:35,736
Please. Why are you being so stubborn?

10
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:38,351
Just come to my house
for Thanksgiving with the kids.

11
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:41,464
No. Thanksgiving is at my house this
year. You agreed to it Allison. Come on.

12
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:43,922
Yes, I know, but seriously, Gary,

13
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:46,402
are you going to attempt
to roast a turkey?

14
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:50,536
I mean, we both know you're not capable
of putting together a thanksging dinner.

15
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:53,594
OK, I think I am capable, and that's
what scares the stuffing out of you.

16
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:57,264
Yeah. I bet you can't even tell me
what goes in stuffing.

17
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,700
Everything in this box...

18
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:04,048
With either water or something
called chicken stock. It's my choice.

19
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:08,100
- Anybody home?
- It's my dad!

20
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:10,724
That means he got past
the dogs at the airport.

21
00:01:11,497 --> 00:01:13,954
- Hey, dad!
- Hey, Gary.

22
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:17,833
Your kids are just growing up so fast.

23
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:20,942
Yeah. They're amazing, man.
You should see them put away groceries.

24
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,691
- They're like artists, really.
- Thanks, dad.

25
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:25,634
I'm glad you appreciate the effort.

26
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,192
Come on, Louise.
Let's go put away groceries.

27
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,235
That was a con, you Dummy.

28
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,192
- And you.
- Hi, Jack.

29
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:35,347
How you doing?
Boy.

30
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:39,869
I hate to say it in front of my son,
but divorce suits you.

31
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:45,443
Well, I hate to say it in front of your
son, too, but I've never been happier.

32
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:49,106
This is nice, a little laugh
between the man who gave me life

33
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:50,924
and the woman who destroyed it.

34
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,779
Come on, Jack.
What have you been doing?

35
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:58,891
Well, I...
I've been traveling. Yeah?

36
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:02,203
I was shacked up with
an eskimo woman for a while.

37
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:06,737
You know, the eskimo people, they
have 100 different words for "get out."

38
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,905
- You want to show me to my room?
- OK.

39
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,581
Here we are.

40
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,879
- I'm sleeping on the couch?
- No. You're not sleeping on the couch.

41
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:20,822
I bought you a bed, my man.

42
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:24,521
Daddy, look at this?

43
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,811
An air mattress. Great.
Where do I dig my latrine?

44
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:34,053
You know, Jack, your room
is still available over at my house.

45
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,771
- Really?
- No, no. Maybe, but no.

46
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,919
My dad's staying here
with me and the kids.

47
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:41,422
You still got that shower
that gets you everywhere at once?

48
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:42,621
Yeah, I do.

49
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,416
'Cause two weeks in Baja, and
I'm still carrying a lot of beach on me.

50
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,723
I have a shower here, too, dad.

51
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,641
You know what?
I also had to replace that old bed with

52
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:56,752
a nice pillow-top mattress, and
I promise not to say a word if you want

53
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,662
to burn your incense.

54
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:03,365
That's OK, Allison. Look, my father
is staying here for Thanksgiving.

55
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,886
The kids are staying
here for Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving

56
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:07,701
is staying here for Thanksgiving.

57
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:11,402
The only thing that's not staying
here for Thanksgiving is you. Bye.

58
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:15,035
OK. OK, Gary.
But the offer stands, Jack,

59
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
and I know that my mom
would love to see you.

60
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:24,789
Wait a minute.
The exquisite Connie is there?

61
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:29,007
I should have let mano shave my back.

62
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,128
Vanessa pulled up out back, dad.

63
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:36,057
Hey, that's my friend. She's super hot.
And I told her you're not blind,

64
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,970
so don't do the
"I'm just shaking your hands" gag.

65
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:43,844
No. It's Parker.

66
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,837
You don't have to play
with Parker, Tommy,

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,007
but you do have to be
nice to Vanessa's son, OK?

68
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:49,698
I know that, but he always hits me.

69
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:52,019
- That's his age.
- In the testicles.

70
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,024
Hey, my dad's here.
You want to meet him?

71
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:06,189
Yeah. Great.
How are you going to introduce us?

72
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,694
I'll tell him you're a friend of mine,
we used to date,

73
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,070
and every once in a while,
you call me just to have sex.

74
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:12,181
I do not!

75
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:15,211
I know, but I'm just letting you know,
that is on the table.

76
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:18,894
Louise, where's grandpa?

77
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,621
He left with mom.
He said our water pressure was too low

78
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,773
to get all the sand
out of pirate's cove.

79
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:27,161
Oh, my gosh. She stole my dad.

80
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:30,508
She lured him away with the promise
of a mattress and a sandless crack.

81
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:34,307

Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]

84
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,218
- Honey.
- What?

85
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,996
Your pie seems a little dry.

86
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,784
Did Gary like dry pie?

87
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,750
Mom, I don't know.
You're gonna have to ask Gary, OK?

88
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,735
I can't. You drove him away.

89
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,980
I did not drive him away, OK?

90
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:58,730
I mean, why can't you just be happy
for me now that I've found Walter?

91
00:04:58,813 --> 00:04:59,714
I am,

92
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:03,868
but your fiance seems a little.
Now, how do I say this politely.

93
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:05,556
Antiquey.

94
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,561
Mom, he is a brilliant therapist,
and he is handsome and caring,

95
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,690
and he's only 15 years older than me.

96
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,841
I told your father he should have
hugged you more as a teenager, but...

97
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:21,620
Your little breasts frightened him.

98
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,547
- What did I do now?
- Withheld affection from your daughter,

99
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:30,855
darling, but you're a scratch
golfer now, so it was worth it.

100
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:35,533
Now, Allie knows I love her?
Don't you, alligator?

101
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:38,810
Of course. Of course I do.
There it is. OK. There it is. OK.

102
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:41,070
Yes, Walter, it's a hell of a fish tank.

103
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:44,207
Thank you. I toyed with the
idea of becoming a marine biologist,

104
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,414
but we Krandalls are
not a buoyant people.

105
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,161
There's a common expression in sweden.

106
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:50,944
**(Suedois)**

107
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:54,311
Which means
"to sink like a Krandall."

108
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,917
Charlie, you rushed right past us. Come
back in. I just got some whistler crabs.

109
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,860
You know, they have a cream for that.

110
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,275
Do we have any beer?

111
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,435
Charlie, you do not need a beer.
It dulls your senses.

112
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:16,835
You're right. I'm gonna
eat turkey and take a nap later.

113
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,638
I better be on my toes.

114
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,919
- I see the beer.
- Like a menopausal Superman.

115
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,958
Connie, is it possible you
get younger every time I see you?

116
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,974
I don't know, Jack.
Is it possible you're stoned?

117
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:33,747
It's always possible.

118
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,701
One of the biggest
football days of the year,

119
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:40,324
and you replaced
the television with an aquarium.

120
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:43,391
This is every bit
as entertaing as football.

121
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:46,844
Look! A box fish just swam
through the Fiji finger coral.

122
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,675
That's the Marine equivalent
of a touchdown right there.

123
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,407
Which one of those fish
would kill me if I ate it?

124
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,584
All right!
You watching the Dallas game?

125
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:03,212
No, no, no, but we just watched
a carp take a dump underwater.

126
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:09,213
First of all, a carp
is a freshwater fish. Second of all,

127
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:12,593
all fish eliminate waste underwater,
so it's funny on two levels.

128
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:18,277
- You really don't have to try so hard.
- Sorry. Dad?

129
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,771
- So, Gary, what do you want?
- I want my dad back, Allison.

130
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:27,696
What? I got in the car to come back
here, and he jumped in all excited,

131
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,661
like we were going to the dog park.

132
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:33,081
Come on, Allison. With all the
hot shower talk and the pillow-top

133
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,663
bed and the liberal incense policy,
you sold this place

134
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,123
like it was Woody Harrelson's
bed and breakfast.

135
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:41,972
Gary, if you want to be with your dad,

136
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,847
then just bring the kids over,
and we'll have Thanksgiving dinner here.

137
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,465
No, Allison,
you're not stealing my Thanksgiving. No.

138
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,927
I am not taking a jacuzzi
with you, Jack.

139
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,398
Connie, it's a soak in a hot tub,
not an invite to burning man.

140
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,599
- Hi Gary.
- Hi honey, good to see you.

141
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:57,735
Connie and I are about to take a jacuz.

142
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,344
I am not taking a jacuzzi!

143
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:02,887
Dad, what are you doing? Get in the car.
Let's go back my house.

144
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,830
That's where Thanksgiving is this year.

145
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,515
Come on, Gar. Why don't
you just bring the kids over here?

146
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:12,642
- You putting on your bathing suit?
- I am not putting on a bathing suit!

147
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,253
Far out!

148
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,761
All right. You win, Allison.
We should have

149
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:22,686
Thanksgiving here. I'll go get the kids,
and I'll bring them over, all right?

150
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,465
You see? Was that so hard?
I mean, look. I mean, you try,

151
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,445
but Thanksgiving is what I do.

152
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,093
Can we still have our touch football
game at my house with the kids?

153
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,033
Of course.

154
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:34,501
Would you do me a favor?
Would you get Louise's sneakers for me?

155
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,252
- Yeah. I'll be right back.
- OK. Thank you.

156
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:38,161
Sure.

157
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:46,816
I'm just looking at the beers.
Like little puppies in a window.

158
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,199
I think the little sad
one is my favorite.

159
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:53,218
Charlie, I'm not gonna lie to you.

160
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:55,536
I have so much imported
beer in my refrigerator,

161
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,673
I barely have any room
for all the domestic beer I just bought.

162
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,247
I could really use a drinker.

163
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,868
Well, that's tempting, but if I left,

164
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,264
Connie would cut off my giblet bag.

165
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,954
Come to my house.
Come to my house, Charlie.

166
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,148
The second half of the Dallas game
is about to start.

167
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:15,637
I have a bird in the oven,
a 42-inch flat screen, no fish.

168
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:17,715
- I'll be in the car.
- Atta boy!

169
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:24,221
- Gary, this place is great.
- Yeah. It's small, but it's crappy.

170
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,053
And it smells like a bar.

171
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,194
You know, it didn't come that way.
I had to do that all by myself.

172
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,085
My place is like an Indiana Jones movie.

173
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,052
You touch the wrong thing, and you got
this great big boulder bitching at you.

174
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:46,271
So you eat in here?

175
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,652
Yeah, almost every day,
right in front of the Tv.

176
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,481
Hey, one time,
I had this big thing of ice cream,

177
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:54,360
and I went up to bed and I forgot about
it, then came down the next morning,

178
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:57,407
I picked up that sucker,
and I drank it like a giant Malt.

179
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,095
I will rember that story
for the rest of my life.

180
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,797
Vanessa and I beat the boys at football.

181
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:08,028
Parker was my teammate. He kept trying
to attack him, dad. He doesn't get it.

182
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,923
You told me to attack the guy
with the ball. You had the ball.

183
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,048
My bad.

184
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:14,602
I'm never having kids!

185
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,060
Oh, my god.

186
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:24,153
- Hey, sweetie.
- You'll scare it away.

187
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,213
- Charlie, this is my friend Vanessa.
- Hi. You must be Gary dad.

188
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,443
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not. You're Allison's.

189
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:33,580
Whatever.

190
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,578
- Are you gonna be able to join us?
- I'm all sweaty from football.

191
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,687
I'm gonna go upstairs and
hit the showers, but

192
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,502
save me a beer, and I'll be back
down to watch the game.

193
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,968
You are the greatest man who ever lived.

194
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,932
I'll drink to that.
Let's freshen up our beers. Or

195
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:55,081
is it time to tap the Pony Keg?

196
00:10:57,088 --> 00:11:00,291
I'm not crying.
I just got some pretzel salt in my eyes.

197
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:07,289
- Dad, what the hell are you doing?
- Having the best day of my life.

198
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,818
Get in the car.
I'm taking you back. Come on.

199
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:14,286
Hey, Charlie, I found these two
20-ounce belgian beers way in the back.

200
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:18,024
They're pretty cold. Sorry about
all the frost clinging to the glass.

201
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:22,305
Dad, we're going.

202
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:26,265
- I don't think so, alligator.
- Yeah. He doesn't think so, alligator.

203
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:31,026
Dad, mom has been looking for you,
Walter is afraid he offended you,

204
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,959
and I haven't seen Jack since he took
the screen out of the kitchen faucet,

205
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:36,254
grabbed an apple,
and ran out the back door.

206
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:41,188
Sounds like things are really
falling apart at your house, Allison.

207
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:43,994
Wouldn't it be so much easier
if everyone just came over here?

208
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:48,242
Gary's got a beautiful turkey
in the oven. You should see it.

209
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:50,750
Hey, that reminds me.
I got to go baste my bird.

210
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,389
And check the turkey.

211
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,238
That's a good one. I like that.

212
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,959
You know, dad, with Gary cooking,
there's not gonna be any dinner.

213
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,931
Hey, if he doesn't run out of
"i don't care" juice, I don't care.

214
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,674
Look, Gary, don't worry. It's not ea...

215
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,674
- Who made that for you?
- I made it.

216
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:13,056
Look at this. It is beautiful.
It should be on the cover

217
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,274
of "better homes than Allison" magazine.

218
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:19,114
What? Oh, my gosh.
You can actually hear the flavor.

219
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,047
Listen. "I'm delicious."

220
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,262
"In your face."
"I'm delicious."

221
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:27,254
Stop playing with your stupid bird and
tell my dad he's coming back with me.

222
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:30,435
Look, you know what? Your dad's a grown
man. He can do whatever he wants.

223
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:33,877
But whenever you want to exchange
your hostage for my guest, call me.

224
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,626
A Charlie,
why don't you put your feet up? Relax.

225
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:53,978
Really?

226
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,024
It does look comfortable.

227
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:59,820
You want to go really crazy?
Take your shoes off first.

228
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,438
Nice. Nice.

229
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,546
This is so wrong.

230
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,533
This is so wrong.

231
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:15,440
Hey, it's been 20 minutes.
I have to go baste Lucille.

232
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:17,290
And check your turkey.

233
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:19,137
All right.

234
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,725
Lucille! Oh, my gosh.

235
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:39,752
OK. Honey? Lucille?

236
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,872
Allison was in here,
but I didn't see Allison leave.

237
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:47,385
Allison ate my turkey.

238
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:50,934
No, no. Allison stole my turkey.

239
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:59,232
What have you done with my bird?!
Where's my turkey? Where's Lucille?

240
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:00,761
Who is this?

241
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:04,504
Don't you play games with me.
You know who this is. I want my turkey!

242
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:06,530
Your turkey is safe, for now.

243
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:08,888
It's cooking at an undisclosed location.

244
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,182
Is that how you're
gonna play this, Allison?

245
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,740
Have my dad back at my house
in a half an hour,

246
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:18,562
or the temperature in the oven goes up
15 degrees for every minute he's late.

247
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,637
You wouldn't dare.

248
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,045
You have no idea what
i'm capable of, Gary.

249
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,829
Bring hiback,
and no one gets overcooked.

250
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,918
Honey, I wasn't snooping, but I was
looking through your underwear drawer.

251
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:39,188
Mom!

252
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,895
Well, somebody's got to tell you this.

253
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,704
Men don't like granny panties.

254
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:50,608
- They like the t-back thong, like this.
- like this.

255
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:55,723
Jack, you weren't supposed to see that.

256
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:59,442
Well, I did.
I'm downloading it to my hard drive.

257
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:03,818
OK, before I vomit into my yams, could
you please finish setting the table?

258
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,098
Allison, I got your father in my car.
You know, I had to tell the guy

259
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:10,132
we were going to a strip club
just to get him out of the house.

260
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:13,344
- He has to be inside the house, Gary.
- How do I know my bird's OK?

261
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,145
- Please, Gary. Grow up.
- Grow up? You stole my turkey.

262
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,810
- You stole my dad.
- That's because you stole my dad.

263
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:20,815
But you wouldn't
bring the kids over here.

264
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,641
Should I rinse these, or are we going
for a summer camp vibe?

265
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,386
Gary, you said you were just
popping in to get your VIP Card.

266
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:33,265
- Charlie, where have you been?
- With Gary,

267
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:37,647
drinking bear, eating salty snacks,
and putting my feet on furniture.

268
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:40,300
Hey, Connie,
I put our place cards together,

269
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:43,192
so right now my spoon
is touching your fork.

270
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,302
- Hi, son.
- Hi, Traitor.

271
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:49,736
Hold everything.

272
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:53,295
You put your feet on the furniture?!

273
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:59,032
Yes, and from now on,

274
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:01,530
that's how i'm gonna roll.

275
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:08,320
- Not in my house.
- You're damned right.

276
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:12,925
I'm moving out.
I want to get a place like Gary's.

277
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,332
- What?
- What?

278
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,448
Score!

279
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:20,005
You see what you did, Gary?
You happy now?

280
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:21,621
- What's going on here?
- Today

281
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,369
is Charlie Carswell's Independence Day.

282
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:27,342
And I will celebrate it every year!

283
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:30,032
My dad wants a divorce.

284
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,953
This is a marriage counseling emergency.

285
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,534
Mom, dad, I have an opening
a week from tuesday!

286
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:36,545
Damn it, Gary.

287
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,710
This all your fault. Why couldn't just
bring the kids over the first place?

288
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,189
- What it has to do with anything?
- You would have been here.

289
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:44,924
You would have gotten my mom off my back
and kept my dad entertained,

290
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:46,688
You would have taken him to football.

291
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,832
Hold on a second.
This is makes sense to me now.

292
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:51,331
This isn't about you thinking
I can't handle Thanksgiving.

293
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:55,089
The real fact of the matter is, you
can't handle Thanksgiving without me.

294
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,177
- That is ridiculous. There's one thing

295
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,152
If there's one thing I don't need,
it's you.

296
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,305
What is that?
Oh, god, Gary! The fire!

297
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,211
All right. Dad, come in here!
How many times do I have to tell you.

298
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:06,813
- Don't put towels next to the flame.
- You know what? Thanks a lot.

299
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:09,074
- I can handle it.
- No really, you can't handle it.

300
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:12,183
Like I would ever depend on your
for anything, like, ever again, Gary.

301
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,418
Gary! I cut my foot. Please help me!

302
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:21,589
- This is a giant cut here, kiddo.
- You're gonna need some stitches.

303
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:26,908
- Your dinner.
- Thanks, mom.

304
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,124
A lot of blood down there.
Feeling woozy.

305
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,674
- Walter, you're pale as a ghost.
- Actually, he's always that way.

306
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:37,607
Krandall,
put your head between your legs.

307
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,025
- This is not a time for insults, Gary!
- It'll keep you from passing out.

308
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,383
Sorry. With our history, I thought
you meant something else entirely.

309
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:47,087
Hey, Charlie, pull the car around, OK?

310
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:49,360
We got to take her to the hospital.
All right.

311
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:53,905
- Beer?
- Sure.

312
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,886
You want to see my underwear?

313
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,200
They're stitching her up now.
You know, they said that's their fourth

314
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:07,912
yam-related accident tonight.

315
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:12,170
- Thanksgiving. Who knew?
- Yeah. The holidays are nuts.

316
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:14,654
Don't get divorced, Charlie.

317
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:17,188
I mean, you're gonna lost
half your stuff, half your money,

318
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:20,451
and no matter what, your wife is
still gonna find a way to yell at you.

319
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:23,401
You seem to be managing just fine.

320
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:27,057
Yeah, that's on the outside,
but when I'm home alone, on the inside,

321
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:29,227
I get pretty sad, and I cry a lot.

322
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,783
- Really?
- No. It's awesome.

323
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:35,063
Thank you.

324
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:38,408
Hey, alligator, how you doing?

325
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,989
Great. I got a couple of stitches
in my foot,

326
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:43,325
my dinner is ruined,
my parents are getting divorced,

327
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:46,436
and I got to hear a woman with a gunshot
wound break up with her boyfriend, but

328
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,290
not because of the gunshot wound.

329
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:52,839
Well, I'm not leaving your mother.
I was just blowing off steam.

330
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:54,610
Thanks, dad.

331
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,683
- There we go. There it is.
- I'll go get the car.

332
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:01,765
How you doing there, hot wheels?

333
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:07,343
I'm so mad at myself for calling
out your stupid name when I cut my foot.

334
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:10,875
My fiance's a doctor,
my dad's a doctor, and I what do I do?

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,044
I call for a painter I don't even like.

336
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:17,074
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You called for me by default, you know?

337
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,173
Your mom was drunk,
my dad was high, Krandall was Woozy,

338
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:23,258
and let's be honest, your dad's a
chiropractor. That doesn't really count.

339
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,039
I just...

340
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:30,252
I wasn't prepared for how hard this
first holiday was gonna be, you know?

341
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,977
Yeah. The whole day was kind of weird.

342
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:36,044
Weird? I stole a turkey, Gary.
I'm not proud of that.

343
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,538
Look, I wasn't really
ready to do without you either,

344
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:44,909
because you're the only one that
knows the way I like my pumpkin pie.

345
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:46,311
Dry.

346
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:54,858
I just, I just don't think
we've been apart long enough

347
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:58,001
for me to get through the holidays,
you know, without us all being together.

348
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,448
You have the kids for Christmas.
I could come by with them.

349
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:02,420
No. I'll probably be ready by then.

350
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,301
OK, that's fine, then, isn't it?

351
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,654
This was a darn good dinner, everybody.

352
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,941
Can a brother get
a gobble-gobble for the turkey?

353
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,839
Gobble-gobble!
Gobble-gobble!

354
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,391
Well, I would like to thank
everybody for salvaging what they could

355
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,664
from my kitchen and
bringing it over here.

356
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,218
And I would like to thank Connie
for being my wife.

357
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,930
Well, thanks, chuckles.

358
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:38,284
Put your shoes on.
We're not hillbillies.

359
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:43,325
Why is grandpa Jack always eating?

360
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,695
He just has a good appetite, Tom, OK?

361
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:51,890
Then why does his shirt
smell like my art teacher?

362
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:56,004
- That's incense, Tom.
- Killer incense.

363
