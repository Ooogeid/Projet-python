1
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:06,488
- What?
- Is it weird having boobs?

2
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:14,503
I figured. Do you use
your boobs for good or for evil?

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,198
- One for each.
- All right.

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,523
Did I tell you that my ex-husband
wants to buy our son a dirt bike?

5
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,041
Well, that's awesome.

6
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,682
... Ly bad. Awesomely bad idea.

7
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:32,677
Ronnie wants to have our son
do all of these dangerous things,

8
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:34,708
like take kickboxing

9
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,697
and get a BB gun
and go out for musical theater.

10
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:41,264
- Well, musical theater isn't dangerous.
- It still scares me.

11
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,642
Listen, I'm sorry your ex-husband
bothers you, OK? He upsets me, too.

12
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:49,680
You know what we should do?
Just to show him, we should watch

13
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,591
the rest of this game butt naked.
Come on,

14
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:54,139
let's take our clothes off,
and we'll show that guy.

15
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,625
All right, I gotta go.
My best friend Stephanie

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,223
is graduating from beauty school, so the
gang's getting together tonight my bar.

17
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,775
- Girl's night out?
- No, the guys will be there, too.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,023
Snake and Dunker, and Hammer and Dave.

19
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:09,954
Dave?
What kind of a name is Dave?

20
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:13,847
I'd invite you to come along,
but I really kind of want you to meet

21
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,178
them one on one, 'cause they're
kind of tough in a crowd.

22
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:17,323
No worries.

23
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:20,626
And they're really protective of me
ever since Ronnie and I got a divorce.

24
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:21,803
Of course they are.

25
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,881
- And whenever anybody new wanders in...
- I don't want to go.

26
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:29,699
I mean, I would go, but there's
a lot of stuff for me to do here.

27
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:33,199
You're gonna sit around and think about
what it's like to have boobs.

28
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:34,421
Yes, I am.

29
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,043
I use mine for evil.

30
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,671

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,119
- Hey, here are the kids, right on time.
- Hey, guys! How was your dad's house?

34
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,509
Awful. Dad made us eat healthy.

35
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:57,615
- What?
- And he forced us to exercise.

36
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,387
And the only stuff he
let us watch on tv was violent.

37
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:02,597
Tommy, nonviolent.
What's the point of rehearsing

38
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,165
it on the whole drive over
here if you're gonna choke?

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,569
OK guys, go put your stuff away and wash
off the weekend you had with your dad.

40
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:13,644
What's going on here?
Tiny food. Flowers.

41
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,012
Oh my gosh, did Krandall die?

42
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm alive and well, Gary.

43
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:21,688
Thanks to my Scandinavian genes
and a diet rich in omega 3S.

44
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,983
Omega 3S. Look at Krandall.
Seeing sority chicks on the side. Nice.

45
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:29,296
That's raw chicken, Gary.

46
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,391
So, what is going on here?

47
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:38,159
Walter and I are
having a little party tonight

48
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,534
to celebrate his brilliant new book.
It's called "round two of your life."

49
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:45,168
It's a how-to guide focusing
on new relationships after divorce.

50
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:47,775
Well, that sounds amazing.
I can't wait to not read it.

51
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:51,294
You know what, gary,
you actually should read it.

52
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,882
You can always take a couple of aspirins
afterwards for your thinkin'headache.

53
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,904
There a whole chapter on the importance

54
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:00,428
of being accepted into
your new partner's social circle.

55
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:03,823
So, tonight we're celebrating
my new book and introducing Allison

56
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:07,932
- to my oldest and dearest friends.
- Oldest and dear! That's great.

57
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:11,501
Sounds like a who's who of who's left.

58
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:16,521
Are you this funny when you're
making walls a different color?

59
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,808
My friends are gonna
adore you tonight, mango.

60
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,312
Thank you, cranberry.

61
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:25,555
So you're gonna meet all
of cranberry's posse tonight?

62
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:30,319
You know what, gary,
tonight meeting walter's friends

63
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,851
is a very important moment
in my relationship with walter.

64
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:35,464
I think you're just jealous
because your relationship

65
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:37,465
with Vanessa isn't as far along as mine.

66
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,619
Let me tell something. My relationship
kicks your relationship's ass.

67
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:43,126
Is that right?
You've already met Vanessa's friends?

68
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:45,480
- Yes I have. Of course I have.
- Really? I don't think so.

69
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:46,948
- I have. Really.
- Really?

70
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,978
- Fine what are their names?
- What her friends?

71
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,339
Her friends are Monica, Chandler...

72
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,216
- He's dim but likable.
- Poor Gary.

73
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,479
I'm so sorry that Vanessa hasn't
introduced you to any of her friends.

74
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:03,276
You know, maybe Vanessa's just
waiting for one of her girlfriends

75
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,321
to get a boyfriend who's worse than you.

76
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:09,031
For your information, she told me
that her friends are pretty protective

77
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:11,088
since her divorce,
so we're just taking it easy.

78
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,676
Yeah, that's exactly what I would say
if I didn't want my friends to meet you.

79
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:16,487
But then she went on to say,

80
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:18,660
"why you come hang
out with all my friends tonight?"

81
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,306
- Really?
- That's what I'm doing.

82
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,120
Where are you going? Central Perk?

83
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:27,898
No, it's at a bar, and all her friends
are gonna be there 'cause one of her

84
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:31,308
closest girlfriends graduated beauty
school. We're gonna have a big party.

85
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:34,393
I hope it goes better than
the first time you met my friends.

86
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,086
You remember that?
You completely embarrassed yourself.

87
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,571
You ran in the bathroom and climbed
out the window, and then you fled.

88
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,328
Yeah. I did not fled.

89
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:47,149
The door got stuck.
I had to go out the window. Right?

90
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:50,312
And then once I was outside,
I chose to go home.

91
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,679
Sure, Gary.

92
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,055
Hey, listen, have a ben gay
old time at your party tonight, OK.

93
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,180
If the conversation lags, just talk
about the last great tomato you had.

94
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,933
I love a good tomato.

95
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:10,157
Raw, cooked, grilled, sun-dried,
succulent, or stuffed with crabmeat.

96
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:11,468
I love crabmeat.

97
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,760
Here's to Stephanie
for finally making it through

98
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,441
all 6 months of beauty school.

99
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:24,281
Now none of us will ever
have to pay for highlights again.

100
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:30,774
Is there a barber in the house?
I got a hair emergency.

101
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:31,955
I need a perm.

102
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:36,747
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

103
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:40,852
Yeah, what's up? I was just in the'hood,
and I thought would holler "what's up"!

104
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:45,594
What is wrong with that man?

105
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,599
Everybody, this is the guy that
I've been seeing. Gary. Gary, this is...

106
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,511
No, hold on. Let me guess.
Let me guess. Hold on a second. That's,

107
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:55,506
Dunker.
That's Dave. That's Stephanie.

108
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:59,412
- Actually, I'm Dave. That's Dunker.
- And I'm Stephanie.

109
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,015
How about you guys all switch seats?
That way I'm still right.

110
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,166
I'll talk to you in a minute.

111
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,128
I thought that you didn't
want to meet my friends.

112
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:11,979
You said your friends were pretty rough.

113
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:14,255
I figured I'd come in,
just let'em get to know me.

114
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,283
Everybody likes me.
Relax. Everybody loves me!

115
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,548
I know. I just wish you would
have given me some warning

116
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:22,083
- so I could have put their muzzles on.
- I'll tell what. I'll be real still.

117
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,353
I'll let them sniff my hand first.
It'll be OK. I promise.

118
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:32,209
Vanessa, private party
upstairs wants to see a manager.

119
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,684
Yeah, but I'm not working tonight.
Can't ed take care of it?

120
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,223
Ed went to his girlfriend's
place of work to meet her friends.

121
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,497
It's a very important
step in a relationship.

122
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:44,426
This will only take a minute.
Do you want to come with me?

123
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:48,112
No, that's OK. I'll be down here,
and I'm gonna chill with your peeps.

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,202
Good luck,
but just don't say "chill" or "peeps".

125
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:54,953
All right.

126
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:04,422
She's pretty awesome.

127
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:08,452
But you guys already knew
that because you're the gang.

128
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,347
And you're the famous Gary
who painted Vanessa's condo.

129
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,590
That's right.
You know, this is a funny story.

130
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:19,933
I was painting a condo in her building.
She need a painter for her condo.

131
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:23,533
I was available. I wound up painting
her condo. That's how we met.

132
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:26,020
Why is that a funny story?

133
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,598
It's not, really.

134
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,388
You know what,
I probably should have said true story.

135
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:36,009
Yeah, but there's nothing
about it anyone would ever doubt.

136
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,511
I should have just said story.

137
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,591
So, Stephanie. Hey!
All right, the graduate.

138
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,382
Congrats! That's great. That's good.

139
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:49,980
You know, you don't look at all
like a stereotypical

140
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,153
- hair stylist at all.
- What does that mean?

141
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:54,702
You know,
the stereotypical hair stylist...

142
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,965
the gossiping, the gum chewing.

143
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,024
"Oh, my god! And then she totally,
like, slept with tucker."

144
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,618
You never heard them talk like that?
They got the crazy eye shadow,

145
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,524
- the big long nails.
- Like these?

146
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:10,716
Longer than that.
Like guinness book record long nails.

147
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,053
I'm gonna go into the bar.
Do you guys need anything while I'm up?

148
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,484
'cause I'm up,
and you guys are obviously not

149
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,455
even looking at me at all.

150
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:24,470
Everyone look down at their phones.
Perfect. You're all under my command.

151
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:29,382
Hey, Bartender,
can I get a beer, a tall one?

152
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,377
And then maybe take the corkscrew
and stab me in the face.

153
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:35,017
Rough night?

154
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,592
You could say that. Met my
girlfriend's friends for the first time.

155
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:44,045
Should do after this? Get a root canal
so you day ends on a positive note.

156
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:49,033
- How long you been divorced?
- 6 months. Is it that obvious?

157
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:51,631
Kind of. I was there a couple years ago.

158
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:53,617
Does it ever go away?

159
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,492
Well, here's the thing.

160
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,534
Vanessa said she's
gonna be a little while.

161
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,413
And said not to add the
word "Izzle" to anything.

162
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,671
- You know Vanessa?
- Yeah,

163
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,383
she's my new girlfriend.
Are you a friend of Vanessa's, too?

164
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,143
- I'm Mitch.
- Hey, Mitch. I'm Gary.

165
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:19,559
I met Vanessa. I was painting
her condo in her building,

166
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,269
and then she needed her condo painted,
so I did. That's how we met.

167
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:26,276
- That's a funny story.
- I know, right?

168
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:33,199
- The first guests have arrived.
- OK, I only need a couple more seconds.

169
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:35,149
I have to finish toasting
these sesame seeds,

170
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,841
and if you cook'em
for like a second too long. Crap!

171
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,193
You didn't finish sentence, dear. What
happens if you cook them for too long?

172
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:44,565
Walter, honey, I just need
3 more minutes, OK?

173
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:46,549
You've been working
since early this morning.

174
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:49,766
- Are these sesame seeds even necessary?
- You know what? No, Walter.

175
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,717
Sesame chicken skewers
don't need sesame.

176
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,643
In fact, why do we even need
the skewers? You know what we should do?

177
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:58,146
We should hurl a bunch of chicken at
our guests when they walk in the room.

178
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,221
Crap! Walter!

179
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:03,609
I'm thrilled that you're so excited
about this, but I want you to make sure

180
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,269
to relax and have fun.

181
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,153
Relax and have fun? Why the
hell would you say that to me?

182
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,816
I'm sorry. Sometimes I just spout off.

183
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,818
Walter, I can't relax now, OK? I just...

184
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,953
Do you know how long I've waited
to be part of a group like this?

185
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:20,899
I mean, educated, intelligent
people who travel and read books

186
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:23,329
and who don't quote
"caddyshack" on a daily basis.

187
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,869
I'm sorry. I should have understood
how important this is to you.

188
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,979
But I assure you,
the evening is gonna be beautiful.

189
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:33,408
And who's the author of this
"caddyshack"? Is it worth me reading?

190
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,663
God, do I love you.

191
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,279
Crap.

192
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:43,760
It looks like you're back on the horse?

193
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:46,014
I mean, you're already
meeting vanessa's friends.

194
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,566
I don't have a lot in common
with them, though. I mean,

195
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,557
Dunker and Hammer and Snoopy.
I don't know.

196
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,570
Yeah, they're kind of the odd squad.

197
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,080
What do you think of Stephanie?

198
00:10:57,254 --> 00:10:59,991
I like her nails.
I could do without the attitude.

199
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:04,471
- Stephanie's kind of a nightmare.
- Yeah, I kind of agree with you.

200
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:08,294
- So when did you meet Vanessa?
- A month after my divorce.

201
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,641
You don't waste time.

202
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,754
No, you know,
I probably jumped in too fast.

203
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,370
I should be out there playing the field,
I mean it's Vanessa. She's super hot.

204
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:21,579
- What are you doing here?
- I'm talking to your friend Mitch.

205
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:22,849
This guy's awesome.

206
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,140
I thought I told you to let me know
if you were ever gonna be in here.

207
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,971
I can come in here anytime I want,
'cause it's open to the public.

208
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:30,528
Am I right, Gary?

209
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:36,191
- I yeah. I don't know. What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

210
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,248
- This is my ex-husband.
- What?!

211
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,873
That's Ronnie?
He said his name was Mitch.

212
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:45,863
Ronnie Mitchell.
My friends call me Mitch.

213
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,540
Well, that's confusing.

214
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,463
Gary, why are you
talking to my ex-husband?

215
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:56,898
I didn't know that was Ronnie.
He told me his name was mitch.

216
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:59,722
I never would have talked to him if
he told me his name was really Ronnie.

217
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,893
I admit I was unclear on that point.

218
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:04,617
What, now you think
he's like a great guy?

219
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:07,853
No, but he's the first guy all night
to talk to me like I was a human being.

220
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,644
- Gary hates your friends.
- What?

221
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,235
Especially Stephanie.

222
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,813
- Who hates me?
- No, I don't.

223
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:16,535
- He said you were a nightmare.
- You said she was a nightmare.

224
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,468
- You agreed.
- I kind of agreed.

225
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,722
All right, Stephanie, I'm sure
that Gary didn't say anything like that.

226
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,535
- What's going on?
- Gary hates us.

227
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,410
- He does not hate you guys.
- He called you the odd squad.

228
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,546
- What's happening here?
- I'm going on record.

229
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:33,230
I don't like him. Me either.
- All right, you always do this.

230
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:36,467
Gary is a good guy. You can't
trust Ronnie. He's a total snake.

231
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:37,964
Yeah, thank you, Vanessa.

232
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:41,068
Why don't you ask your good
guy here why he said he rushed

233
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,969
into this relationship too soon.
He'd rather be playing the field.

234
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:45,972
Awkward.

235
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:49,233
All right, gary did not say that.
Gary, tell them.

236
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:50,880
Dude, what's your problem?

237
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:58,323
- Did you really say that?
- Did you, Be honest.

238
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:10,325
- What the hell you doing?
- Ira, thank god you're here.

239
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:14,407
- I can't tell how high up I am.
- I wouldn't risk it.

240
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:18,860
- I'm losing my grip!
- I'll never make it to you in time.

241
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:26,164
Why didn't you tell
me it was only 2 inches?

242
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:28,890
Because I rarely get to laugh
when I take out the trash.

243
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:34,859
They are loving the
sesame chicken skewers.

244
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:38,878
I know. Everything's going so well,
I feel like I should have bluebirds

245
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:41,682
and squirrels singing songs
and helping me out, you know?

246
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,332
You know, Cinderella, hiring adults
at a living wage is also an option.

247
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,459
God, they drink a lot.

248
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:53,205
It's like spring break
for all the old people out there.

249
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:56,705
If they start doing body shots, I quit.

250
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,064
Honey! You're doing such a great job.

251
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:00,955
Professor Meyers needs
another grasshopper.

252
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,936
I'm in the weeds here, mom.
I don't have time for blended drinks.

253
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,415
Allison, everyone is
having a wonderful time.

254
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,128
- The food is perfect.
- I know.

255
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:12,446
- The house is beautiful.
- Isn't it, though? Gosh.

256
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,479
There is one tiny thing, though.
It's barely worth mentioning.

257
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,154
What is it? Is it Tom?

258
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,872
Yeah, he's never bartended
for this many people before.

259
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:21,623
It's not that.

260
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,647
Apparently, you've been
telling everyone that

261
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:26,865
my book is a penultimate
book on divorce.

262
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,342
- It is.
- I know you mean

263
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,025
that in the nicest possibly way,
but penultimate doesn't mean best.

264
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,677
- It means second to last.
- What?

265
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,806
- God, no. It can't mean that.
- It's a common mistake, really.

266
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:42,088
I hear it all the time when I do
outreach work in shelters and jails.

267
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:46,158
Are you all right?

268
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:50,595
I've been using "penultimate" all night.
I said it about Christmas

269
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,684
and giving birth

270
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,436
and my freshman year of college. Now
they all think I didn't graduate! God!

271
00:14:56,956 --> 00:15:00,412
- Allison, everyone makes mistakes.
- No, Walter, they don't.

272
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:03,818
Ph. D's and lawyers don't make mistakes.
Only high school dropouts and me.

273
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:06,332
And I. High school dropouts and I.

274
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:09,402
Or me. You know,
either is really acceptable.

275
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:11,851
I don't know why I thought
I could do this Walther.

276
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,412
Thanks a lot, Allison. It's all your
fault. And because of his stupid book,

277
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:17,810
you have wrecked everything
between me and Vanessa!

278
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:20,996
Yeah? Yeah? Well, 15 years
of living with you has made me dumb.

279
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,991
This whole thing is your fault!

280
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,732
- What the hell just happened?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

281
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,993
All I did was criticize
her on one minor thing.

282
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,409
You criticized Allison
on a night like tonight?

283
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:35,206
Hey, do yourself a favor, Pal.
Sleep with one eye open.

284
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:38,382
Sadly, I do. It's a family affliction.

285
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:46,969
- Open up! I know you're in there!
- Go away!

286
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:49,783
Look, don't stick your
head in the tiny oven, OK?

287
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,743
I'm serious Gary. If you know what's
good for you stay out of this house.

288
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:56,468
If I knew what was good for me,
I would have stayed out of your pants.

289
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:57,826
Now, open up!

290
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:01,204
- No way!
- All right, I'm coming in.

291
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,288
Hey! Quit it!

292
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,097
Stop throwing china at me!
You're making a tiny mess!

293
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,362
- You made me stupid, Gary!
- What does that even mean?

294
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:17,655
All those years of living
with you with the zombie movies

295
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,514
and the video games and the zombie
movies based on video games.

296
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:23,358
I did not make you stupid,
but you made me make a fool out

297
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,556
of myself in front of
vanessa and all her friends.

298
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,305
And her ex-husband ambushed me.

299
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,171
Hang on. Why is any of that my fault?

300
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:31,458
Because you always make me
do things I don't want to do.

301
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,490
Whether you know it or not,
you make me do it.

302
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,924
Big deal. You were an idiot
in front of Vanessa's friends.

303
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:38,048
I doubt any of them
were rocket scientists,

304
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:41,404
of which there are several
in my house right now laughing at me!

305
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,484
Why?

306
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,699
I used the word "penultimate"
wrong all night.

307
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:49,665
Why would you even use that word?
Why wouldn't you just say "best"?

308
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:53,667
Do you see, Gary?
This whole thing is your fault!

309
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:55,344
Gee, stop hitting me!

310
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,429
What is...

311
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,403
We can hear you inside the house.
I'm coming in the window.

312
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:03,313
I'm coming in the door.

313
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:08,359
You two have got to stop
acting like children.

314
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,443
She threw pla!
She threw plates at me, Krandall!

315
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:13,377
I told him not to come in!

316
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,554
Enough of this! Sit down!

317
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,704
Don't you see what's happening here?

318
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:23,737
Whenever either of you get into trouble,
you seek each other out.

319
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,105
No, we don't.

320
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:29,660
You had a disastrous evening,
and you raced to allison's house.

321
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:33,285
You sought refuge in the one place
you knew he would come and look for you.

322
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,799
Ironically,
the way you two lean on each other now

323
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,004
is the very thing
that would have saved your marriage.

324
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,640
As your therapist, I wish
I would have discovered it earlier.

325
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,562
But as Allison's fiance, Gary,
back the hell off!

326
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:48,393
- I'm getting kind of sick of this!
- Calm down, Krandall.

327
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:51,424
It's like being yelled at
by one of those giant dipping birds.

328
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:54,246
I'm going back in the house.

329
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,806
I want you two to sit here
and think about what you've done.

330
00:17:56,931 --> 00:18:00,300
And when you're ready to start acting
like adults, you can come back inside.

331
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:07,323
- Your dad's really POD.
- Stop it.

332
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:14,353
You know, I gotta tell you.

333
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:17,137
In this tiny house,
your boobs look huge.

334
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,724
You're just trying to get on
my good side. I'm still mad at you.

335
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,293
Look, inside that house
there's a great party going on.

336
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:26,755
You made all the food. You made
people happy. The house looks fantastic.

337
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,504
Nobody's gonna rember
that you used a word wrong.

338
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:30,953
- I know.
- You know that?

339
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,801
How do I know that? Your bartender's
using Jelly Jars for shot glasses.

340
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:38,178
Those people are hammered. They're
not gonna remember anything. But me

341
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:40,865
you're gonna rember
everything I did wrong.

342
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,024
Don't tell me you
climbed out a window again.

343
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,343
Yes, I did.

344
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:52,422
Do you think you rushed into
things with krandall too soon?

345
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,433
Are you asking me if I think you

346
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:58,467
moved too quickly with Vanessa?

347
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:02,269
Yeah, but I'm doing it in a tricky way
where you think i'm talking about you.

348
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,932
Well, I don't think I did, but

349
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:10,817
I knew what I was looking for.

350
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:13,817
You know what you're looking for, Gary?

351
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,457
That's a big question
for a little house.

352
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:24,008
When your friends didn't like me,
what did I do to fix it?

353
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,819
You didn't have to do anything.

354
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:28,621
I didn't care what
my friends thought of you.

355
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,252
Thanks.

356
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:34,254
Here's a toast to you...

357
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:37,054
The penultimate ex-wife.

358
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,393
It sounds like it should be good, right?

359
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:42,403
- It's got "ultimate".
- Right in it.

360
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:49,737
We actually had somebody in the bathroom
searching for you stall to stall.

361
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,857
I'm sorry. I panicked. I felt like
I was being ambushed in there.

362
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,141
Well, I warned you.

363
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:56,521
But if you would have
stuck around for 5 minutes,

364
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:59,268
you would have seen everyone turn
on ronnie and ask what happened to you.

365
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,467
Really? You know,
I thought that might happen.

366
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:04,153
I thought dunker and
me kind of had a vibe going.

367
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:08,263
But I asked you a question in the bar.

368
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:11,690
Do you think that we jumped
into this too fast?

369
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,378
Yes, I do.

370
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:16,381
But hey,
I wouldn't want it any other way.

371
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,549
- Really?
- Really.

372
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,136
- Don't want to be playing the field?
- Not if you're not in it.

373
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,935
You're thinking about boobs again,
aren't you?

374
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,931
I don't have to think about'em.
I'm feeling'em.

375
