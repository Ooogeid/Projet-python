1
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:06,202
<i>Name the 13th president
of the United States.</i>

2
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:07,503
- Lincoln.
- Fillmore.

3
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:08,704
<i>Fillmore is correct.</i>

4
00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:11,504
<i>Name the largest city
in Nebraska.</i>

5
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,539
Lincoln!

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,041
<i>- Omaha.
- Omaha is correct!</i>

7
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:19,911
<i>A favorite childhood toy
blank logs.</i>

8
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:22,713
Legos!

9
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:24,715
<i>- Lincoln!
- Correct!</i>

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,469
Hey, Gary.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,952
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.

12
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:31,027
We went
to the dentist,

13
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:33,870
and he thinks that Louise is
gonna need braces at some point.

14
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,934
Braces? You just accepted
the guy's first offer?

15
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,825
You didn't haggle?
Maybe a retainer?

16
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:39,877
Some scotch tape
and rubber bands? That's...

17
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:42,225
Gary, Gary,
he's a dentist, ok?

18
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:46,138
He's not that guy in Tijuana
who sold you the bullwhip, ok?

19
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:48,893
I bet that guy
still cries to his friends

20
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:50,526
about the bath he took
on that deal, huh?

21
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,075
Whatever.
Honey, could you go

22
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:54,373
- start your homework, please?
- Yes. - All right.

23
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:56,202
And is Tom home?
We need to talk to him.

24
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:57,564
Yeah, he's in the kitchen.
Why? What's up?

25
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,045
He got another
tardy notice at school.

26
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:00,504
Another... oh. All right.

27
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,284
How do you want
to handle this?

28
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:05,565
You want to play
good cop/annoying mom cop?

29
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,245
Which one
do you want to be?

30
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:10,656
Uh, how about I play
the one with the 24-inch waist?

31
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:13,887
What's going on?

32
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,441
What's going on is,
you got your sixth tardy slip

33
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:19,303
in the last 3 weeks.
You leave for school on time.

34
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:21,897
Could you please explain to us
what happens between that time

35
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:24,282
and the time you actually
show up to class?

36
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:26,807
Well, we've been assigned
some really great books in english,

37
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:29,598
and I read on the bleachers
before school. I mean...

38
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,681
Huckleberry Finn,
The Grapes of Wrath...

39
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:35,572
I guess I just get lost in their
stories and lose track of time.

40
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,701
All right. All right.

41
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:40,509
I'm glad you're reading
before school, Tommy.

42
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,990
That's cool.
But you can't be late.

43
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:43,704
All right?
So get it together.

44
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,384
I will.

45
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:49,777
- He's lying!
- I know! I know! Right?

46
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,552
Like he's been reading?

47
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:55,644
"Oh, oh, oh!
I'm reading."

48
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,290
Shh!
All right, look.

49
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,335
First of all, I know he's never
even opened Huckleberry Finn,

50
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,819
'cause there's dust around it from
when he first set it down on his desk.

51
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,659
Second of all,
Grapes of Wrath?

52
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,842
That's not even a real book.

53
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,020
I'm supposed to believe there's
a bunch of vengeful grapes

54
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:10,032
just stomping around
the countryside?

55
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:12,009
Gary, uh,
The Grapes of Wrath

56
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,587
was written by John Steinbeck.
Do you remember?

57
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,936
Back in high school, you used
to wedge it in the car stereo

58
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,609
to keep it
from rattling?

59
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,619
- Remember? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I do remember.

60
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,596
But it was your fault
the car stereo was rattling,

61
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:25,445
'cause you wore those high-heeled
boots when we were doing it.

62
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,555
Gary, it was
40 degrees outside.

63
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,398
I wasn't gonna
take off my boots.

64
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,341
Besides you got to keep
your long Johns on,

65
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:34,255
'cause they had
a flap in the front.

66
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,470
Anyway, what are we
gonna do about Tom?

67
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,079
I don't know.
Every time I talk to him,

68
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,188
he gives me some
one-word answer like:

69
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,164
"Yeah." "No." "So?"

70
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,810
Well, you think
we should be worried?

71
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,752
Maybe.

72
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,095
Look, Gary, I just get the
feeling he's hanging out

73
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:52,641
with some troublemakers
at school, and I don't know.

74
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,583
You know, call it
mother's intuition,

75
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:56,524
but something's
going on with him.

76
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,162
Well, I'll find out
if there is,

77
00:02:58,163 --> 00:03:00,371
'cause I'm his father, and I
know my son tter than anybody.

78
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,312
- So, don't worry about it, ok?
- Gary, there's no harm

79
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:05,058
in ating that I might know
Tom a little better than you.

80
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,903
Uh, I'm his father.
Nobody knows Tommy

81
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,044
- more than I know Tommy.
- Really? Ok.

82
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:12,052
Uh, who's his
best frid?

83
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:13,593
- Conner.
- Wrong. Brian.

84
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,264
What's his
favorite food?

85
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,405
- Pizza.
- Wrong. French fries.

86
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,150
Uh, let's see. Who's
his favorite teacher?

87
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:22,357
- Lincoln.
- What?

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000

89
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,555
It's a slow go
on the freeways today.

90
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:41,091
We got delays on the
110, the 101, and the 605.

91
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:43,791
And hey, if you were the guy
today in the red pickup truck

92
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:46,426
that cut me off and said
that thing about my mother,

93
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,194
yeah, I'm gonna mention
that to your sister

94
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,963
when she's leaving my bedroom
tomorrow morning. Ok, pal?

95
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,498
That's traffic.

96
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,200
"The Score" will be back
right after this.

97
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,237
Hey, Curtis, do we really
have to do the traffic report

98
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,339
on the 3s? Why can't
we do it on the 5s?

99
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,107
That's easier
to remember for me.

100
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,842
Well, you know, we tried to get the
5s. We tried to get the 1s, the 7s.

101
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:08,244
They were all taken. So, it
was either this or the 9s.

102
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:11,113
But at that point, you may as
well just wait for the 1s again.

103
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,650
Hey, are you ok, man? You've
been irritable all morning.

104
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,319
Well, first of all,
I got stuck in traffic.

105
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,588
Then I sat in my van
and watched Tom's school

106
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,923
after he got dropped off
at the carpool.

107
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:26,860
You sat in front of a school
in a windowless cargo van?

108
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,729
Let me know
when your "dateline" airs.

109
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,064
It's not like that.
It's just, uh,

110
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,266
Tom's been really late
to school lately.

111
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,468
And, well, Allison's
mother's intuition...

112
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,703
She says it's 'cause he's
hanging around a bunch of punks.

113
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:40,871
I'm gonna tell you, a mother's
intuition is a powerful thing.

114
00:04:40,872 --> 00:04:43,974
When I was 15, I went
to New York city on this choir.

115
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,343
I mean, we're talking
3,000 miles away, right?

116
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:48,344
And after the performance was
over, I went to this party.

117
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:51,447
And I reached for a beer, right?
The phone rings, I pick it up,

118
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,815
and the only thing I hear
on the other end is,

119
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:56,451
"mm-mmm".

120
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:03,523
Gary, it was a pay phone.

121
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:07,793
That's amazing.

122
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:10,563
It's just, uh, I don't know.
I thought Tommy and I were closer

123
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:12,198
than me and my dad were.

124
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,133
My dad didn't come to
my high-school graduation

125
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:16,869
'cause he was freeing
a monkey from a laboratory.

126
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,971
Well, that's noble.

127
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:21,006
You know what's not noble?
Bringing the monkey home,

128
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,175
giving him my bike.

129
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:25,176
So, you stake out
Tom's school?

130
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:26,677
That's no way
to get close to him.

131
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:27,945
I don't know. What else
am I supposed to do?

132
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:29,846
- You got to read his emails, man.
- What?

133
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:32,682
The only way that you can compete
with her mother's intuition

134
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:35,351
is by stepping in the
21st century, my man.

135
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:38,087
I can't read Tom's emails. It's
a total invasion of his privacy.

136
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,255
Let me tell you about my
nephew Dwayne, all right?

137
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,491
Straight "a" student, and
then one day out of the blue,

138
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,760
his grades start falling. Now,
I asked him to talk about it.

139
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,929
He didn't want to talk about
it. So, I read his emails.

140
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,264
And it turns out, he was
involved in a bad crowd.

141
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,232
Like druggies?

142
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:54,201
No, it was an improv troupe. That
was their name... "a bad crowd."

143
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:55,468
Hi, Gary.

144
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:56,669
Hi, Sasha.

145
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,038
- I had a really good time
the other night. - Yeah.

146
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,539
I had a really good time
the other night, too.

147
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,377
Excuse me.

148
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,746
Oh, my gosh! Yes!

149
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,749
You're Laird Hamilton.
I'm Gary Brooks.

150
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,551
- Aloha, Gary.
- Aloha yourself, mister.

151
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,388
You've been such a huge
influence on my surfing.

152
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,957
This guy has surfed waves that
have gone on to destroy villages.

153
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,293
- He's gonna do our show tomorrow.
- Oh, hey.

154
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,529
Hi, I'm Curtis Taylor.

155
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,531
Not a big swimmer.

156
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,199
- Hi, Laird!
- Oh, hi, Sasha.

157
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Good to see you again.

158
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,768
Hey, why don't we all
go into my office

159
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,970
and talk about
what we're gonna do?

160
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:40,041
- I got a hug!
- I got an aloha.

161
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,609
So, as you know,
I am one of the organizers

162
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,610
of this big
"save the bay" event.

163
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,445
And if it's cool
with you,

164
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,246
we'd like you to go
on Gary's show tomorrow

165
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,447
and talk about the
beach cleanup coming up.

166
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,082
Well, it's totally cool with me, anything
I can do to help bring awareness.

167
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:55,517
What a generous spirit.

168
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:58,052
And it's tall.

169
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:02,122
It's a tall, blond...

170
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:05,390
- Very tan spirit.
- Uh, Sasha?

171
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,492
You know, I don't want
to toot my own horn, Laird,

172
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,628
but I shred it pretty hard
over at sunset beach.

173
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:11,929
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

174
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,763
I teach
a kiddie class there.

175
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:17,067
I like it 'cause
the bathroom's close by.

176
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:19,501
Hey, Laird!

177
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,470
When we were researching
for this event,

178
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:26,440
I saw this video of you coming
down the face of a 75-foot wave.

179
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:29,510
I... I literally
got the chills.

180
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,345
You know, I need to scare myself at
least once a day just to feel alive.

181
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:35,047
I mean, some days, I ride
a 30-foot barrel, or...

182
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:37,648
Sometimes, it's just
trying to tie my tie.

183
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:44,089
That is so funny.

184
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,591
Wait. That's funny,

185
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,926
but my sling blade
impression is dated?

186
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:50,595
Oh, no, no. I didn't say
it was dated.

187
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,130
I just said it was
an easy impression.

188
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:02,272
No, you guys aren't
doing it right.

189
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,874
You know, Gary, I'm a huge
fan of your show.

190
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,276
I mean, I don't know
how you do it.

191
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,244
The radio is like
your kingdom...

192
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:11,546
Kind of like the way
the ocean is my kingdom.

193
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,380
Yeah. I guess
you're right.

194
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:17,317
Except, I've peed
in your kingdom.

195
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:29,994
Hello?

196
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,662
Gary, it's me.
Listen, Louise says

197
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,530
she saw Tom
get into a car today

198
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,665
with some rough-looking
older boys after school.

199
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,634
All right. Well, maybe he's
just getting a ride home,

200
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:38,801
- you know?
- No, no, Gary.

201
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,503
She says she's never
seen these guys before.

202
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:41,971
All right, calm down.

203
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:44,106
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

204
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,609
I only know of one way to
figure out what he's doing.

205
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,211
Well, we better do something,
because my mother's intuition

206
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:52,213
is telling me
he's in trouble.

207
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,381
What's it likeo have
mother's intuition?

208
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,483
Well, it's sort of like
a feeling...

209
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:59,119
You know, probably a lot like
what psychics feel.

210
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,353
Wow. You know, I'll never
know what that feeling's like,

211
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,222
'cause I'm not
full of crap!

212
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,157
Oh! Gary.

213
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,425
Gary, what...
Look, I'm not doing anything.

214
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,460
I was...
I was looking at porn.

215
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:11,762
You know?

216
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:13,563
You're reading
his emails!

217
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:16,832
Well, I had no choice, Gary. I mean,
something is happening to my boy.

218
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,967
He's my boy, too. But I
would never stoop this low.

219
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:21,268
Oh, really, gary? Then why
was there a 300-foot cable

220
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,670
running from our neighbor's
satellite dish to our tv

221
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,639
for the mayweather-hatton fight?

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,708
Nobody owns
the airwaves, Allison!

223
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:30,810
How long have you
been doing this?

224
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,479
It doesn't matter!
5 weeks, Gary.

225
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,948
Look, look, look. There's a
whole bunch of kids on here

226
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,883
we have never even heard of.
They're using terms

227
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:39,784
that sound like
they're gang-related.

228
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:41,652
Do you want to know
what your son's doing or not?

229
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,287
No, not like this. No.

230
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:48,023
So, what are you gonna do? Just
stake out his school in a van?

231
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:50,891
- What kind of moron do
you think I am? - Well...

232
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:52,895
Look, Gary, come here.
Look at this one.

233
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:55,897
Look, kingrath20...
He's one of the new guys.

234
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:59,099
"Hey, T-Bone, we're
meeting at the spot at 7:30."

235
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,734
and then Tom replies,

236
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,870
"I can't do it.
English quiz first thing."

237
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:04,772
And then kingrat says,

238
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:07,374
"Blow it off. You'll take a makeup.
You don't want to miss this."

239
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,109
Ok, I'm really worried.

240
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,510
I'm worried, too.

241
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:14,413
Why do you make
Tommy sound like this?

242
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,582
Secondly, he didn't say he
was gonna ditch school.

243
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,451
That's a heck of a lot better
than what I did at his age.

244
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,719
The only time I ever went to
school was for pep rallies,

245
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,521
'cause there was that one
cheerleader that never wore underwear.

246
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:30,224
Yeah, I was no angel.

247
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:31,993
It's so weird.

248
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:33,861
He won tell me
what's going on.

249
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:36,396
I mean, I never told my dad
stuff, 'cause he didn't care.

250
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:38,364
He would just say things like,
"that's great, son.Going on.

251
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:40,966
We got company coming over. Why
don't you change the bong water?"

252
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:44,402
You think Tommy's, like,
not into my anymore?

253
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,270
Like, he's just over the whole
father-son thing, or what?

254
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,673
Oh, my God. Wait,
look at this. Look.

255
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,307
He's planning on
taking your van

256
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,342
and driving his buddies
down to San Diego tonight.

257
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,011
- Where are your keys?
- Don't worry.

258
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:55,012
They're in a place where
he will never find them.

259
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:57,214
Uh, in your van,
under the floor mats?

260
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:59,282
Under the floor mats!
That's even better.

261
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:04,020
Gary, he's not here.

262
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,688
- Get in the van. I'll explain it.
- What?

263
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:07,490
I have a good plan.
Get in the van.

264
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,526
And when you get in the seat, I
want you to scooch down really low.

265
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:11,827
Crouch down low.

266
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:13,662
And then when he opens
the door, we scare him.

267
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,396
He'll never pull
a stunt like that again.

268
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:16,331
That's good.

269
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,132
Hello!

270
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:30,343
Hey.

271
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:32,678
Look, Tom, I don't know what
you thought we were doing...

272
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,480
I know what you were doing.
You were reading my emails.

273
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:36,248
How do you think I know
you'd go to the van?

274
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:38,016
Ok. So, you caught us.

275
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,484
So, what, you weren't gonna
drive down to San Diego?

276
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,020
No. I just wanted you
to stop spying on me.

277
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:44,854
How could you be so sneaky?
I mean, you know,

278
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:46,623
sneakier than we were?

279
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,825
Ok, you guys aren't
that sneaky. All right?

280
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,926
Mom keeps forgetting to click
"marked as unread,"

281
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:54,896
and she responded "yes" for me
when Amanda asked me to junior prom.

282
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:57,799
I just think
she's so right for you.

283
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,434
Tom, look.

284
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:01,969
What the heck's going on, man?
You're not telling me anything.

285
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,904
You got all these new
friends all of a sudden.

286
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:06,473
I'm not doing anything.
Why are you invading my privacy?

287
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,875
Hey, as long as you're living in
my house, it's not your privacy.

288
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:12,344
It's my privacy.

289
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,013
I know that doesn't make a lot of
sense, but I'm very frustrated right now.

290
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,648
Ok, look. Honey,

291
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,516
if you're just
honest with us,

292
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,184
maybe it's something
we could talk about it.

293
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,618
I don't want
to talk about it.

294
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:23,186
Then you're grounded. What
do you think about that?

295
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:24,787
You leave us no choice. We're
gonna drive you to school every day,

296
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:26,488
and we're gonna
pick you up every day.

297
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,056
You're gonna do your homework
sitting in front of your mom,

298
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,424
or you're gonna come
to the radio station

299
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,092
with me and do your
homework there. That's it.

300
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:33,227
This sucks, ok? I've done nothing
wrong, and I'm always good.

301
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:35,028
Why can't
you guys just trust me?

302
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,097
Because I was a young man
once, and I know what it's like.

303
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:40,266
And I don't want you growing up to
be just like your mother. All right?

304
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:41,934
She was always
getting in trouble

305
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:45,104
for showing a little too
much spirit at pep rallies.

306
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:49,373
Would you let that go?
Our football team was 0-8.

307
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:52,275
I had to give them
something to root for.

308
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:54,477
How did they finish?

309
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:57,346
Uh, 0-10 but very happy.

310
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:02,116
You made the right
choice for Tom, ok?

311
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:03,818
If someone's caught with
their hand in the cookie jar,

312
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,251
you gotta take
the cookie jar away, ok?

313
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,086
That's what I found out
with Charlene.

314
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,421
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Was Charlene cheating on you?

315
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,825
No, man. She was just
eating a ton of cookies.

316
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,660
I mean, I'm all for a big girl,
but damn, I only got 2 hands.

317
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,428
You know. Oh!

318
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,896
We gotta get out of here. We got this
interview in 5 minutes with Laird Hamilton.

319
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,897
I don't see what the big
deal is with that guy.

320
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:24,733
We could do better
radio without him.

321
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:26,669
What about yesterday?
We had that whole debate

322
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,603
about the wackiest
name in sports.

323
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:30,705
And I thought you had me
with Ron Tugnutt.

324
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:32,040
Right?

325
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,674
Until this morning
on my drive in,

326
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:37,210
I remembered eastern Illinois
linebacker Lucious Pusey.

327
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,446
You ready to
do this, man?

328
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,482
Ok. Curtis, get Laird
set up in the booth.

329
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,517
I want to go over a
couple things with Gary.

330
00:13:45,518 --> 00:13:48,319
Oh, let me ask you a question. Who's
got the funniest name in surfing?

331
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,488
Probably
Buttons Kaluhiokalani.

332
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:53,324
Either him or...

333
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,727
Paul Danglebag.

334
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:58,062
I call that one.

335
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:00,831
Ok. So, you can talk
about surfing

336
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:03,032
and all the other cool
things Laird has done.

337
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,234
But really focus
on the charity event.

338
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,904
Ok, what about
how dreamy he is?

339
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:09,140
I mean, I'm sure you have a
list of how dreamy Laird is.

340
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,041
- You have one of those
for me, right? - Excuse me?

341
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,742
I've seen the way
you've been looking at him.

342
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:14,077
You've been giggling
like a school girl.

343
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,246
- I'm giggling like
a school girl? - Yeah.

344
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:18,014
A half-hour of
your show yesterday

345
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:20,784
was you and Curtis giggling over
that old baseball player's name.

346
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:24,253
Ok. I told Curtis the man's
name was pronounced "Koontz".

347
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:27,925
Ok? It's not my fault
Curtis said it wrong.

348
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:30,561
Yes. I will explain that to
the good people at Pampers

349
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,696
who will no longer
sponsor your show.

350
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:35,432
And yes, I am giving Laird
a lot of attention.

351
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,767
He's writing a huge check
for this event.

352
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:39,536
Really? Not because
he's so handsome?

353
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,171
Hey, it's not my fault
he's gorgeous.

354
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,738
Ah! I didn't say gorgeous.
You said gorgeous.

355
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,840
- You fell into my trap.
- What is wrong with you?

356
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,941
I'll tell you
what's wrong with me.

357
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:49,941
You're acting completely unprofessional.
This is a place of business.

358
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,608
And you're supposed
to act like a...

359
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:53,341
Oh, my gosh!

360
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:54,376
- Hi.
- How are you?

361
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:55,876
Hey, I'm Gabby.
Is Laird around?

362
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:57,411
He said I could sit down
in the interview today.

363
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:58,945
Hi, Gary.
I'm Gabby.

364
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,979
Hi. Why don't you come
with me in the studio?

365
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,014
Could I get you a drink
or a sandwich or something?

366
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:06,016
Maybe we could take an orange
and... Just pass it back and forth

367
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:08,518
- using only our necks?
- Uh, you know,

368
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,586
I'm good. I think I just
have to go see my husband.

369
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:12,621
Plus, from what I can
see, I think your neck

370
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:15,190
only sort of reaches
my chest. So, I'm ok.

371
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,759
I'm ok with that.

372
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,230
Welcome to "The Score"
with Gary Brooks.

373
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,902
We're here with Laird Hamilton,
renowned big-wave surfer

374
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:29,704
- and environmental activist.
- Aloha, Gary!

375
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:33,409
Ok, Laird, we get it.
You're from Hawaii. Ok?

376
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,746
Laird, let's take care of
business first. Let's...

377
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:40,115
Let's talk about
"save the bay."

378
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:43,385
Well, as you know, southern
California's coastal waters

379
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:46,320
are susceptible
to a lot of pollutants.

380
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,554
Pollutants. Totally.

381
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:51,520
So, we're involved with
everything from hands-on cleanup

382
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:56,157
to education to lobbying for
tougher environmental standards.

383
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:59,093
Oh, God!

384
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:01,094
I know this seems
very impressive.

385
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:03,396
- Gabby's also involved.
- Oh, yes.

386
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:06,997
For those at home, Gabby is
professional beach volleyball player

387
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:09,499
Gabrielle reece. She's also
an incredible mom,

388
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,135
a fantastic actress,
a beautiful model...

389
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,237
And... and my wife.

390
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:18,341
Laird, loosen the reins,
man. Chill out.

391
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,543
Hey, Gabby, since you're sitting
here, why don't you tell everybody

392
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,211
- about the event, ok?
- Oh, absolutely.

393
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:24,046
You know, this is
such a great event.

394
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:25,881
We really that
many people can come out

395
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:27,849
And join us
in Santa Monica.

396
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,484
This weekend...

397
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,319
All right.
Well, there you have it.

398
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,021
Gabby and I will be down
at Santa Monica tomorrow...

399
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,089
- I'll be there, too.
- Laird, my gosh!

400
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,492
Would you just
loosen up a little bit?

401
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:41,995
This is "The Score" with Gary
Brooks, and I'll be right back

402
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:44,330
with my special guest
Gabrielle Reece.

403
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,465
And Laird Hamilton.

404
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,834
Yeah, we're off the air,
pal. Nice try.

405
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:52,304
Very smooth, danglebag.

406
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,675
You're ogling the wife of a guy
who trains by running up sand dunes

407
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,777
with a log chained to
his waist.

408
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,613
Oh, I can take that guy,
assuming he's still

409
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,448
chained to a log
running up a sand dune.

410
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:04,283
Why is he training
like that, anyway?

411
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:08,621
Seems like somebody can't afford
a membership to the "y."

412
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:11,990
Allison's
here with Tom.

413
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:16,962
Well, with those pecs,

414
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:19,363
I mean, Laird could probably
just pick up that log

415
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:23,662
and just pound Gary
into the ground like a nail.

416
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:33,437
What? I can't appreciate another
man's beautiful, sculpted body?

417
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:36,339
Well, here's
your fugitive.

418
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,841
I gotta take Louise to dance
class, so he's all yours.

419
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,609
- Has he talked?
- Not a peep.

420
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,811
All right. Well, just sit
there and do your homework.

421
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,445
No foosball,
no vending machines,

422
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:46,680
and no pushing the "fart"
button on my computer in there.

423
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:48,181
Although a lot of times
during the show,

424
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:49,449
I'm not really even
pushing the "fart" button.

425
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,584
Oh, God.

426
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:54,586
Honey, you could make this a
heck of a lot easier on yourself

427
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,721
if you just tell us
what you're up to.

428
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,222
- No.
- No.

429
00:17:58,223 --> 00:17:59,891
All right. If he wants
to be grounded,

430
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,892
then just let Tommy
be grounded.

431
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:03,460
Tommy! How you doin'?

432
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:06,595
Hey, Laird, what's up?
What are you... ahem.

433
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:09,197
Hey, you weren't in Malibu
this morning. Are you all right?

434
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:11,166
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

435
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,468
Who is this man?
What is he...

436
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,536
I'm sorry. How do
you know my son?

437
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:18,704
And hello.

438
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:20,506
Aloha. I'm Laird.

439
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:21,873
Hi.

440
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,708
Hey. Malibu... you've been
surfing before school?

441
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,076
That's why you're late all the
time? Why didn't you tell me?!

442
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:29,410
Yeah, ok. You found out my
horrible secret. Are you happy?

443
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:31,511
I've been surfing before
school with Laird Hamilton.

444
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,479
Yeah, I'm thrilled!
I think that's awesome!

445
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,881
Why didn't you tell me? I could have
been out there helping you out. You know?

446
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,449
I don't know
how to explain it.

447
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,650
I just didn't want you to see
me until I was really good, ok?

448
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,354
I just... I guess the thought
of you seeing me shredding it,

449
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,723
and then you'd come out there,
and we could surf together, just...

450
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,793
Oh. Honey,
that is so sweet.

451
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,466
Did I mention I was a
cheerleader in high school?

452
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,334
We just met.

453
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,905
Well, I was.

454
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,276
Tom, I gotta be honest with
you. I feel like a complete jerk.

455
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:03,211
That's ok. It was
probably a stupid plan.

456
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,279
Oh, honey, your dad
would be proud of you

457
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,281
if you were a good surfer or not.

458
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:09,716
Yeah, whether you're a good surfer
or not. He's getting good, though,

459
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,752
- Right?
- Oh, totally.

460
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,490
All right. Hey, look,
do your thing.

461
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,025
Keep going out there, getting
better. Practice makes perfect.

462
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,227
And when you're ready for me,
I'll go out, we'll shred together.

463
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,529
But no more tardies. Ok?
No more skipping school.

464
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,231
And, you know, no more lying.
All right? You got that?

465
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:30,766
I got it. But hey, no
more reading my emails?

466
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:31,567
- All right.
- All right.

467
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:33,934
We will definitely not
read your email anymore.

468
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:35,769
Tommy? Oh, my gosh.
Where have you been?

469
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,203
Hey! How are you?

470
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:41,974
It's so good to see you
again. Oh, my goodness. Hey.

471
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,498
You may be a better surfer
than me, Laird Hamilton,

472
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,332
but it looks like you're
having a hard time

473
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,165
finishing up that
cold cut trio.

474
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,098
What's the matter, partner?
You slowing down?

475
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:58,600
- No, I'm just taking a break.
- Well,

476
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:02,470
That's what you said
18 inches ago, my man.

477
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:05,806
I happen to know that you haven't
even opened your chip bag yet.

478
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,341
You know what's inside my
chip bag, Laird Hamilton?

479
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:11,578
Other empty chip bags.
Oh, yeah!

480
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,080
Hey, I'm just getting
a little dizzy right now, ok?

481
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,982
You want to quit?
Just say,

482
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,118
"Gary Brooks, you're better
than me, Laird Hamilton.

483
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,219
- I quit."
- I'm fine.

484
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,657
Great. Let's move on
the the santa fe chicken

485
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:27,426
in the footlong size
right there.

486
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,760
Ok.

487
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,830
But just so you know, no
matter what happens right here,

488
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,998
Gabby's coming home with me.
