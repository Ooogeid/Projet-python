1
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:07,068
How was your blind date?

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,171
I waited in the coffee shop for an hour.
She never showed.

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,693
Were you wearing that shirt?
She was there.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,773
I'm dropping off the kids.
Hi, Mitch.

5
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:20,248
Nice shirt. You wanna rent scooters
and drive around the island?

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,662
That's a fun game.
Make fun of the trained killer.

7
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:26,474
We'll see how that one turns out.

8
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:28,603
Look, Gary,

9
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:32,283
Tom took a career aptitude test today.
Now, when he tells you about it, just

10
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:34,191
don't have a disappointed look
on your face?

11
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:36,415
Like the one I had in
our wedding photos?

12
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,919
More like the one I had
on our wedding night.

13
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,510
Sheck it out, dad.

14
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:45,571
We took this test at school that tells
you what you should do for a living.

15
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:49,168
Mine said I'd be perfectly suited
for a career in the service industry,

16
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:53,352
like waiter, a bartender,
or guy who hands ice to the bartender.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,673
Don't worry about this test, Tom.
I took this test in high school.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,460
I don't even rember what I got on mine.

19
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:02,291
Construction and maintenance,
with an emphasis on painting.

20
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:06,832
And you obviously got
people skills. Why...

21
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:11,205
But I think it's great. I mean,
how often do you get to know exactly

22
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,505
what you're gonna do
for the rest of your life?

23
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:16,131
And if one of those jobs
comes in a uniform,

24
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:18,171
my decision-making days are over.

25
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:22,212
 What happened to the kid that
wanted to be a scientist or an archaeologist?

26
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:25,071
I don't know. The kids are bombarded
with all this career stuff at this age.

27
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:28,151
I think it's just his way of,
you know, handling the pressure.

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,562
But the important thing is is
that we don't overreact to this, OK?

29
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:34,068
So you go talk to him
while I go home and cry.

30
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,333
Is this better?

31
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,974
Tabascos of the world button-down.

32
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,035
I like it, Mitch.

33
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:49,876
I gotta go. Bye.
Hey, guess what, dad.

34
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:53,249
My dance partner and I got chosen
for the recital in my hip-hop class.

35
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,363
- Great.
- Hey, I love hip-hop.

36
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:58,626
When I was stationed in Afghanistan, a
few of us tried to get a crew together.

37
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,582
We called ourselves jala-bad.

38
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:04,409
- Can uncle Mitch take me to practice?
- It's fine with me.

39
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:05,832
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

40
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,926
You're not really going
to wear that shirt.

41
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:11,165
- I'm not that popular as it is.
- Go.

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,686
-= 201 =-
"Gary Has a Dream"

43
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,909
VO By :  ¤Aka¤

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,042
Team Subs-Addicts"

45
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:27,833
Hey, I think I'm leaning towards waiter.

46
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,756
Did you know they call
this "marrying ketchups"?

47
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:34,682
I now pronounce you heinz and hunt's.

48
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,527
You may kiss the fries.

49
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:40,622
That's really funny, Tom.

50
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:46,189
Don't let that test dictate what you're
gonna do for the rest of your life.

51
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:49,134
You always had such big dreams. What
happened to the kid I knew that wanted

52
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:52,074
to be a veterinarian or
a rocket scientist?

53
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:55,676
Or you wanted to be a biologi... that's
enough with the bottles now, please!

54
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:58,060
Come on, Tommy.
You gotta snap out of this.

55
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:01,043
You could do so much more than what
that test is telling you, Tom.

56
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,149
If there's something else you really
are into, you should go for it.

57
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,935
- Pursue your dream.
- Was it your dream to become a painter?

58
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:10,438
No. Painting was a way to pay the Bills,
but, you know, it wasn't my dream job.

59
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:11,857
So what did you wanna be?

60
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:16,312
I always wanted to have my own a.m.
Sports radio show.

61
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,436
I even had a name for it.
Check this out.

62
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,737
I'm Gary Brooks, and this is the score.
We got dodger Tom Callin' in.

63
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,879
He's mad as heck.
Maybe it's because he's a waiter.

64
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:30,247
That's really cool.
I never knew about that.

65
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,623
- So why did you give up on your dream?
- Excuse me? No, sir.

66
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,840
I did not give up on that dream.

67
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:40,135
I'm out there every day hoofin' it,
tryin' to make that dream happen, Tom.

68
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:42,470
Really?
How?

69
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,470
I watch sports on Tv all the time,
right? That's valuable research.

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,732
So that's how you're trying
to make it happen?

71
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,377
- I do other stuff, too you know.
- Like what?

72
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:54,265
Get off my back, Tom, all right?!
It just so happens

73
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,626
I was gonna call my friend Curtis down

74
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,522
 at the a.m. Radio station
down in saugus, OK?

75
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,190
What's up? Yeah, look,
I was wondering if there was any,

76
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:07,869
opportunities for me, you know,
we talked about it once...

77
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:09,867
Down there at the...
At the radio station.

78
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:13,969
What?
There is?

79
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,686
You're kidding me, right?

80
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:19,493
No you...
No you know this is Gary Brooks, right?

81
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,411
Yeah. I could do that. That's great.
Good. Great. Thank you very much.

82
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:28,591
I'm supposed to go down to the station
today and talk to his boss, Tommy!

83
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:30,702
That's how you do it.
You get a dream,

84
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:33,484
keep it in your heart and your head,
and you make it happen for yourself.

85
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,768
This is unbelievable.

86
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:37,796
You know, to be honest,
I thought you were full of crap.

87
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:39,278
So did i.

88
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,959
Uncle Mitch, I want you to
meet my dance partner, Bradley.

89
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,595
Hey, Bradley.
'sup?

90
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:48,439
Bradley is the best
dancer in our whole class.

91
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:51,675
His dad teaches
danceandmovement at Berkeley.

92
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:53,906
Well, that would explain it.

93
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:56,374
- I'm gonna go stretch out.
- All right.

94
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,712
So Louise says you're a marine.

95
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:02,779
She didn't tell you I was decorated?

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,858
- That's weird.
- My dad doesn't like the marines.

97
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:10,780
Well, this is America,
and your dad's entitled to his opinion.

98
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:13,363
- He's anti-war.
- Terrific. Good for him.

99
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:17,642
He says our national anthem should
be called the star-spangled bummer.

100
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:23,259
Let me ask you a little question there.

101
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:28,133
Who do you think it is that provides
your dad with the freedom and protection

102
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:30,380
to prance around Berkeley
and actually make a living

103
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,303
teaching a class called "movement"?

104
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,232
Who do you think that is?
Think that's the marines, Bradley?

105
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,779
Yeah, I think it's the marines.

106
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,858
Do me a favor, Bradley.

107
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:45,580
When you get home tonight, ask your dad
what language he'd be speaking right now

108
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,804
if the American soldiers who stormed
the beaches at Normandy

109
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:51,540
had decided to be anti-war like him?

110
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,145
Can you do that for me, Bradley?

111
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,943
Sprechen sie deutsche?!

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,047
- Were did bradley go?
- He ran away.

113
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,591
I told you not to wear that shirt.

114
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,373
Ty cobb, babe ruth...

115
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,691
These guys were no saints.
And now,

116
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:17,481
with all the steroids, you're gonna
make an example out of Pete Rose?

117
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:21,138
In 10 years,
Pete Rose will be in the hall of fame.

118
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,668
You could bet on it.

119
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:25,147
Yeah. I know who'll take that bet.
Pete Rose.

120
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,126
How you doin', man?

121
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,425
I'm doin'good. I'm real excited
about this. This is great.

122
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:32,527
- You got a call on line 2.
- Nobody knows I'm here.

123
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,733
Not you. Him.

124
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:36,407
Hey, you lookin' sharp today, man.

125
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:37,744
Not you. Him.

126
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:41,439
Look, I'm Kinda nervous
about meeting your boss.

127
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:44,239
Hey, if things go south,
just pretend to hyperventilate

128
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,743
like you did when Stephanie Sheitel
caught you cheating.

129
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:49,273
Yeah. You can't argue with
a guy who's hyperventilating.

130
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:52,000
Unfortunately you can put
a brick through his windshield.

131
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,465
- I'll walk you over to Sasha's office?
- OK. What's...

132
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,165
- What's this girl Sasha like?
- You know, grew up rich.

133
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,618
Daddy owns the station.
Doesn't know much about radio,

134
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:04,345
but she has a smarty-pants, Fancy degree
so watch out for the S.A.T. Words.

135
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,551
And make sure to mark your orange juice
in the fridge, or she will drink it.

136
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:12,843
I gotta tell you this means a lot to me.
Thank you.

137
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:16,729
If I get a job here at a radio station,
it's a new life, it's a different world.

138
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:19,768
Have a seat,
and i'll tell Sasha you're here.

139
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,819
My buddy's here to talk
to you about painting the station.

140
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,726
OK, Curtis, you can send the guy in.

141
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,852
All right, thank you, Paul.
I'll get back to you on that.

142
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:38,127
Hi. Thanks for seeing me.
I'm Gary Brooks. Hello.

143
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,449
Hi. Sasha Warden.

144
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:47,451
You come very highly recommended
from Curtis, Mr. Brooks.

145
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,980
I've known Curtis a really long time,

146
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,041
ever since we played football
together for...

147
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,633
Fighting toreadors of Jefferson high!

148
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:58,967
You know, the toreadors last year,
they finished their season 8 and 1.

149
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,810
Of course,
their only loss was on astroturf.

150
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,858
Thank you.

151
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,936
That was...
Weird.

152
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,959
So, how much experience do you have?

153
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:14,390
None, really, but,
I watch sports all the time.

154
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:17,313
- I talk about sports constantly.
- I don't see how that's Germane.

155
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,773
It's Germane.
It's incredibly Germane, crazy Ger...

156
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:21,749
Are you using the word the right way?
Germane?

157
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,357
All right, so,
do you have your own crew?

158
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,487
You mean like a posse? No.

159
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:30,002
It's not my style.
I'm more of like a one-man type thing,

160
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:33,133
but I'm open to bringing in a Sidekick
if there's good chemistry.

161
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:35,638
OK. Well, we should talk about color.

162
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:37,836
I only like whites.

163
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,314
Excuse me?

164
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,732
Whites, they're just
better in the workplace.

165
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,242
You know, they're...

166
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,444
They're brighter.
They're more positive.

167
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:54,769
Yellows, yellows are OK,
but definitely no darks.

168
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:58,287
Are you serious?

169
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,686
- Is that a problem for you?
- Yes, that a problem for me.

170
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,871
It's a big problem for me.
Does Curtis know about this?

171
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,513
I'll run it by him,
but we don't have a lot of time.

172
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:09,528
I would like the station painted by
the end of the month if that's possible.

173
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:13,594
What?

174
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,993
I would like it painted
by the end of the month.

175
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,174
Is that unrealistic?

176
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,830
No. It's not unrealistic at all.

177
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,854
It's just right now,
I really wish you were a racist.

178
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,821
OK, so maybe you can't see
yourself pursuing a career in

179
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,587
sewing or painting or photography, but

180
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,650
but have you ever considered the
fascinating field of medicine, Tommy?

181
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:45,474
I mean, look at this very, very
graphic photo of syphilis. All right.

182
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,333
Actually I was thinking if
dad's gonna be on the radio,

183
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,361
maybe that's something I could do, too.

184
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:53,591
You know, we can have our own show.
We could call it

185
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,229
dos amigos locos.

186
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,762
Hey, how did it go?
Did you get the job?

187
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,620
I got a job, son.

188
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:06,370
What misunderstanding it turns out they
wanted me to paint the radio station.

189
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,311
- That makes sense.
- But it's a good job.

190
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:14,018
It's a month of work. It's a 2-story
building. It's gonna take a while.

191
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:16,639
I'll make some good money.
The point is I went for my dream.

192
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,189
I went for it. That's what you
should take away from this, OK?

193
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:22,415
I guess, but maybe some
dreams are just unrealistic.

194
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:26,429
You're 15 years old. You don't know
where your life's gonna go, OK?

195
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:28,571
Dad, come on.
Let's face it.

196
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:31,507
Guys like you and me don't have
jobs like being on the radio.

197
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:34,037
We listen to the radio
while we're at our jobs.

198
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,065
Well, this is great.
I mean, he's less motivated than ever.

199
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,525
And why would he be motivated?
I mean, look at me.

200
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:45,418
I'm surrounded by a virtual graveyard of
things I've tried and lost interest in.

201
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:48,754
Why'd you look at me when you said that?

202
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:52,646
Look, I don't know how I'm gonna
do this, but I'm gonna get on the radio,

203
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:55,269
and I'm gonna show my son
that dreams do come true, OK?

204
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:57,491
How in the world did
we ever create Louise?

205
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,112
It's a fluke, but it happens.

206
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:01,562
The munsters,
they had that pretty daughter.

207
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:03,791
I'll see ya, grandpa.

208
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:10,867
Sorry I'm late. I was doin' the Moonwalk
on the way over here,

209
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,907
and I just kept gettin' further away.

210
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:16,818
- What are you doin' out here?
- Bradley won't dance with me.

211
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,004
And if I don't have a partner,
i'm out of the recital.

212
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,564
Why won't he dance with you?

213
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,974
Well, it's because of you, uncle Mitch.

214
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:23,864
Me?

215
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:26,774
Yeah. You scared him the other day,
and now he won't even talk to me.

216
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,792
He called you a warmonger.

217
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,010
He did?

218
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:33,566
He meant it in a bad way.

219
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,943
- I'm gonna to talk to him.
- Wait. Wait.

220
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:39,349
You're not going
to threaten him, are you?

221
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,473
I've got something even more...

222
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:44,167
Wait. Did you say, "threaten"?
Yes. That's what i'm gonna do.

223
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:47,557
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

224
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,438
Had to give Louise's dance
partner a little history Lesson.

225
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:53,314
Turns out he actually knows
more history than I do.

226
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:56,051
It's kind of frustrating,
but I still made him cry.

227
00:11:58,508 --> 00:11:59,726
There is Sasha.

228
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:03,445
Time to turn on the old Brooks charm
and get myself on the air. Nice.

229
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,122
So where are you from?

230
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,556
- Virginia.
- You a hokie?

231
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,822
Hokies!

232
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:20,354
- I don't know what that means.
- Virginia tech. Hokies.

233
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:22,812
You guys finished
15th in the country last year.

234
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:25,612
Actually I went to oberlin.
I don't think we had a sports team.

235
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:28,737
- Yeah, you did. The Yeomen.
- Fightin' Yeomen!

236
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:32,298
Curtis, will you make sure
this fax goes through?

237
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,851
I've got a lunch meeting.

238
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,841
Hey, wait, wait. Listen.

239
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:38,949
OK, I'll be honest with you.

240
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,478
Little mix-up.
When I came in here for a job,

241
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,850
I thought I was comin' in for a job
as an on-air sports guy.

242
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,972
That's why I was wearing a suit
and that's why I was talking like this

243
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,059
the whole time.

244
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:50,693
How embarrassing.

245
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:53,748
Felt like a complete idiot
sitting in there.

246
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,795
No. I mean for me.

247
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:02,677
I know it's asking a lot, but... I Kinda
told my son I was gonna be on the air.

248
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,954
You could help me out.
I'll go in. I'll read a commercial,

249
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:08,193
just a call letter, something, just
anything at all. You can help me out.

250
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:10,441
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.

251
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:14,460
And please don't ask again.
It's very uncomfortable for me.

252
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,355
I'm sorry, man.

253
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,028
I didn't know you were talkin'
about on-air work when you called.

254
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,937
That's OK, Curtis.
I just heard what I wanted to hear.

255
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,813
I got so excited at the thought
of Tommy hearing me on the radio.

256
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:29,743
Let me take you out for a burger. I'm
sorry. I just feel bad about all this.

257
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,378
Don't you have to stay in the booth?

258
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,164
No. We got a prerecorded show.
I can skip out anytime I want.

259
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,472
Then let me go in there read something.
I could read a commer anything.

260
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,595
- I'll read the call letters.
- I don't know, man.

261
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:42,386
- I don't know. I stand with Sasha yet.
- Let me tell you something, Curtis.

262
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,619
I never told you this before,
but it's time you know.

263
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,828
When we were in high school,
coach willis told me,

264
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:49,398
"sorry, I'm cuttin' your friend Curtis
from the football team."

265
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:51,544
And I told coach Willis,
"if you cut Curtis,

266
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:55,355
you lose your star quarterback, Brooks."
I stood up for you, man. You owe me.

267
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:57,113
Is any of that true?

268
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:59,338
Yes. Coach willis was
our football coach.

269
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,562
- All right, man. Get in here. Come on.
- Yes! Are you serious?

270
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:07,297
Mitch, call Tommy.
Tell him to put on the radio.

271
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,588
Callin' Tommy!

272
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,994
Here. OK,
you can do the dodger wrap-up.

273
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,860
Just read what's on the paper
and talk into the mike. Got it?

274
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:18,196
Yeah. OK,
is there anything else I should know?

275
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,797
- You're on.
- What?! Now?!

276
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,976
No, I'm just messin' with you, man.
I'm playin'.

277
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,100
Don't do that. That's horrible.
That's not funny.

278
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:26,112
I'm gonna count you
in from the engineer booth,

279
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,038
and when I point to you, you're on.

280
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,581
I'm Gary Brooks,
and this is the dodger wrap-up.

281
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,721
Matt Kemp homered for the second game
in a row to help the Dodgers

282
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,007
sweep the Cardinals

283
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,297
and extend their lead
in the national league west to 5 games.

284
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,915
So that's what the Dodgers are doing.
Let's move on to the WNBA.

285
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,503
They've decided to attract
more fans by dropping the "W."

286
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,503
And moving on to hockey,
everybody still hates hockey.

287
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,369
WNBA?

288
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:16,335
Hockey? I told you to read
what was on the paper.

289
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:18,245
What is wrong with you?
I'm probably fired.

290
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,071
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be funny.

291
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:22,610
I'm just messin' with you, man.
I'm just messin' with you.

292
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,689
Hey, man. Hey, that was hilarious, dude.
You're a natural. You did great.

293
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,843
- Thanks.
- Hey, we got a call.

294
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,986
Hello. KPPQ.

295
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,170
Sure. Hold on.

296
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:34,933
It's your son.

297
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,746
You wanna take this call on the air?

298
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:38,301
Are you kidding me?

299
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,089
Oh, my gosh.
This is literally a dream come true.

300
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:45,100
Push the caller button
when I point to you. Hockey.

301
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:49,901
Oh Boy.

302
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,532
Move it, mister.

303
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:00,305
I'm 235.

304
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:02,784
What are you, a buck?

305
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:04,387
Buck-o-5 tops.

306
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:07,545
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

307
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:09,131
Now get out of the way!

308
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:14,196
Get out of the booth now.

309
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:18,028
My son's on the line. Let me just take
this one phone call. I'll be done.

310
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:19,776
You do, and you're fired.

311
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,080
Welcome back to dodger wrap-up.
I'm Gary Brooks.

312
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,221
We got a caller on the line.
We got Dodger Tom in Santa Monica.

313
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:34,831
How you doin' there?
What'd you think of the game last night?

314
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,465
It was good. Dad, you're on the air.
How cool is that?

315
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:42,454
That was Dodger Tom with an interesting
take on the game last night.

316
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:45,596
This has been Dodger wrap-up.
I'm Gary Brooks,

317
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:47,947
and I'm on the air!

318
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,324
This is pretty much the last of our
stuff. I'll be out of here in 5 minutes.

319
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:55,625
- Thank you.
- Look.

320
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,026
I don't know who you're planning
on hiring to, finish the job,

321
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:01,586
but here's the business card
of a guy I could recommend.

322
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,080
This is your card.

323
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,545
I could start right away.

324
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,137
- Good-bye, Mr. Brooks.
- Look, Sasha,

325
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:13,715
the only reason I did what I did is
'cause my son came home from school

326
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,883
happy to be a waiter
for the rest of his life,

327
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:19,045
I just wanted to get on the radio to
show him he could shoot for something,

328
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:21,507
he could be more than what
I amounted to be.

329
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,202
That's the only reason I did it.

330
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:24,498
That's nice.

331
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,418
You know, my father never
cared about inspiring me.

332
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,386
I had to beg him for a job
in the family business,

333
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:31,828
and he stuck me here

334
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:35,836
in this nothing radio station
where if I screw up, no one'll notice.

335
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,219
Now I feel bad.

336
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,490
- Am I still fired?
- Of course.

337
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,736
I feel bad for me growing
up with a heartless father.

338
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,822
You gonna be OK, man,
losing this job at the last minute?

339
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,940
You kidding me? The economy's booming
right now. I'll pick something up.

340
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,244
I just feel bad. I...

341
00:17:57,253 --> 00:18:00,648
Like that time when stephanie
sheitel caught you cheating.

342
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:02,735
Yes. Yes, that's right.

343
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:05,858
That was horrible.
But this is much worse.

344
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:10,996
- What's going on? Are you OK?
- He's hyperventilating.

345
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:14,058
It's what happens when he thinks his
whole world is falling apart around him.

346
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:16,594
- Is there something we can do?
- You got a paper bag or something?

347
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,514
- Here. No, I got a purse.
- Gimme the purse. Gimme the purse.

348
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:21,721
OK. That's not working.

349
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:24,729
Should we call an ambulance?

350
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,922
No, but he just needs to hear
a little bit of good news right now.

351
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,730
I'm going to aspen for Christmas.

352
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:35,960
Good news in his life.

353
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,451
Fine.

354
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,585
He can stay and paint the station.

355
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:44,152
- Thank you. Let's get that burger.
- All right.

356
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:50,796
Thank you.

357
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:53,303
You know, I don't ask for a lot,
Mr. Brooks.

358
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,029
Just stay away from the microphone
and either get a belt

359
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,512
or pull up your paints
when you're painting the baseboards.

360
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:04,415
You've earned that.

361
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,584
Hey. Look who I found.

362
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:12,930
Dad, That was awesome.

363
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,482
My friends were listening.
We're, like, famous now.

364
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,209
I thought we had pretty good chemistry.

365
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,268
What do you think about
a show called dos amigos locos?

366
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:24,493
"Two crazy friends."
Who wouldn't listen to that?

367
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:27,978
Hey, Tommy, you want some free
stuff from the radio station?

368
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,937
Sure.

369
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,747
How about a pair of underwear that says,
"speak into the mike"?

370
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,428
I'm really proud of you, Gary.

371
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:45,255
Tommy is so excited.
I mean, you finally got on the radio.

372
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:46,511
You know?

373
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,624
I remember you talking
about that dream once.

374
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:51,717
Although at the time, I think you
were just trying to get into my pants.

375
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,769
I be honest with you. That was probably
one of the greatest moments of my life.

376
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:57,345
Getting in my pants?

377
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,674
No, getting on the radio.
Getting on the radio wasn't easy.

378
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:08,929
Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
You didn't seem that hard yourself.

379
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,306
We'd been drinking all day
at the barbecue, rember?

380
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:24,243
I'm sorry about Bradley.
I really thought he'd listen to reason.

381
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:26,925
- Are you ready to do this?
- Semper fi.
