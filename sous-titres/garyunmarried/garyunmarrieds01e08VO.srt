1
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:05,462
Thank you for finding my cell phone.
I was looking every where for it.

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:08,005
Yeah. I called you to tell you,
but you didn't pick up.

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,258
19 messages?

4
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:12,705
Yeah. I thought maybe there'd be,
like, a reward involved,

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,500
so I just kept hammering away at it.

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,467
Listen.

7
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:19,851
Now that we agreed to start seeing other
people, are you seeing other people?

8
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:22,809
- Do you really want to know that?
- Yeah, I want to know that.

9
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,380
I don't want to know that.

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,816
You know, I've got some worse news.

11
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,615
You know that party you were
going to have at my bar on sunday?

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,799
Yeah, the annual Gary's
housepainting party.

13
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:36,011
That's where I drum up all my business
by kissing all my clients'butts,

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,326
So why did you say
like it's not happening?

15
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,822
- Because it's not happening.
- What talking about? It's next sunday.

16
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:45,425
Somebody came in, and he reserved
the whole bar for a private party.

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,402
I reserved the whole
bar for a private party.

18
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,491
Yeah, but he put down a credit card.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,459
You put down a fiver.

20
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,944
Hey, kids. All right.

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,440
Who's ready for 2
straight days of nonstop,

22
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:02,351
in-your-face laying around and
doing nothing and probably lots of math?

23
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,962
Louise, honey,
please make sure something

24
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:08,024
intelligent happens
here this weekend, OK?

25
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:11,638
I'm like Jane goodall, mom.
I'm only here to observe the apes.

26
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,574
Hey, Vanessa.
I didn't expect to see you here.

27
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:21,166
You guys... you back on?

28
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,492
Why would you say that?
Are you breaking up with me?

29
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:28,003
- Thanks a lot, Allison.
- What? What? Wait. Wait. Wait.

30
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,625
You guys are teasing me. Great.
OK. Good. Very nice.

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,200
Very nice. Thank you. I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.

32
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:38,555
Bye, Gary.
I'm sorry about your party.

33
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:41,486
Yeah. You, too.
What party?

34
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:44,728
What party? The annual Gary's
housepainting party. Remember?

35
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,718
God, I am so glad I don't have to
have that party at my house this year.

36
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:49,971
Can I have that party
at your house this year?

37
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:52,739
- What? No.
- Please. Please, come on.

38
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,679
All the contractors think you're hot,

39
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:58,068
and all the interior decorators
think you're... fabulous!

40
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:03,473
- Please.
- OK, under one condition.

41
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:05,243
No. I hate "one condition."

42
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,862
Look, you have to go with
me up to big bear next weekend.

43
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:09,920
Beth and Jim are renewing
their wedding vows.

44
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:13,817
No, I don't. Because you got Beth
and Jim in the divorce.

45
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:15,218
I got the corn holders.

46
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,299
You mean donna and PJ.?

47
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,872
No, not the kornholters.
The actual corn holders, the little

48
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:25,623
mini corn that you plug
into the regular big corn...

49
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:27,732
- Corn holders.
- Gary, yeah, I got it. Look.

50
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,998
You have to go. I mean, Beth is one
of our oldest and dearest friends.

51
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:33,782
Oldest and dearest friend? What are
you talking about? Every time you guys

52
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,607
are together, you just backstab
each other and bicker and fight.

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,478
That's what girlfriends do, Gary. Jeez.
You don't know women at all, do you?

54
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,038
Look, Gary,
we were in their original wedding party.

55
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,233
I mean, if we don't go,
it's gonna send a message

56
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,583
we no longer are interested
in their happiness.

57
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:51,593
I'm Gary Brooks,
and I approved that message.

58
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:58,585
All right. Well, good luck having
your party here.

59
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,200
I hope your guests enjoy their
hot pockets and frosted flakes.

60
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,890
All right. You know what?
You win. OK. I'll go with you.

61
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:09,878
OK. Good. Good. I will pick
you up at 5:00. Don't be late.

62
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,410
Have your bag packed.
And for god's sakes, don't wear shorts.

63
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,828
I hate when your legs
sweat all over my car seat.

64
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:19,058
- Didn't we already take this drive?
- What?

65
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,324
For, like, 15 years?

66
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,552

Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]

69
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:39,384
This is a nice room. You know, if mine's
not this nice, we're gonna switch.

70
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,934
- About that.
- Hey, what are you doing?

71
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:48,480
I told people. They know I'm here, and
the ex-wife is always the first suspect.

72
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,075
Gary, I don't want you to overreact,

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,081
but I need you to do something for me,
and you're not going to like it.

74
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,354
All right, but we got to go really
fast because I want to get in the pool.

75
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:03,683
You say "really fast" like you
do it any other way. So, I mean...

76
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:07,588
No, we...
we have to share a room.

77
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:09,816
Really? Why?
Are they all sold out?

78
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,877
Beth and Jim and everyone
here still think we're married.

79
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,904
- Good-bye.
- No, come on. Come on, Gary.

80
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,005
- What?
- You know my relationship with Beth.

81
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,176
I can't have her gloat all weekend about
how she's still married and I'm not.

82
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,976
OK. Hi. She is still married,
and you're not.

83
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,487
I'm leaving.

84
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,198
Alli, are you in there? It's Beth.

85
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:33,256
Hang on, Beth!
Hey, Gary, honey, let go of me!

86
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:35,835
I'm trying to answer the door!
Please, Gary.

87
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,344
Look, if you do this, not only can
you have your party at my house, but

88
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:45,149
I will cook, and I will flirt,
and I will guarantee you 6 new jobs.

89
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,244
- 8. 8. 8.
- 6. 6. 7.

90
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,978
- 50.
- What? No. Fine.

91
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:51,180
Fine. Fine. 8. Fine. 8. But...

92
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,933
But remember,
we're madly in love, OK?

93
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:55,669
And we're

94
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,501
totally into each other and we can't
keep our hands off each other, OK?

95
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,836
I thought we were supposed
to act like we're married.

96
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,444
You guys,
what are you doing in there?

97
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:08,033
Just coming. Hang on.
OK, here. Do you...

98
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,942
Promise to pretend

99
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,024
- to be my husband?
- I do.

100
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,256
It's so nice when dolphins meet.

101
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,604
Look at you, gorgeous lady.

102
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,240
Me gorgeous?
Look at you. You look great.

103
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:36,958
You have lost almost
all your baby weight.

104
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:40,463
Thanks. Louise is 11.

105
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,492
Yeah, you look fabulous, too.

106
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,538
Looks like you've really been enjoying
life, you know, out there in the

107
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:47,988
wind and the sun.

108
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:52,950
- So, Gary, how's the painting business?
- It's going good.

109
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:56,958
Actually, I just signed
a contract to get 8 new jobs.

110
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,150
Could you stop?
Just stop doing that...

111
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,830
Because it's turning me on so much,
and I don't...

112
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:05,705
I don't want be tired at the party from
all the sex we're going to be having.

113
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:08,408
Right. Well, listen,
everybody's down at the bar.

114
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,888
So why don't you two
come join us down there after

115
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:14,176
- you've had a chance to... settle in.
- Way in.

116
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,926
- You reckon?
- Yeah. You got it, sweetie.

117
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:28,449
Our Molly is in every gifted
class the school has to offer.

118
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:30,040
We are so proud.

119
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,328
That is great. You know, our Louise
is in every gifted class, too.

120
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,208
Did I tell you she was
contacted by NASA?

121
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,935
You mean that flyer
she got from space camp?

122
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:42,228
They don't just give them to anybody.

123
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:45,401
I thought they did. It was on our
windshield after a dodgers game.

124
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:50,659
Hey, you sexy man, would you
go get us another round of drinks?

125
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:53,632
- God, yes. That's a good idea.
- Thank you, gar bear.

126
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,657
You're welcome, all-batross.

127
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,540
You know, I'll go with you.
I'll be right back honey.

128
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,654
No, I don't think...

129
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,040
Okey-dokey.

130
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,394
Stuart, you guys couldn't
get out of this thing either?

131
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,819
No, but my wife had to agree
to let me have a weekend

132
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:22,990
in Vegas by myself,
no questions asked.

133
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,017
All right.

134
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:27,018
I got a lecture about how
I'm Lucky to have anything at all.

135
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,242
Hey, guys, look who showed up.

136
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,115
Boy. Leslie Martin.
She looks great.

137
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,445
Probably because she's divorced.
She and glen split up last year.

138
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:40,592
She looks even better than imagine
her when I'm having sex with my wife.

139
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,499
You know what I'm going to do, guys?
I'm going to do something I did

140
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:48,830
not have the nerve to do 15 years ago.
I'm going to go over just,

141
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:51,577
there and stand there and not say
anything until it becomes so awkward

142
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:53,344
that she finally says hi to me.

143
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:05,234
Gary Brooks.

144
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,937
Hey, Leslie. I didn't even see you here.
That's crazy.

145
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,573
- It's been forever.
- Hey, sorry to hear about you and glen.

146
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:14,183
You know what I miss
most about being married?

147
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,953
- What?
- Absolutely nothing. Divorce awesome!

148
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,314
- That's great.
- How's Allison?

149
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,554
- Who?
- Your wife, Allison.

150
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,739
We split up...
the driving

151
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:27,586
on the way here. We split it up.

152
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,217
She... she drove to riverside,
and then I took over.

153
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,053
I'm glad you're here.
You want to buy me a drink?

154
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,695
- They're free.
- Just like me.

155
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,179
Poor Gary. So nice of him
to talk to Leslie like that.

156
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,831
Can't imagine anything
more sad than being divorced.

157
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:51,513
I don't know. What about throwing
a party in honor of yourself maybe?

158
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,332
Look at him,

159
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,946
staring into her eyes and hanging
on every little word she says.

160
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:03,896
Yeah. Well, that's my Gary.
He's a great listener.

161
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,903
Looks like he'd like
to listen her brains out.

162
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,594
This is ridiculous.
You're making me wear pajamas?

163
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,783
Is it OK that I'm going commando,

164
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:18,974
or should I go back
and put on some pull-ups?

165
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,625
I'm going to watch some Tv.

166
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:27,446
What's the matter, Allison?

167
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:28,764
- Nothing.
- Really?

168
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,838
Then why are you doing
that angry page-turn?

169
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:32,830
I don't know what you're
talking about, Gary.

170
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:35,030
- Then what was that?
- Coupon.

171
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,037
OK. As long as nothing's wrong,
I'll drop it.

172
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,913
- Nothing's wrong.
- OK. Great.

173
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,211
What the hell was with you and Leslie?

174
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,167
- I knew it.
- Everybody knew it, Gary.

175
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,911
You were flirting with her all night.
You're supposed to be married.

176
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,248
- Are you jealous?
- Of course not, Gary.

177
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,596
I just don't want
you to blow my cover.

178
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:55,857
I mean, admit it, you were, like,
in full-on flirt mode, with the

179
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:59,079
dancing and joking
and chewing with your mouth closed.

180
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:01,318
I mean, when was the
last time you did that?

181
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,481
I'm surprised you even noticed
any of that. I mean, were

182
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,440
spending the whole time trying
to one-up Beth. It was embarrassing.

183
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,804
One time you told her
tommy has no cavities.

184
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:14,688
Well, he doesn't.
And their son, Joey, Braces. Yeah.

185
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:19,850
Look, Gary, the point is,
please, would you stay away from Leslie?

186
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,700
- You took a vow.
- I didn't take a vow. I took a deal.

187
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:26,680
Look. You know what? If you still
want to have your party at my house,

188
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:28,670
you have to remember
you and I are married.

189
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,108
You know what? I don't know
how you managed this, Allison,

190
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:34,799
but somehow being married to you this
time is worse than it was the last time.

191
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,815
I'm going to the vending machine,
and I'm going to get ice.

192
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:40,994
And I'm only making one trip.
So if you want anything,

193
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,141
you got to tell me now.
Do you want anything?

194
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,477
You want some pretzels?
You want, like...

195
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:48,104
A nutter butter or something?
Some cheese crackers?

196
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,749
Peanut butter crackers?
You want, like, a Kit-kat,

197
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:52,898
Snickers, Beechnut gum?

198
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,220
Maybe... All right.

199
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,615
- Bring me something with coconut.
- Too late.

200
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,137
Hey, Leslie. Hi.

201
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,493
I'm just going to get ice.

202
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:11,509
Some inconsiderate person
just took the last of it.

203
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,875
- Your bucket's all full.
- I know. It was me.

204
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,164
I hear good things
about your son's teeth.

205
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:31,022
Allison thinks i'm at the ice machine.

206
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,400
The machine's empty.
We've got 20 min, a half-hour tops.

207
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,392
That's great.
I can do it, like, 5 times.

208
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:41,080
- Wait. Hold on a second. This is crazy.
- I know. It's so wrong. I love it!

209
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:43,872
No. I promised Allison
I would be faithful this weekend.

210
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,459
Just this weekend?

211
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:48,361
Yes, which is ridiculous, because
I just broke up with my girlfriend, so

212
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:50,852
- this weekend would have been perfect.
- You have a girlfriend?

213
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,200
Had. I had a girlfriend.
Now I don't have a girlfriend.

214
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:55,394
So I'm not really cheating on anyone,
except my wife.

215
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,862
- Get on the bed.
- OK. I'll get on the!

216
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:03,217
It's OK.
This bed should have a warning track.

217
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,136
Why can't you ever
remember your key, for...

218
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,525
- Hey, Beth. I thought you were.
- Gary?

219
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:16,874
- Yeah.
- I'm not.

220
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,445
Well, yeah. I see.

221
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:20,488
Where is Gary?

222
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:23,133
He went to get me something
out of the vending machine.

223
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:27,067
That's nice. I bet he's getting
a little something for himself, too.

224
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:30,993
Hey, let's go see Leslie. It'll be fun.

225
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,490
What happened here?

226
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:40,080
It looks like 2 people with
ice buckets crashed into each other.

227
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,586
I wonder where the bodies are.

228
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:46,741
I can't do this.

229
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,930
Yes, you can.
You're good at it. Trust me.

230
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:52,896
No, I can't. I'm jeopardizing the thing
that's the most important to me.

231
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,930
Of course.
Your marriage.

232
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,120
No. This party I'm having sunday night.

233
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:02,181
Leslie, yoo-hoo. It's Beth and Allison.

234
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,661
- Hey, you guys.
- I've got to get out of here.

235
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:08,038
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing.

236
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,340
Just trying to sneak some guy
out of my room.

237
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:13,416
Why would you say that? That's cra...
you're being sarcastic. That's good.

238
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:15,370
OK. I have to go.

239
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:22,142
You know what?
Maybe we should just leave her alone.

240
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:25,329
It sounds like she's with someone.
Did you hear a man's voice?

241
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,793
Hey, you guys. What's up?

242
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,628
We just wanted to
see what you were up to.

243
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:36,011
Well, Beth did mostly. I was in bed
when Gary got up to get some ice...

244
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:37,963
Cream sandwiches.

245
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,862
You haven't seen him, have you, Leslie?

246
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,303
There he is.

247
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:52,941
- Gary, I thought you were...
- Getting snacks for Allison? I was.

248
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:54,583
You're covered in leaves.

249
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:58,148
Wicked leaf fight with the best western
across the street. We kicked their ass.

250
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:01,733
- Well, good night, you guys.
- We're going to go make some love!

251
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:08,044
- Were you over in Leslie's room?
- Yes. I was waiting for ice to be made.

252
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:13,617
- What did you do, just out her window?
- I had to jump out a window.

253
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:16,827
I almost got caught red-handed
doing nothing wrong by my pretend wife.

254
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:19,595
Gary. Now Beth thinks there's
something wrong with our marriage.

255
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,448
Something's wrong with our marriage?
I'm always the last to know.

256
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,513
What do you care what Beth thinks?
She's a creep, that lady.

257
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,770
- She's like a comic-book villain.
- Beth is the one person

258
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:32,460
who, from the beginning,
said that we wouldn't make it,

259
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:35,768
and we didn't. OK? I didn't want to give
her the satisfaction of being right.

260
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,157
- You're kicking me out?
- Yeah, Gary,

261
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,327
and just like the last time,
you're asking me if I'm kicking you out.

262
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:44,977
My gosh. Easy.

263
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,428
I can't believe you, Gary.

264
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,140
I asked you to do one
tiny thing this weekend.

265
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,639
You couldn't do it.
I knew I couldn't count on you.

266
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,430
And just as I did 15 years ago,

267
00:14:56,555 --> 00:15:00,170
i'd like to repronounce
Beth and Jim husband and wife.

268
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,070
Where's Gary?

269
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,281
He had to leave late last night.
One of his paint trucks exploded.

270
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:12,085
It was horrible, but beautiful...

271
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,442
But horrible.

272
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,319
Thank you for coming, everybody.

273
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:22,473
We're so happy you were
able to share this with us.

274
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:25,008
And I know some of
you have been asking.

275
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,685
Yes, this is the same
dress I wore 15 years ago.

276
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,082
For god's sakes.

277
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,353
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- What are you doing here?

278
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,599
I'm here to let you know
I'm not going to let you down.

279
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:43,441
You know what? Forget it, Gary. There's
nothing you can say to make up to me.

280
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,163
Really? Could I have
everybody's attention, please?

281
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,865
- What are you doing?
- Gary, you snuck in.

282
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,324
You're pretty good at sneaking around.

283
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:56,545
Beth, remember when you
were cheerleading in college and

284
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,258
you always wanted to know who was that
hit you in the face with that peach?

285
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:03,475
Well, I'd like to come clean.
It was a nectarine.

286
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,469
But watching Beth and Jim Renew
their vows has really

287
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,312
inspired me, and I would like
to Renew my vows

288
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,139
- with Allison right now.
- No, no, we wouldn't.

289
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,002
We're real good. Allison.

290
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,240
- Look, I can't stand you.
- I can't stand...

291
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,197
Here and act like

292
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:24,008
the times that we've spent together
haven't been the best, because

293
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:25,838
- they have.
- I will kill you.

294
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,961
And Allison would kill me if

295
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:31,531
I didn't mention the fact that our house
is amazing. She keeps it immaculate.

296
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:33,605
And we have our 2 beautiful children.

297
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,421
Tommy, of course,
with his mouthful of flawless teeth,

298
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:37,854
and

299
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:41,123
flight commander Louise H. Brooks.

300
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:45,433
- Shove a sock in it.
- You know, the Russian poet

301
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:46,714
shovasockinit,

302
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:48,590
he,

303
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,375
he said love, like vodka,
should flow freely between

304
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,825
2 lovers. And that's what it's
like with me and Allison.

305
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,753
And I know when we first got together,
some of you were doubters, Beth,

306
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:06,145
and... but here we are.
We're still here.

307
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,320
We're still married. We're still
very much in love. And Allison,

308
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,038
if I've done anything
to disappoint you, even

309
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,971
something recently,

310
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:17,882
i'm sorry, and I just...
I won't let you down.

311
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,697
That's all I got.

312
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:23,918
They want us to kiss.

313
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,336
Yeah, I should have
thought this through more.

314
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,918
All right. Let me handle it.

315
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,594
Everybody.
We're divorced.

316
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:36,972
What?

317
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:39,378
It has been 7 wonderful months.

318
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:42,394
In fact,
I am already engaged to a doctor.

319
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,716
So... i'm sorry.

320
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,287
I didn't want everyone
to know about me and Gary.

321
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,264
But now that you do,

322
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,893
- the truth feels good.
- Allison, you're divorced?

323
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:55,694
I'm so sorry.

324
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:00,594
- We're divorced, too.
- Oh my god!

325
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,820
I wasn't supposed to say that.

326
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:05,849
We still sleep together
on occasion, though. You know...

327
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:12,501
I probably wasn't supposed
to say that either.

328
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,093
Anyway, thanks, Allison.

329
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:17,494
We're in therapy.

330
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:22,938
We're not divorced, but things
are looking pretty bad right now.

331
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:25,773
Thank you, Allison.

332
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:29,735
Would everyone please stop
thanking Allison for being divorced.

333
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,532
I thought we all knew each other
enough that we didn't have

334
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:35,155
- to lie about who we are.
- I'm gay.

335
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,648
I'm sorry. I came out
to Beth about 6 weeks ago, but,

336
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,455
we still love each other, aénd

337
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,007
we had already paid
for all the floral arrangements...

338
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:57,222
Which I designed.

339
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:00,491
And

340
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:04,272
Beth is dealing with this new and
exciting chapter of our lives. And...

341
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:07,085
come on.
How many of you aren't surprised?

342
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:13,568
Jim, would you help me
outside for some air, please?

343
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:17,534
Honey. Listen, everybody the bar's open,
OK? And we'll be right back.

344
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:20,703
And also... i am dating a doctor.

345
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:28,731
- Well...
- Well, good for him.

346
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,937
Hey, you didn't have to come here
and rescue me, you know.

347
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:36,954
I wasn't here to rescue you.
I was here to fulfill my marital duties.

348
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:38,622
Plus...

349
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,448
i hate when people pick on you.
I always have.

350
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:44,211
What are you talking about?
You did for 15 years.

351
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:46,484
Yeah, but I'm, like, really good at it.

352
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,175
Let's get a drink.

353
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:54,147
So...
The Russian poet Shovasockinit?

354
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:56,203
Yeah. You know,

355
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,580
his muse was his wife, Oftenisabitch.

356
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:15,140
- Gary, we got a 3-hour drive.
- All right.

357
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:21,969
We're leaving.

358
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,811
Yeah. Me, too. I just want to get back
home and put this all behind me.

359
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:27,721
Pretty crazy weekend.

360
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,581
So, I hear your daughter
is in the space program.

361
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:35,540
Yeah. We're very proud of her.

362
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:55,141
Hey, Gar. I'm gonna be in the car.
I'll see you in 5 minutes?

363
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,056
