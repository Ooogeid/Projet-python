1
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:04,092
Look, your father is going to hang
those in your room tonight.

2
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:06,093
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

3
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:09,040
Gary, would you please tell them they
can use these activity boards I bought?

4
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:11,452
Use your activity boards
that she bought.

5
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,865
Yes but Dad,
tell her I'm too old for this.

6
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,456
Tom is too old for that.

7
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:20,703
Can your turn off the Tv, and show a
little interest in your children's life.

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,142
Tell your mother I'll show interest
in your life when there's a commercial.

9
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,640
You're watching a commercial.

10
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:29,187
Hey, when Billy Mays yells, I listen.

11
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,824
Gary? Gary,
I need you to hang these boards.

12
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,812
They're a great motivator
and will help keep the kids organized.

13
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,512
Why do they need these boards here?
Don't they have them at your house?

14
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:43,458
That's the point. It's all part of
my household continuity project.

15
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:47,447
Does that fall under the umbrella of
your "ruin Gary's life" initiative?

16
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,243
No, I already finished that.

17
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:53,009
I came in ahead of schedule
and under budget, thank you.

18
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,299
I know, I know. No, Gary.
I read a book on this, OK? Continuity

19
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,053
between homes makes transitions
Less Jarring for children of divorce.

20
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:02,828
Do you guys Feel Jarred?

21
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:07,104
Any other imaginary emotions
you want to pin on me?

22
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,943
Guys, why don't you just go
put those in your rooms, OK?

23
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:12,330
How am I supposed to play
you two against each other

24
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,352
if both my houses are equally lame?

25
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:19,075
Dad, Ms. Plummer said that she's going
out with you again tomorrow night.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,903
Ms. Plummer said that
in front the class?

27
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,894
No, she told me in private.

28
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,198
Dad, please don't mess this up.
I have her for one more year.

29
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:29,175
I don't want to get a bad grade
just because I have your eyes.

30
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,342
Gary, i'm gonna need a key 'cause
I'm gonna be coming and going a lot.

31
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,649
- What?
- What? Since I broke up with Walter,

32
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:39,257
I finally have the time to make
this place work better for the kids.

33
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:42,182
No. You cannot have a key.
See, when I moved out of the house,

34
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:44,801
I kind of under the impression
I wouldnt have to see you as much.

35
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:47,194
That's how the judge sold
me on the whole divorce thing.

36
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,206
I wouldn't have to do
any of this at all if you

37
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,855
and the house weren't
a constant work in progress. I mean,

38
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,052
seriously when was the last time
you did anything to fix this place up?

39
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:57,623
You're right, Allison. But, you know,

40
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:00,430
I was gonna surprise you with this,
but since we're talking about it,

41
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,911
I'll show you. I did something
to spruce the house up.

42
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,848
But it's outside. Let me show you.

43
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,271
Just go to the... That's much better.

47
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:23,234
I don't know, Gary. I've got to get up
pretty early in the morning.

48
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,275
- I sure had a good time, ms. Plummer.
- Well, Gary,

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,439
you've got to stop calling me
Ms. Plummer.

50
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:32,025
- You're not one of my students.
- I can't help it.

51
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:36,017
Like the incomparable David Lee roth
says, I guess I'm just hot for teacher.

52
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,853
- I'll stay for one drink.
- Attagirl.

53
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:43,620
That's the spirit and, you know, and
I don't know if you know this or not,

54
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,190
but this is our fourth date,
and I think there's some kind

55
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:50,325
of law that something's supposed
to happen after a third date.

56
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,167
I'm pretty sure that's not a law.

57
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,208
I'm pretty sure it is a law, you know,

58
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:59,283
and I've gotten out of jury duty
7 times. I know a lot about the law.

59
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,585
So I get the feeling you like me.

60
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:06,848
I wouldn't have sat through a two-hour,
one-woman show if I didn't like you.

61
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:09,670
Come on. You've got to admit,

62
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:12,384
Shirley Maclaine
as had a fascinating life.

63
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,160
Yeah, it was fascinating.
I just wish her one-woman show

64
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:17,487
was performed by a bunch
of guys throwing a football.

65
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:21,284
Well, you were a very good sport.

66
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,063
I was, wasn't i?

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,702
- Hey, Gar.
- Hey, Joan.

68
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,448
- Allison, I... We just were, Hey.
- Don't worry about it.

69
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:34,899
I've seen Gary attempt to
kiss other people before.

70
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:38,078
- What are you doing here?!
- I told you about this.

71
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:40,015
I found bookcases for Louise's room that

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,842
are exactly like the ones at my house,
and i'm just putting them together.

73
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,413
- Go! Come on! Get out of here!
- Well, I just...

74
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:47,829
Soon as I get my carrot
muffins out of the oven.

75
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:51,249
And, Gary, the kids can have as many

76
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:53,957
of these as they want because
they're made with oat flour

77
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:56,281
and flaxseed and they're sweetened
with applesauce.

78
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:59,562
That's not a bad idea, you know that?

79
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:02,232
And I like what you're
saying about the flaxseeds,

80
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:05,285
so you're really speaking
my language on that one.

81
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:07,571
I think I should probably go.

82
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:10,328
No, no. Hey, I don't want you to go.
I want her to go.

83
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:13,114
She's over here all the time ever
since she Broke up with Krandall.

84
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,258
Yeah, but, Gary, she's obviously
trying to keep busy

85
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:19,296
because of the breakup.
She really needs your support right now.

86
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:20,952
I'll support her tomorrow.

87
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:23,714
I mean, we already
supported Shirley Maclaine.

88
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,681
How many crotchety old bags do
we have to prop up in one day?

89
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,118
Besides, I don't know if you know this,
but you were just 3 min away from 2 min

90
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:32,375
of ecstasy.

91
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:38,336
Sometimes the anticipation of the event

92
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:41,342
is more exciting than the event itself.

93
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,836
So my reputation
as a lovemaker precedes me.

94
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,454
Hey, Gary,
you got to taste these muffins.

95
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:59,089
The rest of your coffees
will be right up, Mr. Brooks.

96
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,883
Thanks, Lindsay. Remember Lindsay?
She baby-sat Tom and Louise?

97
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:06,996
Here you go. 8 quadruple-shot mochas.
Good luck on your murder spree.

98
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:11,306
It's for my paint crew.
We're painting a second story today.

99
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,296
After this, they won't need ladders.

100
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,429
Can't we just go back to
our regular coffee place?

101
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:20,581
This place creeps me out. Look.

102
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,358
They have pitchers of cream.

103
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,695
Call me old-fashioned,
but cream should be powder.

104
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,377
Well, Joan took me to this
place on one of our first dates.

105
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:33,407
She says that coffee tastes better if
you enjoy it in a place that's classy.

106
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,221
I'm classy, too.

107
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,090
Excuse me.
Other people are waiting here.

108
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,380
Yeah, but they're
keeping it to themselves.

109
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:46,893
Burn.

110
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:51,444
Yeah, I know how fascinating
stirring is to you painters,

111
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:54,118
but, could you finish it
at the job site, please?

112
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:57,108
That's amazing.
You guessed it. Did you

113
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,682
as a child dream of becoming
a coffee-shop job-guesser?

114
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,937
Double burn.

115
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,473
That guy makes me Ms. Krandall. At least
Krandall kept Allison out of my hair.

116
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:13,516
Maybe should find Allison another guy.
You know anybody could set her up with?

117
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:17,085
That's impossible. Any guy worthy of
Allison is already in prison or hell.

118
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,603
Smoke alarm! Fire! Fire!

119
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,286
Oh, my gosh! Tom! Louise!
Wake up! There's a fire!

120
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,192
Fire! Fire!

121
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,427
Allison, get down from there.
There's a fire.

122
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,297
Gary, that was just me. I'm changing
all the batteries in your smoke alarms.

123
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:44,270
- What time is it?
- It's 6:30.

124
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:47,942
Congratulations, Allison. This is the
earliest I've ever been pissed at you.

125
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,243
Gary, I'm sorry, but I have a spin class
at 7:00. It was the only time I had.

126
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:55,868
How do you get in here?! What, do I got
to put steel wool around the drainpipes?

127
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,333
That's a good idea.
I forgot all about that.

128
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,144
When are you gonna be done?

129
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:04,024
Well, as soon as we get
your life in order, so, no time soon.

130
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:14,952
Are you absolutely sure this is
the best way to get Allison a date?

131
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:16,828
Yeah. It's how I sold my waterbed.

132
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:28,344
That was a really tiny lesbian.

133
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:33,552
Mr. Brooks,
you can't put this in the window.

134
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:36,782
We have a pretty strict policy
against human trafficking.

135
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,338
All right.

136
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:42,076
Look, Lindsay, we're all against
human trafficking, but

137
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:45,600
that's Allison. There's probably a gray
area here somewhere, right?

138
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:47,341
All right.

139
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,864
This is great.
I'll never get rid of Allison now.

140
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,665
Why don't you just go to Ms. Plummer's?

141
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,711
- Can't. She has cats.
- What's wrong with cats?

142
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:57,497
I can't get naked in front of cats.
They bat things that dangle.

143
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:08,719
Looks like you're stuck in there
forever, unless you want to push.

144
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,414
Well done.

145
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,964
I would have figured it out without you.
I'm sorry I took that away from you.

146
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,716
I know how much you people
enjoy your little victories.

147
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:22,186
That guy's just like Krandall.

148
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:25,228
- Hey, he's just like Krandall.
- That's what I just said.

149
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,772
No, you could set him up with Allison.

150
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:30,455
You're right.
But I can't talk to that guy.

151
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:33,206
He's mean, he hates me, and he's spooky.

152
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:35,555
Just like Allison.

153
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,695
- Why don't you go talk to him, man?
- You're right.

154
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:44,422
- What are you reading?
- "Archaeology today."

155
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,299
Well, that's kind of weird.

156
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:49,322
Today, archaeology's about old stuff,
but it's today.

157
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,335
Yes, I suppose it is
a bit of an oxymoron.

158
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,126
You don't have to call me names.

159
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:59,204
Look, I think you and I got
off on the wrong foot and,

160
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,946
I'd like to maybe start over.
Let me ask you a question.

161
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:04,961
Are you, are you single?

162
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:10,413
- We're still on the wrong foot. Bye.
- I know. No, not for me.

163
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:14,332
For my ex-wife. See, she's single and I
think you guys would really hit it off.

164
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:16,325
You guys would be perfect together,
seriously.

165
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,281
Look, I'm flattered and,
more than a little frightened.

166
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:21,934
But, I'm not gonna go out
with some woman who...

167
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,694
Good god! She's stunning.

168
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,568
I just think you guys
would really hit it off.

169
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:29,154
You have so much in common.
You're smart. She's smart.

170
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,652
You're an archaeologist.
She's bony.

171
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:37,230
- You know what? I'd love to meet her.
- Great. You won't be sorry, initially.

172
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,059
Are you,
you're sure we have enough in common?

173
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,920
Here's your coffee. Anything else?

174
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:45,220
Yes, I'd like a carrot muffin and,

175
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:48,355
now, can you tell me, is that made
with oat flour and flaxseed?

176
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,290
I hear wedding bells!

177
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,325
Oh, my gosh. I totally forgot
we had a date. I'm sorry.

178
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:00,573
We don't.

179
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:04,578
All right, good. I say that all the time
anyway to be safe. Come on in.

180
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,554
So, what's going on?

181
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,875
Well, I just ran into a friend who gave
me two tickets to see

182
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:13,887
- "Don Giovanni."
- That's cool. Who's he fighting?

183
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,824
No, it's an opera, and I got box seats.

184
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,619
That's terrific.
You want to meet up afterwards?

185
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:24,478
Come on, Gary.
It'll be fun.

186
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:28,000
We can get all dressed up and stop
for a glass of wine on the way,

187
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:31,348
and then go see a great opera.

188
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:34,918
Is that the one
"kill the wabbit" is based on?

189
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,096
You're thinking of
"flight of the Valkyries."

190
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,138
I promise you i'm not.

191
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,713
So will you go?

192
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:48,992
Yeah, I think I'll go. Besides,

193
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:52,169
you know, afterwards,
we can come back here, and

194
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,145
that third-date rule
that's been dogging us,

195
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,335
we could probably figure
out the answer to that

196
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,322
'cause I don't think
Allison's gonna be here.

197
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,721
Why, because you killed her?

198
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:05,810
No. No, I think I found
the guy for Allison.

199
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:08,916
He's great. He's smart.
He's an intellectual.

200
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:12,261
I mean, he corrected my grammar
several times. Did you know that "Ravel"

201
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:13,879
means the same as "Unravel"?

202
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:17,969
You don't have to say the "un" at all.
I've wasted so much time.

203
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,173
I wish you would have told me that

204
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:24,349
you were looking to set Allison up
with someone. I know the perfect guy.

205
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,829
No, no. Here, sit.
This is the perfect guy.

206
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,323
I took his picture.
That's him right there.

207
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,073
His name is Edward.

208
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,879
What do you mean, "huh"?
You don't seem "thused."

209
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,994
Gary you can't do that with every word.

210
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,539
See, look.

211
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:51,368
Listen, there's this dad at school who I
think would be much better for Allison.

212
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:52,769
Do you know Andy Russell?

213
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:55,134
Yeah. The guy that runs
the spring carnival?

214
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,239
If you really want to set Allison up
with someone, I think you want Andy.

215
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,952
What the hell's this?

216
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:09,018
- I found it tacked to a telephone pole!
- What?

217
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:10,895
5 of the tabs are missing.

218
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,739
Actually, don't get ahead of yourself.
Only 3 are missing.

219
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:16,400
I had to pull 2 to get the ball
rolling so you didn't look desperate.

220
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,484
You said yourself you have
too much time on your hands since

221
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:27,635
you broke up with Krandall, and I've
noticed. You're taking it all out on me.

222
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,088
So you decided just to post
my picture around the city?

223
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:33,321
What are you, nuts? I already got
a call about a bachelor party!

224
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:37,247
If you have the kids that night,
I'll take'em.

225
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,585
All right.
Look, I was just trying to help out.

226
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,367
In fact, I think I found the perfect
guy for you at the coffee shop.

227
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:45,305
Well, but if he isn't,
I know somebody who might be.

228
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,106
OK, look, Joan, I'm sure
your intentions are good and, Gary,

229
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:51,464
I would ask what you're thinking,
but that implies that you can, so...

230
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,512
Allison, give me a break. It's just
I think you're kind of in a rut.

231
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,915
I'm sorry.
I am not in a rut, Gary.

232
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,812
If I want to meet a guy,
all I have to do is put on my red dress,

233
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:03,952
blow out my hair, and shake my cookies!

234
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:07,874
God, Gary! How dare you assume that just
because I've been spending days

235
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,427
and days here laying shelf
liner and hanging shoe trees

236
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:13,499
and making cubbies for the kids'
school that somehow I am unfulfilled?

237
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,646
All right. Send your top two picks
to the coffee shop tomorrow, OK?

238
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:21,341
No druggies, no fatties.

239
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:31,666
Is that your phone?

240
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,381
It's OK. I'm a doctor.

241
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,064
Yes, nurse. What is it?

242
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,984
- It's Lindsay.
- Lindsay, why are you calling me?

243
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,695
I'm so busy right now.

244
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,314
Because you promised you'd
pay me 20 bucks to call you

245
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,605
and tell you how
Allison's dates are going.

246
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,721
- Why are you whispering?
- I'm at the opera.

247
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,259
Are you painting it?

248
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,040
No, I'm not painting it!

249
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,201
Excuse me.

250
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,913
All right,
so what's going on over there?

251
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:02,742
Her date's going really well.

252
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,881
She's been sitting with
this guy for a long time.

253
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,343
Is it the carrot muffin guy?

254
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,554
Muffin man was shot down really quickly.

255
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:14,913
She's with more of a...
Jelly-filled-donut kind of guy.

256
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,606
Really?

257
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:19,957
They've been sitting here for two hours.

258
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:21,829
They're talking. They're laughing.

259
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:23,788
Thanks, Lindsay.

260
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:28,521
Good news. Allison found her man.

261
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,994
- It's Andy, isn't it?
- Yeah. How did you know she'd pick him?

262
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,786
Well, your guy was too perfect.

263
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:38,235
Women don't want someone who's
all finished. They want a fixer-upper.

264
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:43,926
That's ridiculous. Who would want a
fixer-upper when you could have Edward,

265
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:47,243
- a guy who's in move-in condition?
- Because it's no fun.

266
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,695
They want a guy who they can fix
up exactly the way they want them.

267
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,402
Fix their hair, fix their clothes,
you know, introduce them to new stuff.

268
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:01,942
New stuff li coffee shops,
one-woman shows, and the opera?

269
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,628
- What?
- Oh, my god, I'm your fixer-upper!

270
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,743
Now I'm in trouble.

271
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:10,515
Thank you. It's over.

272
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:16,131
It's just intermission.
And you are not my fixer-upper.

273
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:20,686
Sure, I am. I can totally see it.
Don't you see? I mean, for 15 years,

274
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:23,238
I was with a woman that all she wanted
to do was change me...

275
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,111
How I acted, how I behaved,
what I wore, the way I looked.

276
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:28,742
She was at my house this morning
trying to fix the way I live.

277
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,404
I can't do that again. I'm sorry.
I have to be me.

278
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,868
Yeah, but did it ever occur to you that
I was just trying to show you some of

279
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:38,503
the things that interested in so that
you could learn a little bit about me?

280
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:41,123
Sure that's how it starts but next
thing you know, I'm taking, like

281
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,408
ballroom dancing classes,
i'm learning another language,

282
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,676
i'm buying cheese from a store
that only sells cheese.

283
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:47,415
Where does it end? At the opera.

284
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,539
So, then, why did you even say
that you would come with me?

285
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,039
Because I thought it would led to sex.

286
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,443
You only came to the opera to get sex?

287
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:00,558
That's the only reason any guy goes to
the opera. What, do you think these guys

288
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,263
running around the theater.
That guy wants to be at the opera? No.

289
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:05,825
You think that guy wants
to be at the opera? No.

290
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:08,549
All right, these two guys,
they want to be at the opera.

291
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:10,815
I think we should just go.

292
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,691
Something's telling me you're not
dying to see how the story ends.

293
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:16,086
It's in French.
I don't even know how it begins.

294
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,304
- It's Italian!
- 'cause I speak Italian, right?

295
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,605
So, that went well.

296
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:29,702
Just get my bag so I can go home.

297
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:30,907
Sorry.

298
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:34,060
Why'd you leave your bag at my house?

299
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:36,642
Because I thought I was going
to be spending the night.

300
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,256
Tonight was the night you were gonna
sleep over, and I totally blew it?

301
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,336
Oh, my gosh.

302
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,604
You know, you look very pretty tonight.

303
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,403
- Get... my bag!
- Right. Sorry. Sorry.

304
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:59,032
Here you go. Look. Let's be honest.
I sat through half of the opera.

305
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,792
That's... I get nothing?

306
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:05,680
There. We're even.

307
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:10,396
Thanks.

308
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:21,678
- Hey, Gar.
- Why wouldn't you be here?

309
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,831
I've been drinking coffee for the past
two hours. I'm completely wired.

310
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:29,588
So I thought I'd come over
and finish up a couple things I started.

311
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,772
What happened to your date with Andy?

312
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,175
Yeah, that's over.

313
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,018
What do you mean it's over? I thought
you guys were really hitting it off.

314
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,436
We were, we were.

315
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:40,510
We were talking. We were connecting.
W were making plans for tomorrow

316
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:43,484
and I suggested maybe we could have
lunch, you know, get some coffee,

317
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,120
get some new clothes,
maybe get a haircut for him, you know.

318
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,265
I don't know.

319
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,606
Contact lenses? Look for a better condo?
And then he gets up,

320
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:53,323
he goes to the bathroom, and I never
see him again. Just don't get that.

321
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,766
You don't get it?

322
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,050
You don't get it? You just met the guy,
and already you want to change him?

323
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,210
What is it with you people?
It's like an addiction.

324
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:04,315
Look. I don't want to change him.
I you know, I want him just to be the...

325
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,180
The best damn andy he can be.

326
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:11,254
Why do women always want
to change guys and fix them up

327
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:13,828
and make them like new things?
You know where I just was all night?

328
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:16,105
I was at the opera.
Joan took me to the opera!

329
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,449
Were you painting it?

330
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,363
I wasn't painting it. I wish I was
painting it. I had to sit through it.

331
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:26,044
So what, Gary so what if she was
trying to help you learn and grow?

332
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:28,545
Want know what's wrong with that?
It's annoying that's why.

333
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,416
You know, I'll tell you what's annoying,

334
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,569
is when a guy has potential
and he won't let me work with it.

335
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:34,903
OK. You know what?

336
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,182
I, for one, don't want to be worked on.

337
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,361
Gary, you are never gonna get into
a lasting relationship if you're afraid

338
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,710
- to open yourself up to new things.
- What about you?

339
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:45,063
You're never gonna hang onto
a guy if you keep nagging him

340
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:47,332
to change stuff
that he doesn't want to change.

341
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:51,770
Gary, what if...
What if we both keep chasing people off?

342
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:54,456
You know, eventually,
we're gonna be the only two left.

343
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:58,452
We're gonna get back together,
aren't we?

344
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,628
You know what?
Don't say that. That's terrible.

345
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,573
Oh, my god.
OK. You know what? Either

346
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:05,353
I've had too much coffee the thought
of that just given me a heart attack.

347
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,820
Just calm down.

348
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:10,397
Allison, next time you go out with
a guy, just don't try to change him, OK?

349
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,594
Yeah. OK, I won't, unless.

350
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,178
Unless, there's something glaring,
like a gold chain or something.

351
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:17,616
OK! You're right!
You're right! All right. I'll just...

352
00:19:18,994 --> 00:19:21,829
I will let them be who they are. OK.

353
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,853
And, Gary, you know what?

354
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:26,371
You can't be afraid to open
yourself up to new things, you know?

355
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,295
You're right.

356
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,795
You know what? Both of us have to start
cutting other people a lot more slack.

357
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:37,498
That might be the most grown-up
thing I think you've ever said.

358
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,135
Thank you.

359
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,403
Joan was here, and I'm still
a little revved up. You want to do it?

360
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:52,322
Nah, forget it.
I don't have 2 minutes, anyway. See you.

361
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,538
I wanted to talk to you about
the incomplete I got last night.

362
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:15,412
All grades are final.

363
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:17,733
I know I was a Jerk
and I was pompous and obnoxious...

364
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:18,767
Yes, you were.

365
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:21,195
- But I don't deserve a second chance?
- No, you don't.

366
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,346
But if you do give me a second chance...

367
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:25,482
I would love to take you
to see "Don Giovanni."

368
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,260
I want to know if Don Giovanni

369
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:31,061
is able to Lure Zerlina
away from her fiance Masetto.

370
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,602
Yeah, I can Google.

371
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:38,852
Well, aren't you afraid that I might
try and fix you up the way I want you?

372
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,267
Let's face it. I'm a tear-down.

373
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:44,350
Any repairs you want to
make is fine with me.

374
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:47,782
- Have you been to the ballet?
- Come on!

375
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:50,232
