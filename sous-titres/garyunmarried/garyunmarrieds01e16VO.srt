1
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:04,153
Don't go in the cellar!

2
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:06,653
Don't go in the cellar! No!

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:09,657
The name in the movies:
"Don't go in the cellar"

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,518
And there goes your head.

5
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:17,243
Stupid teenagers.

6
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:27,584
He's inside my house?

7
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:30,987
Oh, my gosh.

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,239
Louise, why are you practicing so late?

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,739
I'm sorry, dad.
I forgot this was your Tv time.

10
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:41,528
All right. Look, you know,
I got the premium package, I told you.

11
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:45,060
If I don't watch 5 hours of tv a day,
i'm throwing money out the window.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,920
I have to practice. Grandma and grandpa
are coming for my recital tomorrow.

13
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,966
- You remember my recital, right?
- Remember?

14
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,240
Are you kidding me?
I'm your Roadie, man.

15
00:00:56,526 --> 00:01:00,225
Sound check is at 11:00 sharp.
And sober, all right?

16
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:04,813
How come you didn't practice
this earlier, you know?

17
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,647
Well, I had choir practice after school,
then volleyball.

18
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:10,749
Then I had to study for my geography
test, and then I had my math tutor.

19
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:14,072
That's too much stuff, Louise. When
are you gonna take time to be a kid?

20
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:16,231
In my late 30s, like you.

21
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:23,036
I'd ground you for that, but then
I wouldn't have anybody to play with.

22
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,073
I'm gonna go watch baseball.
Play me out.

23
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,877
Charge!

00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:00,449
- I can't take this.
- Look, it's almost over.

28
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:04,499
Louise is gonna be playing.
Dear god. She's freaking last!

29
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,660
- I'm making a break for it.
- What?

30
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:10,391
Act natural. Be cool. Be cool.

31
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,313
Take a break.

32
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:15,926
Take a break.

33
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,035
Go back. Go back.

34
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,281
This concludes our concert.

35
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,222
I think all of your children were
simply marvelous, and I look forward

36
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:44,564
to seeing all of you at the next recital
at the mcmartins'house next week.

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
What?!

38
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:49,190
Should I bring? Ham?

39
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,515
Jello salad?

40
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:54,025
I'll start working on both.

41
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,682
Oh, my gosh. I don't mind listening
to my own daughter, but

42
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:04,516
3 hours of listening to other kids?
I was willing my appendix to burst.

43
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,078
I'll tell you one good thing
that came out of that recital.

44
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,019
I don't fear death anymore.

45
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:16,160
You've got a real prodigy
on your hands, Allison.

46
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:20,277
Please don't squander her
talents the way you did yours.

47
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:23,781
OK, look, mom, I was never going
to become an Olympic gymnast.

48
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:25,787
I have bad depth perception.

49
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,896
Fine. So gymnastics wasn't your thing.

50
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,232
But you were an excellent swimmer.

51
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:32,241
I was.

52
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,859
With your tiny breasts
and your huge feet,

53
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:37,465
you could glide through
that water like a little seal.

54
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:42,522
OK, look, mom, no one is
squandering Louise's talents, OK?

55
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:45,684
We both encourage her to
explore all of her interests.

56
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:48,913
Did I tell you she's starting
Mandarin lessons tomorrow?

57
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,903
What? You didn't tell me.

58
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:54,224
My granddaughter,
the concert cellist who speaks Chinese.

59
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:58,082
I can't wait to whip that one
out when my neighbor brags

60
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,855
about her blind daughter
who climbed everest.

61
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,855
Time out. Wait a second here.
Why does Louise have to take Chinese?

62
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,440
When the Chinese take over the world,
they're gonna teach it to us

63
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,642
all for free in the reeducation camps.

64
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:15,823
Louise is an exceptional child.
She needs to stay stimulated.

65
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:17,432
Yeah, but she's too stimulated.

66
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:21,134
You know, she's got volleyball
and cello and now Chinese?

67
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,646
I mean, she's pretty.
She doesn't have to be smart.

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,360
She's taking Mandarin.

69
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,963
- Maybe she's not.
- Maybe she is.

70
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,066
Maybe I'll pull out
the big gun on this one.

71
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,063
Please. What,
you're gonna pull out your veto here?

72
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:36,509
- Try me.
- What are you two talking about?

73
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,095
When we were in marriage counseling,

74
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:41,701
they gave us a tool to get
through deadlocks the veto.

75
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:44,805
You get one a year, it's ironclad,
and the other one has to honor it.

76
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:47,226
Hey, maybe we should.

77
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:51,987
Gary, think about this.

78
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:55,169
I mean, all the career opportunities
this could open up for Louise.

79
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,028
- A translator.
- Veto.

80
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,137
- Ambassador.
- Veto.

81
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:02,862
- International trade lawyer?
- Wait a second. What was that last one?

82
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,260
- International.
- Veto.

83
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,432
- The veto is finito.
- All right, fine,

84
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,547
- but that is your veto for the year.
- Great. Fine with me.

85
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:14,841
I would do it again if I had to.
Sayonara, Chinese.

86
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,438
- That's Japanese.
- I guess we'll never know, will we?

87
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:25,592
Hey, mom,
when is the recital gonna start?

88
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:28,066
It's over, Tommy.
You slept through the whole thing.

89
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,243
But I was here, so it counts, right?

90
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:33,289
Yes, you were here. You were here
and accounted for. That counts.

91
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,714
All right. I'm gonna go tell Louise
she was great. She was, wasn't she?

92
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,868
You know,
rather than focusing on Louise,

93
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:43,413
you might want to
spend some time on Tom.

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,178
Now, that's a boy that needs
to be interested in something.

95
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,924
Tommy's good at a lot of things.
He's got hobbies, you know?

96
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,564
He, he can fall asleep anywhere.
You know?

97
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,769
Hey, what about golf?

98
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,659
I was gonna play 18 holes
at rancho tomorrow, and I was

99
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:03,132
may I please play
18 holes at rancho tomorrow?

100
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,050
Hey, you know,
that's a great idea, Charlie.

101
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,367
Let's get Tommy interested in golf.
Can we play?

102
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:10,831
All right.

103
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:14,062
But no beer, no cigars,

104
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:17,083
and it wouldn't kill you
to walk the course.

105
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:21,133
If it would, i'd walk it.

106
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:25,741
Well, Tom, welcome to heaven on earth.

107
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,800
What makes you think
I'm gonna like golf so much?

108
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,639
Because every guy loves golf.

109
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,581
Hey, you're walking around
in the great outdoors.

110
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:36,386
- You're drinking beer. You're cussing.
- Yeah. I like the hell out of that.

111
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:40,021
- How about no cussing today?
- Can I have a beer?

112
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,548
So basically we're just
in the great outdoors?

113
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:44,911
Yeah. Have fun.

114
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:48,743
I'm just gonna sit over here
and study for my history test.

115
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,683
OK, Tom. I want you to bend your knees.

116
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:53,825
Keep your head down.

117
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:58,361
All right, eyes on the ball
and make sure you follow through.

118
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,045
Are you OK, dad?

119
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,132
No, I'm not OK!
The ball hit me on my neck!

120
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,706
Tom, you can't learn golf that quickly.

121
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:12,193
You got to keep trying.
Here we go. Try it again.

122
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:14,955
Here we go.

123
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:23,746
Sorry.

124
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:27,031
In 35 years of golf,
I have never seen anyone lose a shoe.

125
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,531
I guess I'm trying too hard?

126
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,783
Yeah, well,
that's the spin we'll put on it.

127
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:35,604
Now, from now on, what I want
you to do is to really concentrate

128
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,519
on keeping your feet planted.

129
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,468
Yes! I hit it further than Tom.

130
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,370
Nice shot, Louise.

131
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:50,666
I'd like to see you ricochet one off
the wall and then hit dad in the neck.

132
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:55,357
So, Louise,
why don't you try hitting another one?

133
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,155
- I lost it.
- It's not coming down.

134
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:11,773
I hit that sign. Sorry.

135
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,019
That's OK. That's just

136
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:17,613
put out there so people know
how far away 200 yards is.

137
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:21,089
So how long has
your daughter been playing?

138
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,875
Including today? One minute.

139
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,583
Don't beat yourself up over it, Tom, OK?

140
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,493
I know, but that guy seemed
really mad about his windshield.

141
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:37,619
Right. Look,

142
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,568
forget about it. He'll get over it.
Bentley, very common car.

143
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,893
Nobody learns golf and is good
at it on the first try. Nobody...

144
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:50,575
- Hey, look, Tom. Check it out.
- Stop showing off, Louise.

145
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,670
I'm still gonna get
my license before you.

146
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:55,817
You realize you have to
take a test for that, right?

147
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:57,167
A test?

148
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,431
I did it, Charlie.
I'm a golf dad.

149
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,953
You know, Tiger Woods bought his
paren a mansion and cars and trips.

150
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:12,175
I know I'm just the grandfather,
but, Louise knows I love her, right?

151
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:16,667
Listen, I've got to run this by Allison.
We got to get her into lessons.

152
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,298
Yeah, right. Allison. You know,

153
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:21,706
I don't think she's gonna
be quite as thrilled as we are.

154
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,013
Wait. Why not?

155
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,564
When Allie was younger, I tried to
get her interested in golf

156
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:29,726
by sort of, shoving it down her throat.

157
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,609
- She never told me that.
- Yeah, it ended kind of ugly.

158
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:36,209
I think it really peaked when she ran
away from golf camp down in Florida.

159
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:38,497
She was never the same
sweet little 9-year-old

160
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:40,620
after they pulled her out
of the everglades.

161
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,529
- No wonder she hates golf.
- And leeches.

162
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:50,833
God. She's got to go along
with this golf thing. I just...

163
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,787
I wish I didn't veto
chinese the way that I did.

164
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:56,063
Yeah, well,
you did lay it on pretty thick.

165
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,910
I love to torture Allison.

166
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,575
If only there was a way I could get
her to use her veto on something else.

167
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:08,184
- Wait a minute. What did you just say?
- I love to torture Allison.

168
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,234
No, after that.

169
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,944
I should get her to use
her veto on something else.

170
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,381
- That is a great idea.
- That's what I should do, right?

171
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,450
Good grief. What is that horrible noise?

172
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,248
Sounds like some nut on a motorcycle.

173
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,667
And it seems to be getting louder,
doesn't it?

174
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:33,687
- Was that Gary?
- Come on. He's in the garage.

175
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,880
Gary! What the hell are you doing?

176
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,207
I bought Tom a dirt bike.

177
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:48,124
OK, wait a minute.
So you bought our son a motorcycle.

178
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:51,134
You said get him interested in
something. He'll be interested in this.

179
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,836
Are you a complete idiot?
Dirt bikes are dangerous.

180
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:57,908
This is the single most irresponsible
act of parenting I have ever seen.

181
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,806
Boy, if I could,
I would veto the hell out of this.

182
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:03,586
Don't say that. Don't say that, Charlie.
Come on. Stay out of it.

183
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,505
This is about my son becoming a man, OK?

184
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,743
- No. Dad's right.
- Allison, please,

185
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,549
- don't use your veto on the motorcycle.
- Sorry. You know what? I have to.

186
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,074
- Hold on, dear.
- What?

187
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:17,728
Now, I can't put my finger on it, but
there's something weird going on here,

188
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:20,196
Gary and Charlie is doing
that bad acting thing

189
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,696
he does every time he wants
to get away with something.

190
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:25,657
What? Are you saying my concern

191
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:28,804
the well-being
of my grandson is just an act?

192
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:30,730
Well, how dare you!

193
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,422
All right, what's going on?

194
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,789
Why are you trying so hard
to get me to use my veto?

195
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:39,637
What? No, I don't want you to
use your veto on a dirt bike.

196
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:42,702
OK. All right. Fine.

197
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,887
- What are you doing?
- What?

198
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,865
You think Tommy should ride
a dirt bike, then that's what he'll do.

199
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,276
Good. Then you call him.
Get him down here.

200
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:58,332
- What's going on?
- Look what your dad got you.

201
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,730
- You bought me a dirt bike?
- You betcha.

202
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,279
- Mom, you're OK with this?
- Yeah.

203
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:07,214
If your dad thinks it's a good
idea, then it must be a good idea.

204
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:11,206
- Is it, dad?
- It's a real good idea, Tommy.

205
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,417
- Mom?
- Come on, Tommy.

206
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,111
Get up there. I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?

207
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:21,420
Having to learn how to type
with a pencil taped to my nose?

208
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,889
- Come on, Tommy. Jump inside.
- Yeah. Get on the bike, Tom.

209
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:28,471
All right. Look at you?

210
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,156
Look how great he looks up there, Gary.
Right?

211
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,208
- Why don't you start it up, sweetie?
- Yeah, Tom. Start your new dirt bike.

212
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:37,128
Be a man.

213
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:45,060
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- What? What? What?

214
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:47,674
What? Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid. Get back up there.

215
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,276
You know, I heard something weird
with the axle rows connector.

216
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:55,630
You can't ride this
until I get it checked out, Tom.

217
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:56,983
Thank god.

218
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,584
I don't know what's going on here,
but I don't like it.

219
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,615
Nothing, nothing is going on here,
Allison, OK?

220
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,047
The only problem with that motorcycle
it's not big enough.

221
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,570
I've got to buy him a bigger
motorcycle and a knife.

222
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:16,745
Am I the only one left sane around here?

223
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,462
Fore!

224
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,512
Nice.

225
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:24,881
- Louise, nice shot.
- Thanks, mom.

226
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:27,295
- That's my third one in a row.
- That's great, honey.

227
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:29,935
3 in a row. That is great.

228
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,539
- Veto!
- What?

229
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,052
- Are you vetoing paper cups?
- No. Gary, i'm vetoing golf.

230
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:41,149
That's what this was all about?
You want Louise to play golf?

231
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:44,354
I'm telling you. My daughter
is not playing that awful sport.

232
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:47,616
You've got to see how good she is. She's
phenom. She's amazing. Don't veto golf.

233
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:50,390
You know what? She would have
been really good at Chinese, too.

234
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,336
Come on. A billion people speak Chinese.
Why do you need one more?

235
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,210
Veto!

236
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:01,714
Please! Finally it's an activity
that I can enjoy with my daughter,

237
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,887
- something I'm interested in.
- All right. So

238
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:06,897
if it really means
that much to you, maybe I can veto it!

239
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:10,631
Allie, why don't you do it for me?

240
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,764
Let's not kid each other here.

241
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:15,497
I'm not getting any younger,
and I would love to see

242
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:19,873
my little Louise play golf
before the big guy signs my scorecard.

243
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:24,757
Please.

244
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,327
You'll die when i'm done with you.

245
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,415
That's it, Charlie.

246
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:41,677
It's the death of a dream.
I saw it all.

247
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,680
I saw little Louise playing
in the dinah shore classic.

248
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,247
On the 18th hole, she sinks a 30-footer.

249
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:49,929
The place goes crazy, and she looks
right into the camera and goes,

250
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,430
"that was for my dad."

251
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,749
And then

252
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:57,226
she tosses me the keys
to a brand-new saturn she won.

253
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,130
Look at me, Gary.

254
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:02,878
What do you see?

255
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,009
A guy with a mustache that's...
mostly nose hair.

256
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,036
Gary, it's you in 20 years

257
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:11,393
if you don't do something to change it.

258
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:14,827
Ghost of Gary future,
it's you I fear most of all.

259
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,136
Come on. Charlie, I'm sorry
I disappointed you, but it's the veto.

260
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:22,031
- It's the one thing we have to respect.
- Knot up, betty.

261
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:29,331
This is bigger than any
stupid little agreement.

262
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,903
We're talking about Louisa's
future. Look.

263
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,716
I bet you can't name
me one famous cellist.

264
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,230
- Yo-yo ma.
- You see? You see?

265
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,352
You see? Because there aren't any.

266
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:46,428
But you can rattle on, like,
famous golfers all day long.

267
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,405
And maybe one of those
names could be Lulu Brooks.

268
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:55,133
- Lulu?
- Lulu. See, it chants a lot better.

269
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,955
- Lulu.
- Hey, it's up to you, Gary.

270
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,668
I leave it up to you.

271
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:04,049
But when you're my age, do you want
to be looking back at sundays

272
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:06,586
spent in some stuffy old concert hall

273
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:11,508
or walking the links
of pebble beach half in the bag?

274
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,013
- Nice shot, dad.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

275
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:20,183
I still feel weird about
skipping cello practice.

276
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:23,096
Well, we all do things we feel
weird about that might be wrong.

277
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,138
After a while, that feeling goes away.

278
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:29,625
And if the feeling goes away,
was it every really wrong?

279
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,995
Great. Louise, why don't you go practice

280
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:40,017
some chip shots out of the sand trap?
And remember.

281
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:42,499
I know. Hit two inches behind
the ball and follow through.

282
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,521
Don't tell the boy,
but she's my favorite now.

283
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:54,513
- It's Connie.
- Don't answer it.

284
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,663
Don't worry. I got it covered.

285
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,112
Connie had me record Louise's
recital the other day.

286
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:02,072
Something about memories.

287
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:04,464
Hey, buttercup.

288
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,736
Just calling to see how Louise's
cello practice is going.

289
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:11,558
It's wonderful.
I'm so proud of our little Angel.

290
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:14,613
You should see her.
She's playing like a pro.

291
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:19,655
I am so happy you wanted
to go to Louise's cello practice.

292
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,027
It's not like you.

293
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:23,999
Well, it's the new me, buttercup.

294
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,251
You know, I think i'm gonna
be going to a lot of

295
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,821
Louise's practices from now on.

296
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,568
Put your hat back on.
You're not supposed to get sun.

297
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:33,144
All right. Thanks, dear.

298
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:36,860
We're dead.

299
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:38,761
What? Why?

300
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,894
Great.
It's the two horsemen of the apocalypse.

301
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,495
It was Gary's idea.

302
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:48,511
He told me if I didn't play along,
i'd lose my social security.

303
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:50,596
How did you guys find us?

304
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:53,683
Louise's cello teacher
called asking where she was.

305
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,313
Cello? Oh cello.

306
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:59,994
When you said take her to cello,
I thought you said take her to golf.

307
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:04,627
Mom said you guys would be out here
playing golf, and I said, "of course not

308
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,749
"because Gary would
never do that because I vetoed golf,"

309
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,946
and veto is the one thing
that we both respect, Gary.

310
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,048
How am I supposed to
ever trust you again?

311
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:19,344
What? I don't know what
you're saying. I'm sorry.

312
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:20,980
He thinks you're playing his ball.

313
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:24,301
I'm not playing his ball.
I'm playing my ball. Look. That's my...

314
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,310
I forgive you, Gary.
Come on, honey, let's go.

315
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,504
Time out.

316
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:54,967
I'm curious as to how my daughter is
fluent in a language that I vetoed.

317
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:58,356
I don't know. Kids.
What, did you pick it up off the street?

318
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:01,163
- They're like little sponges, you know.
- Yeah, time out.

319
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:02,654
Back it up.

320
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,925
Whatever happened to "Gary, the veto
is the only thing we have to respect"?

321
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,848
OK. I ignored your veto, OK?
But you ignored mine.

322
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:11,717
But you ignored my veto first.
My veto was finito.

323
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,704
- You didn't know that, so technically.
- Enough!

324
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:18,241
Who cares who did what first?

325
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:22,538
The point is, you should be celebrating
the fact that you both had a hand

326
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,219
in creating this incredibly
wonderfully talented child.

327
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:29,738
Well, you're right, Connie.

328
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,407
Thanks, mom.
That's a sweet thing to say.

329
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,018
I would have killed to have had
a child with a fraction of this talent.

330
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,454
- Get the clubs.
- Yes, dear.

331
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:46,046
Gary, I'm taking Louise to cello now.

332
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:48,675
You can pick her up at 1:30,
take her to volleyball practice.

333
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:51,482
And tomorrow she has debate before
school, so you have to take her early.

334
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:54,835
And then saturday i'm taking her to
golf from 7:00 in the morning to noon.

335
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,291
But be sure to pop in a Chinese
tape on the way to the course

336
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,383
so she'll be ready for her
wednesday night lesson.

337
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:01,821
Is it too late to veto
having a second child?

338
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,670
I'm kidding. What? She's enriched
our lives in so many wonderful ways.

339
00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:09,635
Come on, mommy. Grandma's in the car.

340
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,483
She says if we don't hurry up,
she's gonna go ahead and smoke.

341
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:13,929
Coming.

342
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:17,586
Well, Gary, it looks like
you may get to walk the links

343
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,008
of pebble beach after all,
there, golf dad.

344
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,859
Thank you. You know what?
Thanks for giving me the courage

345
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:26,035
to break that veto agreement, you know?

346
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,460
If only there was something we could
find for Tommy that he's good at.

347
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,222
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, son.

348
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,293
There's got to be
something he's good at.

349
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,904
