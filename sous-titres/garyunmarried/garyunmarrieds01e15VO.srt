1
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,849
Everything's gonna be okay, right?

2
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:06,637
I mean, buisnesses get audited
all the time, right?

3
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:12,095
Arthur wants you to relax,
Quit looking over his shoulder,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,678
and go order us some dinner.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,180
What do you have ESP?
You got that all from a look?

6
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,137
We're second cousins, man.

7
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,908
I'm telling you, son,
you gotta go down to Mexico yourself

8
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,368
and hide out until this
whole thing blows over.

9
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:28,165
You gave me that same advice when they
told me I had to repeat third grade.

10
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:32,998
OK. But if things don't work out,
and you need a new identity,

11
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:36,017
I got an x-acto knife
and a laminator in my van.

12
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,333
This is the only box of receipts
for Gary's painting

13
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,377
I could find at my house.
I hope it helps.

14
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:48,516
No, this doesn't help.
The audit is from'02-'04.

15
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:50,548
These are just receipts from 1995.

16
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:52,764
Look, Gary.
Why don't you just call Taylor?

17
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:55,295
- No. I'm not calling Taylor.
- Who's Taylor?

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,599
He's my little brother.

19
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,997
He's been doing Gary's
taxes for the last 10 years.

20
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:01,621
He's a financial genius.
MBA from harvard,

21
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:05,092
he was vice President of a fortune
500 company at the age of 26.

22
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:07,013
You can also read
about him in the Bible.

23
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:09,270
He did the apostles' taxes,
and he walked on water.

24
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:13,608
And also took the time year after year
to do your company's taxes for free.

25
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,990
Yeah, apparently, Allison,
you get what you pay for,

26
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:17,916
- because I'm being audited!
- Well.

27
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:22,747
Thank god, Dennis, that your cousin's
here. I'll never be able to thank you?

28
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:25,142
- When is your audit again?
- It's monday.

29
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,267
Monday?

30
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:32,590
Where is he going?

31
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:44,855
Gary, are you gonna stop being
so stubborn and just call my brother?

32
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:47,752
I'm not calling your brother, I'll tell
you why, I'm not. Give me the phone!

33
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:51,082
I'm not calling your brother. He always
acts like he's better than me, you know?

34
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,601
- Well, he is.
- He's not! He always talks down to me.

35
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,194
- He should.
- All right.

36
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:58,085
- Always makes me feel like I'm a loser.
- Gary, I mean...

37
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,733
All right! Enough, now.

38
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:02,872
I can't stand the guy. He's always
got some crazy nickname for me,

39
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,514
like boysen-Gary-pie or the Garinator.

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,738
Gary's. Truman.

41
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:11,841
Hey, go for Taylor!

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,618
Hi, Taylor.
It's your ex-brother-in-law Gary.

43
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:16,974
Yo, what's up, G force?

44
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:22,377
- Hey, T-Bone, it's your big sister.
- What's up, Alley Cat?

45
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:26,905
Yeah, look, g force here has
a little bit of a tax audit problem.

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,980
And he was wondering if
you could do him a favor.

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,108
No worries. Been looking for
a reason to get out to Cali, anyways.

48
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,214
No, don't come to Cali.
That's fine. I'll just mail you.

49
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:38,490
- I'll mail you all the receipts.
- It's too late. I'm already on a plane.

50
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,805
T-Bone out!

51
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:46,531
Well, looks like T-Bone is on his
way to see G force and Alley Cat.

52
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,334
That's really great. G force is
gonna go blow out his B-Rains.

Mom, they have a hamburger
that costs $23.

57
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,846

Does it come with a picture
of the chef laughing at you?

58
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:08,958
Bison, monk fish? Is there anything
on this menu I'm not trying to save?

59
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,673
I don't know, sweetheart, but there's
3 things on the menu right there

60
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:15,099
that you're not doing
a very good job of saving.

61
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:19,665
Why do we have to meet
your brother here? This is crazy.

62
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,088
Because this is the only place
he'll go to when he's in town.

63
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:25,687
He's a New Yorker now, Gary. There's
not a lot of things he likes about LA.

64
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:28,702
That's great. Maybe he can share
some of his insight with us.

65
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:32,296
It'd be very refreshing to hear
a New Yorker crap on LA. For a change.

66
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:37,835
Waitress, will you please
introduce me to those two engaging,

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,499
hip, VIP,
trend-setters over there? Wait!

68
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:43,638
That's my niece and my nephew!
I'm with them! Come here!

69
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,297
Come here, you little one.

70
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,435
You! Alley cat, look at you.

71
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:52,956
My goodness gracious.

72
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,181
You look like you've lost 190 pounds.

73
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,487
- What?
- I'm talking about this guy right here!

74
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,737
Yeah. The divorce? Look at you, Taylor.
You look like a million bucks.

75
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,120
That is because i'm sitting
next to Gary.

76
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,990
- May I get you something from the bar?
- Hi, brown eyes.

77
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:15,901
Yeah. I'd like a macallan'25,
3 ice cubes, a drizzle of club soda,

78
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:19,129
and if your phone number is on
the napkin, just know tomorrow

79
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:21,685
you get to choose where
we're going for breakfast.

80
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:32,600
The one year I don't do your taxes,
and you're in trouble with the irs.

81
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,797
Actually, Taylor,
i'm in trouble with the irs from

82
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,817
the years that you did do my taxes.

83
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,611
Look at this guy.
Already with the attitude.

84
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,038
I love it when he plays
so gruff with me.

85
00:04:44,163 --> 00:04:47,221
Don't worry about the irs. I can take
care of that problem in my sleep.

86
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:50,147
The trick is you don't want
to let 'em smell the fear.

87
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:53,038
Speaking of smell, what are you wearing?
It's just fantastic.

88
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:56,123
Thanks. It's Clive Christian no. 1.

89
00:04:56,483 --> 00:05:00,358
Over $2,000 a bottle.
I got it at a boutique in London.

90
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,570
It's amazing. Check this out.
Ivory soap. 49 cents.

91
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,680
- Got it at a big lots in Tarzana.
- Please.

92
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:11,304
Can we not compare smells for once, OK?

93
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,703
Have you met anybody cool lately,
uncle "T"?

94
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:16,931
Well, let's see. Do you consider

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,487
NFL superstar Eli Manning cool?

96
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:24,514
- That's him!
- You know Eli Manning?

97
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,887
I work with him.
I also work with Harrison Ford,

98
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:32,160
Shia Labeouf that is the winner
of the third season of "Survivor."

99
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:35,378
And... rae dawn chong!

100
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,516
Kind of peters out at the end there,
doesn't it?

101
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,194
So, Tom...

102
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,111
When are you gonna fly out to New York
and hang out with your uncle "T"?

103
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,067
- Can i, dad?
- We'll talk about it.

104
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:50,267
You can't expect your dad to
make a snap decision like that.

105
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,786
I told him to buy Google in 1998.

106
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,937
How's that going for you there, Gary?

107
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,917
- We could've been rich.
- It's true. But in Gary's defense...

108
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,128
Who's hungry? Let's order.

109
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:10,019
Hey, Taylor. You hungry?

110
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,611
Yeah. I'm still on New York Time,
so I'm kind of in the mood for sushi.

111
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:16,516
Actually, let's make it toshimi
I'm on a no-carb thing.

112
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,566
- Edame, miso soup, wasabi.
- Okey-dokey!

113
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:26,466
Am I gonna be OK with this
audit on monday, or what?

114
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:29,145
I think we're gonna be all right,
but can I ask you a simple business

115
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,356
philosophy question?
Do you hate making money?

116
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,394
Yes, I hate making money.

117
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,393
Well, then you are
doing everything right.

118
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,949
Why don't you use any of the tricks
or loopholes or mechanisms

119
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:44,394
- that I've set up for you?
- It's the tricks, loopholes,

120
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,687
and mechanisms that got me audited in
the first place. I'm a house painter.

121
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:50,475
You have my corporate headquarters
in the cayman islands.

122
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:52,479
That's completely legal.

123
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:54,781
You don't have to worry about
it till they come knocking.

124
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,136
They're knocking!

125
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,149
There's nothing here
they can ding you for.

126
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,642
Gary, you have to stop
thinking so small.

127
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,661
That is why you are where you are.

128
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,169
Where exactly am i, Taylor?

129
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:12,408
In a Tiny house with a Tiny
business and a Tiny life.

130
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,342
My life maybe Tiny,
Taylor, but I like it.

131
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:21,454
And I'll tell you what I don't like.
You. OK?

132
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,718
For 15 years, I put up with all your
putdowns because you were family,

133
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:28,277
but I don't have to anymore if I don't
want to, because we got divorced.

134
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:32,130
I think you're a Jerk, you're obnoxious,
you're a Jackass, and if I was you,

135
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:33,761
I would take my most expensive car

136
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,297
and I would drive it off
the tallest bridge in Manhattan!

137
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,192
That would be the maserati
and the triborough.

138
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,532
And I almost did that very thing on
the way to the airport.

139
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:49,281
What?

140
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,740
You're right about everything.
I'm a phony.

141
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:53,972
You're Rich.
You're supposed to be a phony.

142
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:58,045
You know, you don't get it.
I lost my job, I lost my accounts,

143
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,339
I lost my savings,
I am living on c credit cards.

144
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,598
Calm down, Taylor.
You're hyperventilating.

145
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,614
I got fi. I got fi. I got fired.

146
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:08,401
- Allison doesn't know.
- What?

147
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,138
Oh, my gosh.
What about all those cool cars?

148
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,420
Lee-leased.

149
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:17,245
What about your apartment,
the penthouse with the elevator?

150
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:19,139
Ee-ee-evicted.

151
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,239
What about that super-gorgeous
girl you were going out with?

152
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:25,350
Trans, trans, trans...

153
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,424
You were going out with a transvestite?

154
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,976
Transferred to London!

155
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:39,388
Oh, my gosh. All right, look. Come on.
Let's blow the dust off. Who cares?

156
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:42,539
Let's get back to the audit, what do
you say? Then we'll take the next step.

157
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:45,317
There's no next step. I neve
want to see another number again.

158
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,445
I'm a failure!

159
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:57,107
My accountant, Ladies and Gentlemen!

160
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,184
Leave me alone, and turn the light off.

161
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:14,260
If your voice was deeper, you'd sound
just like Allison on our wedding night.

162
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,500
Sorry. I was just trying
to lighten the mood.

163
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,105
- With a sex joke about my sister?
- I was wrong.

164
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:24,198
I was wrong. Look, this isn't you.
This isn't you at all.

165
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,843
No way, pal!
The Taylor I know is a winner!

166
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,769
You're a winner!
Now, let's go back downstairs.

167
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:33,567
Let's do those taxes,
attack the audit, let's kick some ass!

168
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,709
Come on, Taylor. Let's go! Let's go!

169
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:43,217
You're Kinda supposed to run after me.
I thought that was clear.

170
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:45,276
I can't. I can't do it anymore, Gary.

171
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:48,362
What do you mean you can't do it?
My audit is monday. You have to do it.

172
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,737
I'm a failure. My whole life is a lie.

173
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:52,995
I am so alone.

174
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,548
You're not alone. You have...

175
00:09:58,384 --> 00:09:59,384
me.

176
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,263
You don't even like me.
Come on. I like you.

177
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:05,559
All right, my children like you.
All right?

178
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,020
I'm here for you, man.
Whatever you need, i'll do it for you.

179
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:11,804
Whatever it is that you need,
I'll help you.

180
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,145
Hold me.

181
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,350
I'll put the Tv on.
I'll make you some soup.

182
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,349
Hold me.

183
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:27,782
Run you a bath.

184
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,759
Get you a magazine.

185
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:34,459
I am a human being crying
out in desperation and need.

186
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:35,967
Just come here and hold me!

187
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,591
All right.

188
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:47,700
There, there.

189
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,798
You don't know what it's like
to be the family superstar.

190
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,000
You did it right, Gary.
You set the bar low for yourself.

191
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:03,345
Nobody ever expected great things out
of you, and you never disappointed them.

192
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,211
That's the toast you gave at my wedding.

193
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,700
Come on, Taylor. So what? You hit
a rough spot. That's not a big deal.

194
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:15,029
The important thing is you got to get
back out there, get back on the...

195
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,530
Is that your pants
and underpants on my dresser?

196
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:22,820
I don't deserve'em. They're the clothes
of success, and I am a failure.

197
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,420
I am a naked failure.

198
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,513
Put these on.
Oh, geez. Put 'em on! Don't!

199
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:32,674
I don't want to see that.

200
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,319
Excuse me.

201
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:36,786
How's the audit going?

202
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,092
Well, congratulations, Gary.

203
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:45,475
It only took you an hour to reduce one
of the most brilliant financial minds

204
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,210
in America to a frightened, insecure
mess, who won't put on his underwear.

205
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:55,036
I'm sorry. I stopped listening after
you said, "congratulations, Gary."

206
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,742
So... thank you.

207
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,358
Is he coming down to do my audit,
or what?

208
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,115
Who cares about your stupid audit.

209
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,314
My little brother is upstairs
in the fetal position.

210
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,668
- You have to do something.
- Why do I have to do anything?

211
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,392
You broke him, Gary, you fix him.

212
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:12,065
That guy got broke all by himself.

213
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,390
He's your brother. You help him.

214
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:17,516
I tried to get him to come home with me,
he doesn't want to leave your bedroom,

215
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:21,161
I don't know what to tell him because,
of course I can't relate to that at all.

216
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:26,007
Look, Gary. I think the best thing for
Taylor right now is just to stay busy.

217
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,754
And that is why I told him you
were gonna put him

218
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,315
- to work on one of your paint crews.
- What?

219
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,121
No. Are you out of your mind?
You think anybody

220
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:36,767
can put a paintbrush
in a paint can and put paint on?

221
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,339
All right, let me start over.

222
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:42,390
I don't want him on one
of my paint crews. I don't like the guy.

223
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:45,351
- Where's your compassion?
- You got it in the divorce!

224
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,682
Hey. Did something
happen to uncle Taylor?

225
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,229
Honey, your uncle Taylor
lost his job and his money.

226
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,647
And his mind.
Well, he did.

227
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,234
So he had a breakdown?

228
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:01,765
Yeah. It's OK, though.
You know, it happens

229
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,480
when people have real high-pressure
jobs and they work with a lot of money.

230
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:08,032
- So it could happen to you?
- Well... What?

231
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:10,987
Your dad is safe, honey.

232
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:16,380
But look, don't worry about uncle
Taylor, OK, because your dad

233
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:20,071
is gonna put him on one of his paint
crews to help him get back on his feet.

234
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,479
Then when he's on his feet,
we'll buy him a pair of shoes

235
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,768
so he can walk back to the airport
and go home.

236
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:29,557
But dad, come on. He's family.
You have to help him.

237
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,091
Is he gonna help me?

238
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,358
Look, be out front tomorrow
morning at 6 am, OK?

239
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,538
6 am? What, are we coal miners?

240
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:51,945
It's pretty simple. You take the brush,
you dip it in the paint, OK,

241
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,033
then you take the paint that's on
the brush and put it on the wall,

242
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:56,250
just like that, OK?

243
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,325
What happens if I get paint on
the clothes that you gave me?

244
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,024
Nobody cares about that. Listen,

245
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:04,907
the roller is when you want
to cover more area faster.

246
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:07,025
You just roll it right up
and down like that.

247
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,704
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

248
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:11,039
What happens if I get paint
on the shoes that you gave me?

249
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:14,931
Nobody cares. Nobody cares if you get
paint look, hey. OK? Look. Great.

250
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:17,116
We're painters. Now, look.

251
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:20,193
Put your hand here. I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna walk you through it. Come on.

252
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:24,236
There you go. Now, when you paint,
you just go up and down.

253
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,531
You can do it all by yourself.

254
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,782
I'm gonna let go on the count of 3, OK?

255
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,769
1, 2... look at that!
You're doing it all by yourself!

256
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:39,028
I don't know, Gary. I don't think your
ex-brother-in-law's cut out for this.

257
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:41,269
Of course he's not cut out for this.
That's the point.

258
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:45,127
He does this, he goes crazy, and then
he begs me to go back to doing my taxes.

259
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,128
Hey, you're really getting
the hang of it now!

260
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,619
What happens when
I finish the entire wall?

261
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:56,227
Don't worry, there's like 3 other rooms
in this house we have to get to, OK?

262
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:59,126
- It's so repetive.
- Yes, it's very,

263
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:02,296
very repetitive. Every minute

264
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,690
is just like the minute before it, every
day is just like he day before that.

265
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,442
It's just all the same,
just day after day.

266
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,221
And there's thousands of walls to paint,

267
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,913
so just turn off your brain and live
your life one boring stroke at a time.

268
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:18,489
I quit.

269
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,728
That speech wasn't for you, dad.
That speech was for Taylor.

270
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:26,844
I'm just trying to freak
him out a little you know?

271
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,257
Right. And I'm proud of you
for helping him out, son.

272
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:31,704
Thanks, dad.

273
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:34,503
You know, you have a great,
big, oversized heart?

274
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,684
That's why i'm helping him, you think?

275
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:39,903
No. It's something I keep
forgetting to tell you. It's hereditary.

276
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,913
I'm gonna go to orange county.
I have a job.

277
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:51,392
If this guy starts crunching numbers,
you call me immediately, OK?

278
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,147
Check. And you should see
a cardiologist twice a year.

279
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,626
- What happened in here?
- We're done.

280
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,103
I mean, you're really done? Like you
covered up all of Taylor's mistakes?

281
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:10,410
We didn't have to. I've never
seen a guy take to a roller like that.

282
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:14,520
Yeah. And he actually painted two coats,
you know and didn't just say he did like

283
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:17,615
I do.

284
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,431
Hey. Beautiful job on
the ceiling in the bedroom.

285
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:26,078
Jack attack, I love the kitchen. Emerald
green was definitely the way to go.

286
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,042
Excuse me. Emerald green?

287
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,859
No, no. The kitchen's supposed
to be butterscotch sunset.

288
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:34,693
It just wasn't in my gut. Sometimes
you got to think outside the box, Gary.

289
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:36,602
No, no, you don't. We're painters.

290
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:40,380
We show up, we see the box, we paint it,
that's it, we're done. The box.

291
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,875
It's the best job I've ever had.

292
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:47,510
Look, Taylor. What the heck happened?
When I left here two hours ago,

293
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:50,351
you were holding the roller
like it was a urine sample.

294
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,223
I don't know. I just...
I fell in love with painting.

295
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:58,091
The silky texture, the smell,
the challenge of an unpainted wall.

296
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:01,040
When I go to bed tonight,
I am going to dream of painting.

297
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:07,203
God, Gary. Was that me?
Was I ever that young?

298
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:12,967
Garinator, you have saved my life. Now
I know why you love this job so much.

299
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,857
It's so... zen, so simple,

300
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:18,796
so primitive. It's like
a Monkey could do it.

301
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,866
Look, Taylor, I told Allison

302
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:26,543
and Tommy that I would
do right by you and I am.

303
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,324
- Great!
- You're fired.

304
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:30,731
- Fired?
- You're fired.

305
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:33,827
I thought the conversation was gonna
go a whole different direction.

306
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:38,130
You don't belong here, man.
You got a brilliant mind for numbers.

307
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:41,600
This job would squash you like a bug.
Come on. It's so repetive.

308
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:45,436
Every day painting and sanding,
painting and sanding,

309
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,896
watching the whole
world just pass you by.

310
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:51,249
I quit.
And this time I really mean it.

311
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:56,316
All right. Come on, Taylor. You got
knocked on your butt, but you gotta

312
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,524
get up and brush yourself off and

313
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,201
use that mind for what
it was made for wall street.

314
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,563
I don't care what you say.
This is my life now.

315
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:06,871
And if you don't want me, I will
find a paint crew out there who does.

316
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:10,340
OK, Taylor, you win.

317
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,332
- You're hired.
- Oh, yeah?

318
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,888
All right. Congratulations,
working man. You get to

319
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:17,019
wash your hands with soap that hurts.

320
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,225
You'll get a check next week,
but in the meantime, here... let me see.

321
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,380
- There's your money.
- What is this?

322
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,774
That's a day's pay.

323
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,889
- A day's pay?
- Yeah. - Hold on a second. Yeah.

324
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,945
I gave you too much. I overpaid you.

325
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,581
- Overpaid?
- I mean, it doesn't seem like much now,

326
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,424
but you have to imagine
it multiplied by 6 more days.

327
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,627
Did the rest of it go to my 401k?

328
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,819
Look at that.
It's Shia Labeouf.

329
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,050
You ready to get back on the horse,
wall street man?

330
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,805
Shia, hold on one second.

331
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,023
I will be ready
for your audit on monday.

332
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,192
They are gonna regret
the day they ever met me.

333
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,616
I know the feeling.

334
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:18,486
Shia-nola,
how'd you know I was on the left coast?

335
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:22,737
My accountant, Ladies and Gentlemen!

336
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,494
Hey, Allison, I just dropped
your brother off at the airport.

337
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,123
He told me to give you a big kiss. We'll
just lie and we'll say we did that.

338
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,054
- How'd the audit go?
- It was amazing.

339
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,699
It was T-Bone at his T-Boniest!

340
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,829
- Wait, did he beat them up?
- Did he beat'em up?

341
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:46,190
They kept leaving the room.
Two guys left,

342
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,698
one guy left
I'm pretty sure just to cry.

343
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,805
All right? I went into that audit
owing thousands of dollars,

344
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,498
I came out of the audit because
of your brother

345
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:57,436
with a check for 83 bucks.

346
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:01,896
That's great, 'cause I just got
a bill for one of Louise's classes.

347
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:03,283
All right. Just take it.

348
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:05,880
