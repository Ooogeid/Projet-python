00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:05,222
Hey guys, I saw your mom pull up.
So, put down your juice boxes,

2
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:07,868
close up your tabs You know,
let's go to your mom's house.

3
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,879
But you got to get the heck out of here.

4
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:13,382
You know, dad, you forgot all
about my cello practice yesterday.

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,181
Or did i?

6
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:19,495
And you forgot to remind
me about my science paper.

7
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:22,762
Sorry, hammer.
I talked to you about it last night.

8
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:26,196
You told me you finished it, so we're
gonna have to tell mom about that one.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,630
Or do we?

10
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:32,235
Hey, guys, would you go wait in the car?
I got to talk to your dad for a second.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,906
If we're gonna talk,
I need one of them as a witness.

12
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:37,685
I just wanted to remind
you that starting tomorrow

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,663
is that thing I told
you about last week.

14
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:41,591
Yeah, the thing.

15
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,585
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,656
The thing. No. I don't know. I told you.

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,916
You want me to really
remember something, you have to

18
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,299
make it rhyme and turn it into
a Catchy tune.

19
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:56,093
I was hired to be a research
assistant on a project that's cool,

20
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:59,109
so I need you to drop off and
pick up the kids at their school

21
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:02,709
- for the next 6 weeks yeah.
- I can't do it.

22
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:03,834
What?

23
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,845
I'm renovating the mckenzie house,
big job.

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,317
That's a historic Landmark.

25
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,871
I got to be on site the whole time
and keep an eye on the workers.

26
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:14,240
This could really lead to
a lot more work, so, sorry,

27
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,059
you're gonna have to find somebody else.

28
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:20,257
That's too bad. Maybe you know
someone who could help me with these.

29
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:22,199
Yeah. I won them in a raffle.

30
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,485
- Laker tickets.
- They are. Yeah.

31
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:27,601
Of course, I don't think
they're very good seats because

32
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:29,763
they're behind a bench of some kind.

33
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:33,179
You win, you win, you win.
Lakers-cavaliers. You totally win.

34
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:36,635
Look. I'll drive the kids around
whenever you need me to,

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,379
I'll keep my ears open and my eyes open
for anybody that can help you part-time?

36
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:44,242
There are your tickets. It's never
a pleasure doing business with you.

37
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:48,124
I got to bring my air horn to the game.

38
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:50,738
Not you. I mean the actual one
that used to come in a can.

39
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:55,499
Well, have fun
with Dennis at the lakers.

40
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,656
All my orgasms were fakers

41
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,540

00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,923
Look at these seats. These are way
better than the last time we went.

46
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:15,805
I know. Remember?
Our seats were terrible.

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,125
You put your binoculars
in front of my binoculars,

48
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,430
and we still couldn't
tell which dot was kobe.

49
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:22,270
We're gonna sit behind the bench.

50
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,164
Good morning, mr. Brooks.

51
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:28,631
Hi, Miss Peters.
I like to make all my workers feel good.

52
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:31,226
I give them a motivational
hug every morning.

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,088
That...

54
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:38,134
I'm not gonna let you down,
Miss peters. I appreciate the work,

55
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,910
and you're gonna find that my crew
is top-notch and professional.

56
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:43,784
Deja vu.

57
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,976
No. It's not deja vu, dad.
It's your fifth trip into the room.

58
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:52,932
That's not it. It's something else.
What is this place?

59
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:55,531
It's the Mckenzie house.
It's an historic Landmark.

60
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,628
This was owned by Hamish Mckenzie.

61
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:03,246
He was a shipping magnate
in the late 19th century.

62
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,968
The house was restored in 1975,
and before that,

63
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:10,913
it was a flophouse
for indigents and hippies.

64
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,184
That's it.

65
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,999
I lived here in'71.

66
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:20,396
You still got that big orgy room out
in the back yard with the giant doors?

67
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,325
You mean, the carriage house?

68
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:24,888
No. I'm pretty sure it was an orgy room.

69
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,259
I get a tax break by hiring him.

70
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,685
Pardon me. I'm looking for my...

71
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:39,989
- Gary, this is amazing.
- Yeah. I can't disagree.

72
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:45,070
- How long has it been?
- I don't know.

73
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:47,678
Probably since like, the last time
we saw each other which was when?

74
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,444
You don't recognize me, do you?

75
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,060
Throw a drink in my face.
See if it jogs my memory.

76
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:55,897
Anna! You're an...
Oh, my god, Anna!

77
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:58,177
You're Dennis' little sister Anna.

78
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:00,717
- It's good to see you again.
- You, too.

79
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,256
Anna, you were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

80
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:04,973
When you're late, you got to call me.

81
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,083
I'm sorry, Dennis, OK?
I was out looking for a job.

82
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,956
You want me off your couch, don't you?

83
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,293
On your couch? What's the matter?
You're not still living in Chicago?

84
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:16,183
No. I moved back after my
Jerk boyfriend dumped me.

85
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:17,839
Come on.
Who would dump you?

86
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,762
- Lots of guys.
- Really?

87
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,902
No. She's serious. Lots of guys...

88
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,861
lots.
Now, how'd the job search go today?

89
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,938
Well, I got one offer, but I don't want

90
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:33,227
to dress up like a cell phone
and hand out coupons at the racetrack.

91
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,788
Hey, hey, I might have a job for you.

92
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,540
Allison is looking for someone to
help out around the house

93
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:42,697
- part-time and with the kids.
- Really? That would be great.

94
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,596
How are Louise and Tom?

95
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:47,191
Fantastic and easily distracted,
in that order.

96
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,829
Allison, it's Gary,
the answer to all your problems,

97
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,964
except for you stretch marks
and your screechy voice.

98
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,255
We must've gotten
disconnected or something.

99
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:02,555
Here. You talk to her, OK?

100
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:07,677
Allison, hi. It's Anna Lopez.
I hear you're looking for somebody.

101
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:11,559
- What's wrong, Dennis?
- What's wrong?

102
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,464
Anna iback in town. You see,

103
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,596
I'm the oldest brother, and it's
my responsibility to look after her.

104
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:19,352
My dad said he'll murder me if
anything ever happens to her.

105
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,126
Your dad is not gonna murder you.

106
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,030
Latinos are very protective and literal.

107
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:27,017
I wasn't always
the oldest brother, Gary.

108
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,528
I'm starting later this afternoon.
Can you believe it?

109
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,806
- Hey, that's great.
- Thank you, Gary.

110
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:37,121
That's great. Save some
of that hug for Allison, OK?

111
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,652
Well, bye, Gary. See you, stupid.

112
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,985
Sorry to bother you, Gary. Louise
wanted me to come by and feed her fish.

113
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,665
She said you would forget.

114
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,699
Louise has fish?

115
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,482
- Come on in.
- Where's her room?

116
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:02,247
Right down the hall on the right.
It's the girly one.

117
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,153
How's it going over there?

118
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,256
Fantastic. Thank you so much
for getting me the job.

119
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,594
Of course. Come on. You're Dennis'
sister. I got to look out for you right?

120
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:13,029
Remember when you and
Dennis drove me to college

121
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,199
and you took me to the wrong Carolina?

122
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:22,732
Yeah. I still think you would've
done great at Clemson, though.

123
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,189
Yeah, but I didn't apply there,
and I didn't have anyplace to live,

124
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:30,131
so it would've made for
a rough freshman year.

125
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,354
But the job is great.

126
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,352
Allison is awesome,
and I guess I'll be over here a lot,

127
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,338
assuming the goldfish stay alive.

128
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:41,082
I don't know. We're having a bad
run in the fish world.

129
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,592
My toilet is known as
death's water slide.

130
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,445
So, this is your new house?

131
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,695
Yeah. It's kind of like my old house
took a dump and this one came out,

132
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,772
but it looks a little better with
a buzz. Can I get you a beer?

133
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:59,750
Well, I'm off the clock, and in a way,
you're my boss, so I guess I have to.

134
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,423
Well, congratulations.
Your first day with Allison.

135
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,837
You know, she's no picnic to work for,

136
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:08,615
and she's no picnic to be married to,
and she's certainly

137
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,642
not easy to go on a picnic
with when you're married to...

138
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:15,634
My gosh, am I speaking way too loudly?
I thought you were still the other room.

139
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,552
I thought I was supposed
to follow you in here.

140
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,975
Well, I'm glad you did
because I'm lazy. Here.

141
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,277
- Here's to getting to know each other.
- Here you go.

142
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:31,029
You know, I had a huge crush
on you when I was younger.

143
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,758
Really? I didn't know that.

144
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,409
I used to kiss my pillow
and pretend it was you.

145
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:42,396
What a coincidence. I used to kiss
Allison and pretend it was anyone else.

146
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,300
Are you nervous?

147
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:55,140
- You're trembling.
- I'm standing in the refrigerator.

148
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,386
Let me warm you up.

149
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:06,559
Wait. Come on, Anna. This is wrong.
You're Dennis' little sister. Come on.

150
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,374
Well, technically,
I'm not his little sister anymore.

151
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,634
I'm a grown woman,
or haven't you noticed?

152
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,734
Yeah. Boy, I noticed, OK?
I noticed. I noticed, I noticed.

153
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:18,477
Look. If we did go through
with this and this did happen.

154
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,646
Which I'm sure would be
one of the greatest things

155
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:23,024
to ever happen to me in my life,
and I am including

156
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,677
the time I rode behind Chuck Norris
on an escalator.

157
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,758
What if we broke up? Then Dennis,
his heart would be broken.

158
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:33,736
He's my best friend. I can't
let that happen to him. I'm sorry.

159
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,688
OK. You're right. You're a good friend.

160
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:40,314
I just wanted to fulfill an
innocent little fantasy where

161
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:44,056
I turned Gary Brooks
inside out with wild sex.

162
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,096
Well, that's not gonna happen.

163
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:58,215
Is there any way you can
pretend for one little minute

164
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,789
that you're not my
brother's best friend?

165
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,053
Just one minute,

166
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:05,497
and I'll never bother you again.

167
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,215
Anna, you have to realize something. OK.

168
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,212
We should probably stop now.

169
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:18,890
No way. I got 48 seconds left.
I'm counting in my head.

170
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:21,077
45... 4 Hey!

171
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:27,534
I don't know how that snake
bit you on your tongue,

172
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:29,820
but I think I sucked out all the poison.

173
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:36,224
Whew! I better go find
that little bugger.

174
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:40,176
Dennis, I can explain.

175
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,193
You don't have to explain. I have eyes.

176
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:43,805
- Gary and I were just.
- Just

177
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,953
making me the happiest
older brother in the world.

178
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:51,925
Oh, my god...

179
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:54,829
I'm not following you. This is great.

180
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:58,388
Everyone in my family has been praying
that Anna would find a decent guy,

181
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,843
- and she finally did.
- Really? Who?

182
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:06,029
You, you knucklehead. Come on.
I'm gonna get out of here,

183
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,227
and you guys go back to doing
whatever it is you were doing.

184
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:23,883
That was weird, and you know what?
Now that the sense of danger

185
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:27,000
is out of it, it's really not even
that interesting anymore.

186
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,856
Oh, my gosh, Anna, last night
was amazing. I can't even believe it.

187
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,385
Morning, hon. I let you sleep in,
but you better get moving.

188
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:48,830
I did the laundry. Little thing, honey.
Would you mind emptying your pockets

189
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:51,333
before you throw stuff in the hamper?
I've been fishing change

190
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,427
- out of the dryer all morning.
- You did the laundry?

191
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:57,116
And the doctor called confirming
your appointment on friday.

192
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,614
Sweetie, could you let me know
when you make appointments

193
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:03,167
so I don't schedule stuff for the same
time? We're a team, right?

194
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:07,272
How long was I asleep?

195
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:15,256
This parlor room is
currently under renovation,

196
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,366
but this is where Mr. Mckenzie
took his breakfast,

197
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:21,355
drew up contracts,
and met with local merchants.

198
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,670
Yeah, and Dennis Hopper played
backgammon with frank zappa right there.

199
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:30,048
Pay him no mind.
That rumor is unsubstantiated.

200
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:32,736
Now, if everyone could just
head into the kitchen there...

201
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:33,635
Where.

202
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,141
Where tommy smothers
never made hash browns!

203
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:38,827
Hash brownies...

204
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,821
And yes, he did.

205
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,235
I think she's starting to dig me.

206
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,577
What's wrong?

207
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:55,183
Dad, it's Dennis' sister.
She's kind of making me a little crazy.

208
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:58,701
We hooked up like, 3 days ago, and she's
acting like we're a married couple.

209
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,427
That's the second
weddingi missed of yours.

210
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,088
No. We're not married, dad.

211
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:08,445
And that's the second divorce I missed.
Excuse me.

212
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,863
Hey, Gary, look who I found.

213
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,122
Sweetie, you forgot your lunch.

214
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:16,603
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't screwed on.

215
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:20,373
You know what? Thank you, but I'm gonna
go out to eat with the guys today, OK?

216
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:23,341
Restaurant food is full of salt,

217
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,547
and I like my Gary not puffy.

218
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,403
And I bought you some new underwear.
I thought you might like to try

219
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,450
a pair where the elastic band
is attached to the fabric.

220
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:37,691
How adorable are you guys?
I just want to eat you up.

221
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:43,009
I talked to mom and dad. They want all
to get together at grandma's for easter.

222
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:45,178
I can't wait for you to
meet our grandma, man. Me?

223
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:47,069
She's just gonna eat you with a spoon.

224
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:50,377
All right. What's with you people? Can't
you like somebody without eating them?

225
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,524
Stop it. I'll see you at dinner, OK,
and don't be late.

226
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,559
I'm making something special.
Bye, honey.

227
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:57,408
See you, stupid.

228
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,102
I've never seen Anna this happy before.

229
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:02,872
It's so great that she's with somebody
that's gonna treat her right,

230
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:05,418
- not like all the other guys.
- Yeah. You know what? To be fair,

231
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:07,761
we never heard all those
other guys' stories.

232
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,871
What are you doing here?
You don't have the kids today.

233
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,607
What, I have to have the
kids to walk into your house?

234
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:19,373
According to the court, yeah.

235
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:23,854
Look. I know you're working super
hard with school and everything, and

236
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:27,603
I really forced Dennis' sister down your
throat, so if it's a big inconvenience

237
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:29,835
it's not working for you,
i'm really sorry about that.

238
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,792
No. Anna is amazing.
I couldn't get along without her.

239
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,925
So, if she was to get angry and suddenly
leave town, that wouldn't be cool?

240
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,774
No. That wouldn't be cool. I mean,

241
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,613
I love her, and the kids love her.
The only thing that isn't cool is,

242
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:48,284
she started dating some crepy older guy.
You might know him. He's you!

243
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:53,191
Are you insane?
I finally find a perfect nanny.

244
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:56,597
Mary poppins comes floating down from
the sky. You're looking up her skirt.

245
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,767
She's smothering me, Allison.

246
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:01,598
She leaves "i love you, Gary"
post-its all over the house, right?

247
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:04,502
She draws hearts
on my mirrors with lipstick,

248
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,251
and she runs baths for me.
She rubs my feet.

249
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:08,546
What a bitch.

250
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,306
Look, Gary.
You cannot break up with her, OK?

251
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:14,803
If you dump her, she will dump me, and I
need her whole lot more than I need you.

252
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:17,309
- Well, find someone else.
- You are stuck, Gary, OK?

253
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:20,278
The only thing you could hope for is for
Anna to break up with you. That way,

254
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:23,374
Dennis won't be pissed at you,
and she won't leave me.

255
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:27,000
She's not gonna break up with me.
Who would leave this?

256
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:33,575
Me and any other woman with legs.

257
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,582
Why did you leave me?
Why did we get a divorce?

258
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:40,055
OK. There are boxes of transcripts,
Gary. You can read them?

259
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,548
Look.

260
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:45,800
If you want her to break up with you,
just stop being

261
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:49,318
first-date Gary, you know?
Be 10-years-Down-the-road Gary

262
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,176
with the open boxers at breakfast
and the peeing in the shower...

263
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,062
I get it.

264
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:56,893
And the gassy, scratchy, burpy, slurpy,

265
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:58,994
cutting-your-toenails-on-the-sofa Gary.

266
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,469
I get it! I'm a disgusting man!

267
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:11,994
How you doing?

268
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,164
Hey, sweetie, where you been?

269
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,246
At a bar. I know you probably
made dinner and everything,

270
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:23,560
but I already filled up on wings and
beer, and if you're mad, I don't care.

271
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,293
I'm not mad. I'll just put it in
the fridge, and you can have it later.

272
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:30,857
Don't feed it to me as left over
because I don't eat leftovers,

273
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:33,317
all right, and if you're mad about that,
I don't care.

274
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:37,074
I'm not mad.
You should eat whatever you want.

275
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,764
You know what? Maybe I don't
want to eat whatever I want.

276
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:44,775
What's with you? It seems like a totally
different guy just walked in the door.

277
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,712
Yeah. He did, OK, baby doll?

278
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:49,010
The real Gary Brooks just
walked in that door, all right?

279
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,469
Get used to it,
and if you're mad, I don't care.

280
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,700
Are you kidding?
I love it.

281
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:01,474
This means
that you are comfortable enough

282
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:04,540
in our relationship to be yourself.

283
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:06,884
We just took a huge leap forward today.

284
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:11,623
OK. All right. OK. I give.

285
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,997
- Timeout.
- Great.

286
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,903
I don't want to take a leap forward.
I just got out of a marriage,

287
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:19,210
and with you, it's like
I got back into another marriage.

288
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:20,992
It's like you're acting like my wife.

289
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,573
You mean, because I cook your
favorite food and take care

290
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:25,566
of you and make love to
you whenever you want?

291
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:27,442
Yeah. You're nothing like my wife.

292
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,692
It's been 3 days. Don't you think
this is a little intense?

293
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,613
Wait, wait. What are you saying?
Are you breaking up with me?

294
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,496
No. I'm not.
I would like you to break up with me.

295
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,122
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- OK. Then, I'm breaking up with you.

296
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:42,250
Why?

297
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:45,443
Don't take this the wrong way.
You're beautiful, and I really like you,

298
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:48,462
but you're a teeny bit banas.

299
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:53,785
Here we go.
I'm getting the bana talk again.

300
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:56,191
Again? You've had the bana talk before?

301
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,453
Lots of times, and the bana talk

302
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:01,182
is the very first warning sign
there's something wrong.

303
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:05,731
- Anna, I didn't mean any...
- No. You blew it.

304
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,396
There's no coming back from banas.

305
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:14,379
- Hey, there he is.
- Talk to your sister?

306
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:19,067
Guess you didn't hear the big news.

307
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:22,600
I knew this was gonna happen, but I just
didn't think was gonna happen so soon.

308
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,625
- Dennis, Dennis...
- Wait, wait.

309
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,983
I'm gonna remember this moment forever,
and I want to make it perfect.

310
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:29,556
Wait.

311
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:37,304
Say the words I've been dying to hear.

312
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,634
- I dumped your sister.
- Those weren't them. Try again.

313
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,532
It didn't work out. I broke up with her.

314
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:46,494
That's all there is to it.
It's no big deal?

315
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,053
But you know what? You can't just treat
her like some toy and toss her aside.

316
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:52,746
You know, a real friend wouldn't
do that. You suck, and I quit.

317
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,453
We go somewhere and talk about this?

318
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:57,192
Anything you have to say to me
you can say in front of my friends,

319
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,063
- Your real friends?
- my real friends.

320
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:01,191
We picked 3 of these
guys up this morning.

321
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:04,431
Well, you know what? I trust them
a lot more than I trust you, Gary.

322
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,122
Dennis, look. It didn't work
out with me and your sister.

323
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,526
I tried to tell her that,
but she wouldn't listen, all right?

324
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:13,102
So it's her fault. Can you believe this,
guys? He's blaming my sister.

325
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:17,147
El Gary la hecha la culpa
a Anna porque se dejaron.

326
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,825
I knew that if we broke up,
it would break your heart,

327
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,588
and I don't want to do that to you, OK?

328
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:25,777
So it's my fault.
Can you believe this guy?

329
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:29,661
Creen este guey?
Ahora, Gary le hecha la culpa a Dennis.

330
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,571
To be fair,
there's two side to every story,

331
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,223
and I'm not sure my side
is being represented here.

332
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:39,711
Scusi, amigos.

333
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:44,035
Hermana de Dennis muy bonita pero

334
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,665
always aqui, aqui, aqui.

335
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,239
"Aqui, aqui, aqui."

336
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:55,768
I'm out of here.

337
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:58,160
Dennis, wait a second.
You said your sister was a handful,

338
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:00,247
- didn't you?
- Know what you're talking about.

339
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,940
You told me she got dumped by
"lots of guys, lots," your words.

340
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,371
We're a passionate culture.
That's all I know.

341
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,554
Didn't a part you want me
and your sister to work

342
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,876
out so you wouldn't have
to worry about her anymore?

343
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:14,617
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

344
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:15,966
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

345
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:20,435
I got carried away. I got excited about
you being a part of our family.

346
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:23,570
Dennis, you're my best friend.
We already are family, OK?

347
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,061
Can't we just go back
to being you and me?

348
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,756
I don't know. What do you guys think?

349
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,005
4 of us think you should stay together,
3 are against,

350
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,029
and one of us thinks the
whole thing is kind of gay.

351
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:46,938
What do you think? That's 4 for staying
together 3 against, and one kind of gay.

352
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:53,766
I still got the laker tickets. We got
purple and gold paint here. We could

353
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:57,910
paint a big "l" on my chest.
Will you paint a big "a" on your chest?

354
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:05,357
Now it's unanimous.
We all think it's kind of gay.

355
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:22,581
- Oh, my gosh, dad!
- Hey, Gary.

356
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,338
You know Miss Peters.

357
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,793
- Yeah. Hi, Miss Peters.
- Mr. Brooks.

358
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,394
Yeah. Is my dad bothering you?

359
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:34,003
But you are kind of harshing my mellow.

360
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:36,459
Yeah. I'm gonna take a sick day.

361
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,832
