4
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:09,099
Gary, last night was wonderful for me.

5
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:12,013
- It was wonderful for me, too.
- You probably never thought

6
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,947
you could just spend the night
with a woman and not have sex.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,887
After 15 years of marriage,

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,017
it's amazing what you can
accomplish when it's not your choice.

9
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,388
Well, I appreciate you understanding.

10
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:26,535
It's important that we don't rush this,

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,520
but your patience will be rewarded.

12
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:32,307
- Really?
- Yeah. Just not right now.

13
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,265
OK. See you later, Gary, and again,

14
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:42,331
thank you for last night.

15
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,528
Yeah.
Thank you.

16
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:49,571
Well, Mitch, there goes
another satisfied customer

17
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,631
from Gary's house of love.

18
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,325
Over 5 serves.

19
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:59,180
- You got nothing.
- I got nothing.

20
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,724
- How did you know?
- I'm a marine.

21
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:06,047
I can hear an enemy scout sneaking
into a foxhole from 200 yards away.

22
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,086
Last night,
I didn't hear that.

23
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:13,010
Look, Joan's a great woman, Mitch,
you know?

24
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:15,052
It's just we had
a few missteps on our way

25
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,938
and she doesn't want to seal
the deal until we've really

26
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,037
made sure we're right
for each other. It's torture.

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,188
- So why are you hanging in there, man?
- Cause she's fantastic! She's beautiful

28
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:26,116
she's a schoolteacher, she's willing
to put up with a guy who's divorced

29
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:27,961
with an annoying ex-wife, two kids,

30
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,121
and a deadbeat brother
who's sleeping on his couch.

31
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:34,203
Another Veteran comes home
and gets treated like crap.

32
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:37,146
Well, you are welcome for the freedom.

33
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:41,586
I'm just kidding? You're my brother.
I love having you around.

34
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,131
- It's been great.
- Look, you're right. I've been kind

35
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:47,681
getting your way around here. So I think
it's time I pack my stuff and moved on.

36
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,826
No, no. Mitch, where are you gonna go?

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,571
Tommy's room.

38
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,155
That's your big plan?
You're gonna move on 20 feet?

39
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:57,414
Yeah, yeah.
And if you're available later,

40
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,584
I sure could use help
moving some of this stuff.

41
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,642
I'd love to, but I have to get to work.

42
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:04,399
And thanks to Joan,
I have to go take a cold shower.

43
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,287
Allison called. Something about
replacing her garbage disposal.

44
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,765
Oh, my gosh! I totally forgot!
I told her I would do that for her.

45
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,432
Now I got to go to Allison's house,
but now I don't need that cold shower.

46
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:19,808
Deeper.

47
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,265
Hold on to it.

48
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,949
Now...

49
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:27,466
Let it all out.

50
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:29,908
Oh, my god!

51
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:33,581
Slower.

52
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:37,256
Oh... my... god.

53
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:43,708
Namaste.

54
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:48,336
Thank you for letting
my energy be one with yours.

55
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,519
Seven, I'm sorry.
I was still feeling your energy...

56
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:07,073
but we were somewhere else
and they weren't here. Bye.

57
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,462
- Bye, Seven. Thank you.
- Pleasure.

58
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:14,836
Your home is an oasis
of calm and beauty.

59
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,612
- It's much like your soul.
- Thank you.

60
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,870
- That'll be $200.
- Oh, god.

61
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:23,168
I, I got that right over here.

62
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:26,549
You know, Allison, I would love
to give you a private session.

63
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:29,013
- I think you're ready.
- I'm ready. I'm eager.

64
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,297
I am an eager bea...
I am eager.

65
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,342
That's wonderful.

66
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:36,334
And then maybe after the session,
I can take you out for an...

67
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:37,948
An herbal tea.

68
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:39,443
That is so weird.

69
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:43,059
You love herbal tea, and I am having a
birthday party for myself this saturday.

70
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,425
Why don't you come?

71
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,390
All right.
It would be my...

72
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,065
It would be my honor to be here to
help you celebrate turning, what, 24?

73
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:54,761
Seven, you are so...

74
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:56,666
In the ball park.

75
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:58,862
Until then,

76
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,382
this Jasmine oil is for your...

77
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,346
Heart chakra.

78
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,238
Thank you.

79
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,711
I am so tired of oiling my own chakra.

80
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,353
What's the matter?
Aren't your girls cold enough?

81
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,285
For crying out loud,
my tongue used to get stuck on that.

82
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:36,459
I am overheated.
I just finished a workout, all right?

83
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,625
- What do you want?
- I'll tell you what I don't want.

84
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,815
I don't want to be here
fixing your garbage disposal.

85
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,089
You know what? Just

86
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:45,293
get it over with and get out, OK? And
don't make mess and don't eat anything.

87
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,137
After I saw where you store your food,
that's not a problem.

88
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:51,989
Let's go ahead and add "no talking"
to the list, OK?

89
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,577
Why are you so cranky? I thought
yoga was supposed to mellow you out.

90
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,559
I am very mellow, Gary.
Bite me.

91
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,059
I saw your yoga instructor
walking down the driveway.

92
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,682
- What's his name? Nine?
- Seven, Gary.

93
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,648
Well, I saw those pants he was wearing.

94
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:09,156
I think calling him "four"
would have been generous.

95
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:15,122
You're just jealous because
he's in shape and you're "a shape."

96
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,334
Well, Joan doesn't have any complaints.

97
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,992
Then she probably
hasn't had sex with you yet.

98
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,026
What do I do about this?

99
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:27,411
Wait a minute.
You guys haven't done anything?

100
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,457
I thought we added
"no talking" to the list.

101
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,312
That was before I found out
Joan and you hadn't closed the deal.

102
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:34,216
How do you know that?
You don't get anything.

103
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:36,755
The last time you had action,
you sat on your keys.

104
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,639
Gary, just shut up
and fix the garbage disposal!

105
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,866
- Fine. Stay out of my way.
- Fine! Stay out of my way!

106
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,412
- No, stay out of my way.
- Fine. I will.

107
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,600
Look out.
Watch it. Watch...

108
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,548
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

109
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,190
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

110
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:14,392
Oh, my gosh.

111
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:17,524
What do we do now?
What do you think we should do?

112
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:19,888
- What do you think we should?
- I think I should leave.

113
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,657
- Do you think i should leave?
- Want to leave? Then you should leave.

114
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,988
OK, I'm gonna leave.

115
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:26,739
- Oh, my god! You're just gonna leave?
- No, I'm not gonna leave.

116
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,615
- I think we should talk about this.
- I'm gonna leave.

117
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,204
Gary, I can't believe we did this.
I mean, what were you thinking?

118
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,383
Me? Why are you blaming it on me?
Why is it my fault?

119
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:38,682
- Hello! You're the man.
- Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,804
You had ice cream bars on your boobs.

121
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:44,002
OK, I'm sorry.
In what world is that me setting you up?

122
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:47,045
Because you know I love ice
cream and you know I love boobs.

123
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:49,415
You totally set me up.

124
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,222
Look, we cannot tell anybody
that we did this, OK? No one.

125
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:56,735
Right. I'm gonna run out and tell
my friends about having sex with you.

126
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:57,963
Hey! Then I know!

127
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:01,603
I'll brag about the time I sneezed
and peed a little in line at the bank!

128
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,242
I'm gonna go.

129
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,014
- What are you doing? I don't have any beer.
- Getting a beer.

130
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:17,976
Yeah, I always kept one taped up behind
the light in case of emergencies.

131
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,529
But if I knew this was
gonna be the emergency,

132
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:23,195
I would have taped up
a wobbly chair and a noose.

133
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,293
Gary, what is your brother doing here?

134
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:31,298
I forgot. I told mitch to come
by and bring me my pipe wrench.

135
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:33,434
Just act natural like nothing happened.

136
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:34,774
Come in.

137
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,942
Hey, here he is.

138
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,999
- You just did it.
- What?

139
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,016
That's crazy, Mitch.
Tell him he's crazy.

140
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,527
I hate myself!

141
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:56,388
- Way to play along, Allison.
- I'm sorry, Gary, but I really do!

142
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:58,199
What are you crying for?
I wasn't bad.

143
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:01,502
Yes, Gary, it was! You have
never been a good judge of that.

144
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,791
So does this mean you guys
are getting back together?

145
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:08,933
Oh, my god! No!
What a horrible, horrible thing to say!

146
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:11,736
What's wrong with you? Don't even
joke like that, Mitch. Watch it.

147
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,474
I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's a legitimate question.

148
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,482
I mean, Allison just...

149
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:18,819
Gave you her most precious gift.

150
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:24,253
Her gift was a lot more
precious two kids ago.

151
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,167
Yeah? You still unwrapped it
like a drunk monkey.

152
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:36,718
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i'm going to schedule myself a flea dip.

153
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:43,177
Stop looking at me like that, Mitch!
Nothing happened!

154
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,832
I had meaningless sex with my ex-wife.
The end.

155
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:49,284
Great. I just spent 5 years in
afghanistan trying to convince

156
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,583
them that Americans aren't
a bunch of decadent freaks.

157
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:54,331
And here you are, jumping bed to bed,

158
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:56,521
listening to your Rock'n'roll music,

159
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,264
wearing your blue jeans!

160
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,502
You just made America
less safe today, Gary.

161
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:03,004
Nice job!

162
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:24,611
I didn't hear you come in.

163
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,783
If you were an enemy combatant,
you wouldn't be able to say that,

164
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,688
'cause your throat would
already be slashed!

165
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,089
Hey, is that a real gumball machine?

166
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,540
Yeah.
Have all you want.

167
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:50,462
- Here are your bags, uncle Mitch.
- Thanks, Louise.

168
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:51,732
Hey, hold on a second.

169
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:53,950
Let me give you a little
something for the effort. Here.

170
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,013
- Here you go.
- What?

171
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:57,959
You said I could have all I wanted.

172
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:01,642
- Thanks, uncle Mitch.
- You bet.

173
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:03,947
So, roomie...

174
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,353
Flip you for top bunk.

175
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,738
All right.
Here we go.

176
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:10,827
- Call it.
- Heads.

177
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,922
Sorry. All right.
You got bottom.

178
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:16,074
- But I didn't even see if it was...
- Trust me.

179
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,825
- You got bottom.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:20,178
All right.
Hop on those bags.

181
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:39,877
I just fixing the garbage disposal
'cause I knew you wouldn't be home.

182
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:42,064
- I can leave.
- No. It's good. You know what?

183
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,842
The party's tomorrow night.
It'll be nice to have it fixed, so...

184
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:45,951
So...

185
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,441
- Yeah.
- So...

186
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:54,248
Look, Gary, I've been thinking
a lot about what happened.

187
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,769
- Shouldn't we talk about this?
- I don't need to talk about it.

188
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:59,069
But shouldn't we just
talk about it and try...

189
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:02,146
We don't need to talk about it,
we don't need to read articles about it,

190
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,059
we don't need to take an intimacy quiz,

191
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,205
we're not gonna
act out our feelings with little puppets

192
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:10,062
or hit each other with anger sticks,
unless the padding's taken off

193
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:11,612
and I get to go first.

194
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:15,528
Just let it go. We had sex.
It was a mistake. We're done.

195
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,438
- OK, forgotten.
- Thank you.

196
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:25,438
So I'm thinking about having
mini quiches at my party.

197
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,020
What do you think?

198
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:33,839
How did we get here from "mini quiches"?

199
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,036
I don't know, Gary.
We need help.

200
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,263
Yes, we do.

201
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,680
Thank you for coming, Walter.

202
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,478
I'm happy you called me.
You said there was a problem.

203
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,398
I'm not sure what it is.

204
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:50,606
I'm glad we could put our complicated
past aside and discuss it.

205
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,367
What's complicated about our past?

206
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,443
Allison and I separated, you guys
started dating, we got divorced,

207
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:59,137
you guys got engaged,
and then she dumped you.

208
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:04,267
Thank you for the "Tv guide" recap
of the most painful year of my life.

209
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,239
You really need this guy?
We have to see Dr. Krandall about this?

210
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,760
Yes, Gary, unless you want to start
all over with a new therapist.

211
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,493
No, I don't want a new therapist, but do

212
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:13,548
we have to use the one
that did grief counseling

213
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,658
for the survivors of the "Titanic"?

214
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,887
I'm not gonna let your insults
dissuade me from my mission, Gary.

215
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,180
Whatever it is you want to discuss,
I will advise you

216
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:24,113
in a purely professional manner.

217
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:25,714
Gary and I slept together.

218
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,243
Animals! Filthy, disgusting animals!

219
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:30,744
The two of you should be fixed!
Fixed!

220
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,351
Excuse me.

221
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,275
Please continue.

222
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,275
OK, Walter, I know this is
difficult for you,

223
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:45,769
but, please, you have to help us
understand what's going on here.

224
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,675
Fine. It's not uncommon
for a divorced couple

225
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:51,240
to relapse into a physical relationship.

226
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:54,704
It's comfortable, it's familiar,
and there's no strings attached.

227
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:58,566
But why us? I mean, the sex wasn't even
good when we were married, you know?

228
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:03,109
It took me a CPR mummy to realize
how magical a kiss could really be.

229
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:05,480
Really?

230
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:09,558
Because you doing foreplay is like a
seal learning a new song on bike horns.

231
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:13,313
Look, don't beat
yourselves up over this.

232
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,668
You're intelligent, thoughtful
people who caught a mistake early on.

233
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:19,326
Just be grateful you
only slept together once.

234
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:27,218
- Actually, it was twice.
- Skank!

235
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,813
Miscreants!
Insatiable, lust-filled heathens!

236
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,470
You should be locked up!
Locked up!

237
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:42,990
- Good to see Krandall again.
- He looks good, doesn't he?

238
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:00,310
Dude, not cool!

239
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:02,418
Heat rises.

240
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,458
Sorry.

241
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,234
Look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, OK?

242
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:11,796
I'm just gonna go get a can of beer
and a half-dozen hard-boiled eggs.

243
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:14,872
You're gonna wish you
never started this war.

244
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,147
Get ready for some shock and awe!

245
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,368
Wait, wait.

246
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:25,672
This is my room, OK?
And these are my rules.

247
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:27,736
You're here to sleep where I tell you,

248
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:31,112
You're gonna move your bags, and you're
gonna replace every single gumball.

249
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,168
Anything coming out
of me is due un the fact


250
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,585
you took us for burgers
and you ordered onions rings.


251
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:39,396
All right? Not me, you!
So just get in the bottom bunk!

252
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:47,225
I'm proud of you, standing up
to me like that. That had to feel good.

253
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,571
Thanks.

254
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:52,115
- Still want the top bunk, though.
- Yeah, I'm good with that. Go ahead.

255
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:58,071
Hey, how'd you get
tricked into bartending?

256
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:00,278
I volunteered.
When I was in the military,

257
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:03,028
I didn't see a whole lot
of women in short dresses,

258
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:05,864
so I thought it'd be best
if I stood behind something.

259
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,435
Well, the lady would like a margarita.

260
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,975
OK. And, Joan, what would you like?

261
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:16,306
That's a little leatherneck
humor for you right there.

262
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,928
I'll have the same.
I'm gonna check out the food, OK?

263
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,829
This must be a little weird for you,
having Joan & Allison in the same room.

264
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:25,328
No, it's not weird at all.
Tonight is all about Joan.

265
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:28,411
I mean, look at her. She's smokin'.
Allison's my ex-wife.

266
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,040
We're divorced, and we're just gonna
ACT like a normal divorced couple, OK?

267
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:34,349
Just mind your own business.
Here comes Allison.

268
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,073
- What? Nothing.
- You look great, in a

269
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,794
"desperately clinging
to your youth" kind of way.

270
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,546
Gee, thanks, Gary.
You look nice, in a...

271
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:47,179
"peaked in high school" kind of way.

272
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:50,324
If I didn't know you, I'd say there's
something still going on between you two

273
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,586
in a really kind of messed up way.

274
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,098
There's nothing going
on between us, Mitch.

275
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:57,545
No, no.
Whatever it was before, it is over.

276
00:15:57,628 --> 00:16:00,873
We did it. It was great.
It's done, OK? OK?

277
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:02,338
All right.

278
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:07,937
Hey, Gary, you want to try
one of these mini quiches?

279
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,734
I, think I might be allergic to those.

280
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:16,042
Happy birthday. And I...
brought you a little something.

281
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:20,563
It's a pebble I found while walking
the beaches of the black sea.

282
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:24,781
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Well, actually, it found me.

283
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:27,067
It was late july.
I was walking along...

284
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,864
Hey, just could you just excuse me for,
like, one second?

285
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:31,782
But, seriously, I love the rock. I do.

286
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:35,519
Hi, Joan. Boy, you look pretty.
Gary, I need to talk to you.

287
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:40,473
- What did you mean, "it was great"?
- What?

288
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:42,053
You said the sex was great.

289
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:44,040
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did, Gary.

290
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:46,671
You told Mitch, "we did it,
it was great,

291
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:49,428
and it's done." I want to know what
the hell you meant by "it was great."

292
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,543
I probably meant it was great, OK?

293
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,779
I mean, you, you moved around.

294
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,083
You made noise, you had your legs
wrapped around me like a cage fighter.

295
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:02,680
Crap, Gary. It was great.

296
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:05,279
- It was great for you, too?
- Yeah, It was amazing, all right?

297
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,722
Don't raise your voice.
I didn't do it on purpose or anything.

298
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:10,596
Why couldn't it have been awful,
like when we were married? You know,

299
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:13,976
it was the very first time
I imagined your head on your body.

300
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:18,174
Why didn't you picture
seven's head on my body?

301
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:19,632
Next time I will.

302
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:25,959
Hi, Seven.
I am ready for those private lessons.

303
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:28,039
Great. I'll check my calendar.

304
00:17:28,126 --> 00:17:30,113
I'm free anytime...
You know, morning, afternoon.

305
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,448
I can have all these
people gone in 15 minutes.

306
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:35,601
- Hey, I need to talk to you, Allison.
- No, no.

307
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:36,779
Yeah, I do.

308
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:38,805
Hey, come here.

309
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:42,105
- What, Gary?
- What do you mean, "next time"?

310
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:45,426
I didn't mean to say that, all right?
Believe me, I don't want to do it again.

311
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:48,647
Then why are you wearing
your "i want to do it again" dress?

312
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,831
I'm not. I'm wearing my "i want
to do it again but not with you" dress.

313
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,571
And what about you, with the nice jacket

314
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,733
that shows off your shoulders and gives
you the illusion of a waist?

315
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:02,139
Thank you. I'm not wearing it for you.
I'm wearing it for Joan.

316
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,433
I am not wearing this for you, OK?
So leave me alone.

317
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,443
You leave me alone, all right?

318
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,829
I got it. I got it.

319
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:26,719
- I got it.
- I thought you fixed it!

320
00:18:26,802 --> 00:18:30,271
I couldn't fix it! You kept dragging me
up to your bedroom to have sex with me!

321
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:32,091
I dragged you?

322
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,121
You were chasing me around like
I was made out of biscuits.

323
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:39,402
You jumped on me like a mountain lion
jumps on a hiker with a broken leg.

324
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:43,614
God, Gary, look at this mess. You know
what? This is just like our marriage.

325
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:47,070
I'd ask you to do one little thing, but
course, you can't be bothered to do it.

326
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:50,024
This can't be anything like
our marriage because we keep having sex.

327
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:54,007
I cannot believe I am in here making out
with you while there is a gorgeous man

328
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,504
waiting in there for me.
Now, if you don't mind, Gary,

329
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:59,087
i'm going to see how many
times seven goes into 39.

330
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:11,601
Happy birthday to you

331
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,709
am I the only one who knows this?

332
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,320
You know, all in all,
it was one of my better parties.

333
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,594
It was rockin', right up to the point
where everybody found out we had sex

334
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,480
and Joan threw a drink in my face.

335
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,961
Do your eyes still
sting from the tequila?

336
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:36,003
Well, the left one is
completely clouded over, so no.

337
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:38,620
But the right one,
I'm starting to see shapes out of that.

338
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:41,576
I think that's you over there, right?

339
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,813
So you think you still
got a shot with Seven?

340
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,338
Who cares?
I mean, he wears a toe ring.

341
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,020
And his real name is Larry, you know?
What was I...

342
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:54,219
- What was I thinking?
- You'll find a guy, Allison.

343
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:55,579
I'm 39.

344
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,037
Yeah, but you're also
divorced with two kids.

345
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:04,893
Why do you think we ended
up back in bed together?

346
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:05,990
I don't know.

347
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:09,103
I think it's like Krandall said,
you know? It's just easy and familiar.

348
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,710
New relationships are hard.

349
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,789
Yeah, but, why, Gary?
Why was it so good?

350
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,271
It didn't have the weight of the whole
marriage on it: the mortgage,

351
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:20,740
the bills, the kids.
It was just crazy and wild

352
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:23,448
and fun, like when we first
started dating, that's all.

353
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,369
That's exactly what it was.

354
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:30,504
So if we knew divorce
was gonna be this hard,

355
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,784
do you still think
we would have done it?

356
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:37,464
I would marry and divorce
you all over again.

357
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:41,715
- That is so sweet.
- I'm a charmer.

358
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:48,089
But if we have a chance of
making this divorce work,

359
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:51,608
- we can't end up in bed together.
- Never again. Ever.

360
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,223
Are you ever gonna fix
the garbage disposal?

361
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,146
You should probably just hire a guy.

362
