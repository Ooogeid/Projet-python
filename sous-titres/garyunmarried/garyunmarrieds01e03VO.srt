1
00:00:02,597 --> 00:00:04,295
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:07,420
Breakfast!
What did I do to deserve this?

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,810
You know what you did.

4
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:12,828
Well, I would have done it a lot faster
if I knew there was gonna be bacon.

5
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:16,084
Seriously, there's
a faster version of that?

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,636
Get out of here.

7
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,664
All right. I'm gonna need a frying pan.

8
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:20,826
All right.

9
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:28,821
- And a frying pan handle.
- Right.

10
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:33,410
Seriously, don't lose these, OK?
It's also how we start the car.

11
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,380
I know I'm going out on a limb here,
but do you have a bowl?

12
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:42,121
But I have a colander.
How fast can you work?

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,575
Honey, you have nothing to cook
with or eat off of

14
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:48,743
in this house.
What do you do when the kids are here?

15
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:51,824
We put paper plates in frisbees,
like the rest of America.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,630
You can buy stuff, you know.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,224
I know, but after the split,
this was the first place I found,

18
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,709
and I didn't want to spend a
lot of money and buy great stuff

19
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,341
to replace all the great
stuff that I used to have.

20
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:06,136
So you went out and got everything
you needed at what?A hardware store?

21
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:08,772
A 99 cents store actually.

22
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:13,289
You know you laugh but I tricked out
the whole house for 36 bucks.

23
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,724
So that explains
the plastic shower curtain

24
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,970
that hugs my body like a horny ghost.

25
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,738
Actually, no.
That came with the house.

26
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,312
The guy that moved out
forgot to take it with him.

27
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:26,466
Sucker.

28
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:30,773
Look, it's no big deal.
I'll get some new stuff eventually.

29
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:35,340
OK, you don't have any plates in your
house, but you have a $300 cake mixer.

30
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:36,923
Is that what that is?

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,024
I had no idea. I just know Allison
really wanted it in the divorce,

32
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,543
so I fought for it.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,338
There's your mom, guys.
Come on. Throw out your paper plates

37
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,746
and rinse off your frisbees
this time, OK?

38
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:02,541
- Is that a new purse, mom?
- Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:04,127
- Is that leather?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:05,761
Is that necessary?

41
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:09,855
Louise, honey, honey,
the cow was already going to be food.

42
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:12,686
You know, to not use its
skin would just be wasteful.

43
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,124
Does it have a special pocket
for your rationalization?

44
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:21,310
What do you do with her when she's
here, give her sarcasm lessons?

45
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,931
Yeah, like, 40 times a day.

46
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,591
Look, Gary, I hate to bring this up, but

47
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,679
it's the beginning of the month,
and my spousal support is late again.

48
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:33,585
Has it been a month already?
You know, that's amazing

49
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:37,555
'cause when we were married,
the months went by so slowly.

50
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:43,536
And, Gary, I have to deposit these.

51
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:46,736
Could you please stop writing
"this is a hold-up" on the memo line?

52
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,404
- Come on. It got you on the news.
- Look...

53
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,031
Why do you do this to me, Gary?

54
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,541
Really. My spousal support is a
hard-earned salary

55
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:01,047
for 15 years of raising your children
and being your wife.

56
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,330
- What did I get for being your husband?
- 15 years

57
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,853
of never having to flush a toilet.
Come on, kids!

58
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:10,338
Besides, walter and I get married, you
won't have to pay me any more support.

59
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,639
But if I don't pay spousal support,
what will I have to talk about

60
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,914
with all the hobos
down at the blood bank?

61
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:20,480
When are you two crazy
kids gonna set a date, anyway?

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,628
I don't know.

63
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,176
Walter doesn't seem to be in a hurry
to set a date. I'm OK with that.

64
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,214
He has been in a little funk lately.
I'm just not used

65
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:31,603
to dealing with someone whose problems
can't be solved with french fries.

66
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,444
I understand. You know,
walter probably hates french things.

67
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,738
All those painful memories
from world war i.

68
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:42,516
So walk me through this again.

69
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:45,340
Once Allison is married,
you don't have to pay any money at all?

70
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,353
I still have to pay child support,
but that's cool. That's for the kids,

71
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:50,556
but spousal support, my god.
That's

72
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,954
like paying workman's comp
to a guy that cut off your fingers.

73
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:56,979
So all you really need to do is
go light a fire under Krandall.

74
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,714
Yeah, that'll work. He's my
ex-therapist. I'm an ex-patient.

75
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,210
I'm gonna convince him
to marry my ex-wife?

76
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:05,218
You know, you're great at
convincing people to do stuff.

77
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:07,583
- You think so?
- Yeah. Remember the time

78
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:10,985
you got me to agree to a pay cut
in exchange for stock options?

79
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,019
I was an idiot.

80
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,349
You're just a guy with a van.

81
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:22,630
There was no stock.
All right, that was genius, all right?

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,152
You do the same thing to Krandall.
You get him to set a date.

83
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,420
- All right.
- Then,

84
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,914
you'll have enough money to give me
the pay raise you've been talking about.

85
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,533
I'll tell you what,
instead of a Raise,

86
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,696
how about I make you vice president?

87
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:42,624
Nice try, Gary, all right?
It's president or nothing.

88
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,070
You got yourself a deal.

89
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,442
Why don't you sit down
and tell me what's on your mind?

90
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,794
Where to begin, you know, Dr. Krandall?
I guess,

91
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,091
I've been feeling pretty adrift lately,

92
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:00,405
- You know, since I'm single.
- But you have a girlfriend, right?

93
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:03,693
Sure. I have a girlfriend, but that's
not the same as being married.

94
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,399
A real, live wife like Allison.

95
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:09,886
- I hope you know how lucky you are.
- Yes, allison is a wonderful woman.

96
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:14,159
I mean, Allison's amazing, dr. Krandall.
Come on. She's beautiful, she's...

97
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:22,109
She's punctual, right?
She's on time. She, she's smart.

98
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,982
She's very smart, and that's
something she always lets you know.

99
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:27,946
You always know she's smart,
'cause she always corrects you

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,467
if you use words wrong

101
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,711
or if you don't know how many justices
are on the supreme court.

102
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:33,973
- 9.
- 9.

103
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:36,238
See? You know that, too.
What are the odds two people

104
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,698
in the same town know that?
That's crazy!

105
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:41,259
You guys are soul mates,
for crying out loud!

106
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,270
I'm a little surprised, gary.

107
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,629
This isn't exactly how you referred
to Allison during your counseling.

108
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:50,308
I believe you once referred to her as
"Satan's life coach"?

109
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,351
Well, sure. All the pet names.

110
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:57,328
They sound a little corny when
they're taken out of context.

111
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,510
In hindsight, Allison has
a lot of amazing qualities,

112
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,507
Dr. Krandall, that I you know,
I took them for granted.

113
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:05,368
You actually did care
for her, didn't you?

114
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,817
Of course I did. We were
together for 15 years.

115
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:09,834
We made a home together.

116
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,124
She's the mother
to my children, you know?

117
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:15,084
I blew it with Allison, and
you can't make that mistake.

118
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:18,131
I got news for you, Krandall. There's
a lot of interest for allison out there,

119
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:22,080
all right? And if you're not careful,
I might take another run at her myself.

120
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:24,804
You're very convincing,
Gary, and you're right.

121
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:27,154
I need to make my move. Attaboy!

122
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,828
That's great. That's a
good decision, Krandall.

123
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:33,059
Enough of this. Let's get back to you
and your feelings of being adrift.

124
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,017
No, I feel great now.
I feel very connected.

125
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:36,955
You're good. You're
very good. Listen,

126
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,043
you got calls to make,
a wedding to plan.

127
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:41,923
I have to throw you a bachelor party.
You're gonna love it this time,

128
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:45,604
'cause these days, the ladies don't hold
feathers in front of their bodies.

129
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,032
Can't believe we're watching c-span.

130
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,430
It's my tv day, and this is
our government in action.

131
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,582
Yeah, I'm on the edge of my seat.

132
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:01,251
This would be a lot more interesting
if you could vote someone off.

133
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,954
You can, idiot, every two years.

134
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:11,381
Hey, kids, daddy made a big sale today,

135
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,955
so guess what!
Donuts before dinner!

136
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:19,461
- What's, what's going on here?
- Well, let me bring you up to speed.

137
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,267
Some old guy in a suit walked across
the room with a piece of paper.

138
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:29,185
No, not c-span. What's going on,
what's this? What is this?

139
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,210
They're plates dad. Vanessa bought them,
and she got bowls and dishtowels.

140
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,356
She's got all sorts of stuff in there.

141
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,475
Look at that. The esteemed gentleman
from wisconsin has his barn door open.

142
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:44,828
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

143
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:47,823
- Where'd you get all this stuff?
- From the store.

144
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:50,065
I keep forgetting
how long you were frozen.

145
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:53,245
Look, I got some kitchen
essentials for you.

146
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:56,560
I wanted to try them out, so I made
you and the kids some grilled cheese.

147
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,134
- Hope I didn't ruin your dinner plans.
- No, I'll turn off the porch light.

148
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:02,566
The delivery guy will
never find the house.

149
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:07,424
You are now the proud owner
of place settings for 8,

150
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,135
matching silverware,
water and wine glasses.

151
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,797
Hey, this pan looks the
same way as your old one,

152
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,729
except it has a handle that's
attached to it at all times.

153
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:18,181
Isn't that a little showy?

154
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,765
Well, what's wrong? Don't you like it?

155
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:25,085
Yeah. I like it.
It's just there's so much of it.

156
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,826
Look, I think I know
what's going on here.

157
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,448
Look, I went through the same
thing when I got divorced.

158
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,988
I didn't unpack any of my boxes for
3 months because I didn't want to admit

159
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:39,290
that I was a 26-year-old single mom
living in a guest house.

160
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,577
Well, that's not what's going on here
at all because I'm not a single mom.

161
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:47,349
I mean, you know,
not that I know of.

162
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,816
Gary, sooner or later, you're gonna
want to feel at home in your own house.

163
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,849
I got to go pick up parker.

164
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:57,664
Look, now I just want you to enjoy it.
You know, try it. You might like it.

165
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,149
What's wrong with you?

166
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,769
Well, I hope you weren't rooting
for the highway appropriations Bill

167
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,654
getting out of committee, 'cause
it's not gonna happen this year.

168
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:24,152
Go away, allison. I
don't have any more money.

169
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:29,474
Wake up.

170
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,466
OK, but Vanessa can
never know about this.

171
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,497
Shut up. This is serious.
It's about Walter.

172
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,817
What happened?
Did he have a fall?

173
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,339
He broke off the engagement!

174
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,312
- What? Why?
- Because of you!

175
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:51,468
Jeez, Louise!
Look, stop it! What did he say?

176
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:53,751
You were the one in his
office today. You tell me.

177
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:55,971
That's between me and my therapist.
Come on.

178
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:57,928
He thinks you're still
in love with me. What?

179
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:00,288
I didn't say anything that
would give him that impression.

180
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:03,612
- Then what exactly did you say?
- I don't know. I,

181
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,975
I told him you were beautiful.
I told him you were smart.

182
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,916
I told him it was great
being married to you.

183
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:10,403
Gary, what were you thinking?

184
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,406
It was either that
or tell him the truth.

185
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,832
I mean, look, you said he was
shuffling his feet about

186
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:18,906
setting a wedding date.
I had to go in there and make a sell.

187
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,557
Excuse me. I do not need to be sold, OK?

188
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:25,018
OK. Look, the merchandise
isn't exactly flying off the shelf, OK?

189
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:27,797
I can't believe you did this, Gary!

190
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,768
I mean, my god!
Don't you want me to be happy?

191
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:32,172
I want you to be married. I
don't think you can be both.

192
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,332
Well, thanks to you,
i'm gonna be neither.

193
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:39,380
That was the worst booty call ever.

194
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:50,022
"Om," my ass.
Get up, Krandall.

195
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,614
How dare you! I was
just about to transcend.

196
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,944
That's disgusting. If you want
to do that, lock your door, all right?

197
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:59,056
Why did you tell Allison that
i'm still in love with her?

198
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,992
- Because you are, Gary.
- No, I'm not. That's crazy.

199
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:05,288
Even if there was some bizarro, wacky
universe where I was in love with her.

200
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:07,358
- Which you are.
- I'm not in love with her!

201
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:09,907
Why'd you call off the engagement?
That doesn't make sense.

202
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:13,101
'cause recently I've been wrestling with
the idea that because of my immediate

203
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:15,683
attraction to Allison, I didn't do
enough to save your marriage.

204
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:18,479
Yes, and I thank god
every day that you did it!

205
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,788
So when you came in here yesterday,

206
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:23,091
saying all those
wonderful things about her,

207
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,425
I came to the painful realization

208
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,874
that I crossed an ethical boundary
by sleeping with your ex-wife.

209
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:32,289
Hey, I stole magazines from
your lobby. We're square.

210
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,815
Look, you've got to get this through
your head. The only reason I wanted you

211
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:40,172
to set a date with Allison is so I
wouldn't have to pay alimony. That's it!

212
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,490
Sure, that's what you thought
in your conscious mind,

213
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,969
but in the part of your Brain
you can never access,

214
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:47,937
or even pronounce,
you meant every word!

215
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:50,539
I think I know what's going
on in my own Brain, Krandall.

216
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,625
Sure. You know the simple
things like "i'm hungry,"

217
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,297
"i'm thirsty,"
"i need to make water."

218
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,011
But you never would have said those
things if you didn't mean them.

219
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:03,131
Krandall, you know me pretty well.

220
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,287
I don't have a lot of levels.

221
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:09,675
Gary, please, it's quite normal.
You're at a point in your divorce where.

222
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,650
You're at the point where lots of men
realize they were happier being married

223
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,870
Yeah, well, I'm not one of those guys.

224
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:26,808
Look for the signs in your own life.
Are you resisting change?

225
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:28,547
Longing for what you used to have?

226
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,101
Preoccupied with your
ex-wife's romantic attachments?

227
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:33,162
Does any of that sound familiar, Gary?

228
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,488
You're wrong about this Krandall. You're
wrong, and you're making a big mistake

229
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,481
if you don't marry my wife.

230
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,240
- Your wife, Gary?
- My ex-wife!

231
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,060
You knew I meant to say my ex-wife!
I said wife by accident!

232
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:48,591
By accident, Gary?

233
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,940
There are no accidents. The very
idea of accidents is a fallacy.

234
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,849
A fallacy? Is everything
about a penis with you people?

235
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,481
Ex-wife. Ex-wife.
It's my ex-wife. Ex-wife.

236
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:05,909
Ex-wife. Ex. Ex-wife. Ex-wife.

237
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:08,081
- Hey, handsome.
- Hi.

238
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:10,430
I wasn't ex-pecting you. Ex-pecting.

239
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,594
Ex-pecting you.

240
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:15,567
I went to the drugstore and I
picked up a couple things for you.

241
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,510
I got you some soap, some shampoo,

242
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,095
and a shower curtain that understands
the meaning of the word "no."

243
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:24,705
Nice.

244
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:32,192
Why aren't you using
one of the plates I got you?

245
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,092
If I use one of the plates,
it'll get dirty

246
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,234
and then it won't match
all the other plates.

247
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,106
Yeah, well, it's supposed to get dirty

248
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:42,479
and then clean and then dirty again.
It's kind of how plates work.

249
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:45,200
Yeah, I understand the theory
of plates, sweetheart.

250
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,868
It's just, I don't know.
For me, this is more fun.

251
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:54,391
What? When I'm done, I throw it on
the lawn and the sprinkler cleans it.

252
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,021
- What are you doing?
- Taking back the stuff I got you.

253
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:01,704
- You didn't buy me the mixer.
- Yeah, well that I just want.

254
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:02,922
All right.

255
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:05,598
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this?

256
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:06,620
You know what?

257
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,474
This is really my fault. I should known
you're weren't ready for any of this.

258
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,386
You don't have to
take all the plates back.

259
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:15,137
Are you sure you want to put the glasses
underneath. You probably have a plan.

260
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,486
This really isn't about the stuff.
You're not ready

261
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:20,068
to accept that this is your home.

262
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:22,509
I mean, you're a painter and
there's no paint on the walls.

263
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,255
If I ever paint this place, i'm gonna
use a company way better than mine.

264
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,106
You've been here for 3 months.
Why are you so afraid to live here?

265
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:35,236
Because this isn't my home.
My home is where Allison is.

266
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:39,803
That didn't come out right. That's.
This place is just temporary, OK?

267
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:43,072
"Temporary" means that you're going
somewhere, Gary. Where are you going?

268
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,725
Oh, my gosh.
I have one quesadilla off of a frisbee,

269
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,427
now I have to answer all
of life's tough questions.

270
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:57,105
If you ever decide that you're
ready to leave your old life

271
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:59,648
and move into your new one, let me know.

272
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:13,456
- Gary! What are you doing?
- I need to talk to you. Let me in.

273
00:15:13,618 --> 00:15:16,555
No, it's after midnight.
I'm not letting you in.

274
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:19,928
What.

275
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:26,701
- I didn't know that was up there.
- That's 'cause I never locked you out.

276
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,911
- What do you want?
- Listen for 15 years,

277
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,272
you knew what was going on
inside my head.

278
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,067
Right now, I need you to tell me
what's going on inside my head.

279
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,102
Based on my experience,
nothing. Good night.

280
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:37,957
Come on, Allison.
Please help me, please.

281
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:41,163
Why should I help you, gary? You screwed
up my entire life. I got to tell you,

282
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,789
- i'm still a little pissed.
- Just have a seat. It'll be OK.

283
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,002
Look, Vanessa's mad at me
'cause I wouldn't use some plates,

284
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:49,987
and she said that I want to
get back to my old life. What?

285
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,019
Well, according to walter, my ex

286
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,496
fiance, he thinks you
still have feelings for me.

287
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:55,759
What? That's insane.

288
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,646
Then why did you sabotage
my relationship?

289
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,877
It was for the money, OK?

290
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,807
So you're not jealous of Walter?
You're not in love with me?

291
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,564
No, no.
I'm not in love with you.

292
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:08,650
I'm not in love with you at all.
I mean, I care about you a little bit.

293
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,554
I mean, if you were attacked
and mauled by a grizzly bear,

294
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:14,017
I would call for help on
my way out of the woods.

295
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:17,982
If I have any love for you whatsoever,

296
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,083
I promise you, it's
buried under thousands

297
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,385
and thousands of layers of resentment

298
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:25,404
and anger and bitterness

299
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:29,179
and that week we had to spend in Branson
in the same hotel room with your parents

300
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,568
and when your curling
iron burnt down my office

301
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,194
and you made me get a vasectomy
and then you made me unget it

302
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,126
and then you made me get it again!

303
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,184
- You rember all that stuff.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,491
- You're, like, so in love with me.
- What?

305
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,481
- Yes, you are.
- No, that's the opposite.

306
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:47,702
- I'm not. It's so obvious.
- Look at you.

307
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:50,466
No, that's not you know what?
Stand up, Allison.

308
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,307
- OK, kiss me.
- What?

309
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:53,568
Let's kiss.

310
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,973
Kiss, because the second
my lips touch yours,

311
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:59,653
i know if I'm in love with you or not.
And if I am, I'm gonna go downtown,

312
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:02,477
buy a pistol, and I'm
gonna blow my Brains out.

313
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:06,273
- But either way, I have to know.
- Gary, I already know, all right?

314
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,465
Come on. Kiss me.

315
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,251
Come on. It'll be all right.
Kiss me.

316
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:11,521
OK, fine, you know what?
Fine. Just make it quick.

317
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:12,538
All right.

318
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:16,825
Kissing Allison.
Kissing Allison.

319
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,166
Kissing Allison.
All right. Here we go.

320
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:22,718
Can you put your hair up,
do something with your face?

321
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,858
- No, I'm going to bed!
- No, no, it's OK.

322
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,177
You're not making this
easy on me, Allison.

323
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,011
OK, on the count of 3.

324
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,060
Could you please not act
like we're lifting a couch?

325
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,333
All right.

326
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,245
You're right. I'm sorry.

327
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:39,214
- Hang on.
- Why'd you stop me?

328
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:43,383
Now I got to go through
everything again! Kissing Allison.

329
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:45,066
- Kissing Allison
- Gary? Gary?

330
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,609
- What?
- What if you like it?

331
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,811
- What?
- I mean, like, you know, what if it's,

332
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:50,999
you know, really, really good?
Then what?

333
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,802
That was awful!

334
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,148
High-five!

335
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,266
Yeah.

336
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:20,367
- Yeah, you're, you're welcome.
- This is great.

337
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:23,326
There's nothing for me here.
I can move on. I'll see ya.

338
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:26,106
Good for you, Gary.
Good stuff.

339
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,591
What? What, what?

340
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:34,506
I'm sorry I messed things up between
you and Krandall. I really am.

341
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:38,808
And I was serious when I said
he'd really be lucky to have you.

342
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:41,148
Thanks.

343
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:42,720
Too bad he broke up with me.

344
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,584
- He'll be back.
- How can you know that?

345
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:46,513
I saw him pedaling his
bike up the driveway.

346
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,543
What?

347
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,445
- Hi, Walter.
- I couldn't stay away.

348
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:57,797
Allison, I know the ethics of
our situation are questionable.

349
00:18:58,064 --> 00:19:01,446
But it occurred to me when Gary came
to my office for the second time...

350
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:03,478
How little I like Gary.

351
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,593
- What?
- I'm not gonna torture myself anymore.

352
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,774
- I love you, mango.
- "Mango"?

353
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,594
I love you, too, cranberry.

354
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,799
My god. What are you guys, a smoothie?

355
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,409
Allison, will you marry me
at a nonspecific date in the future?

356
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,453
Of course, Walter.

357
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:21,781
Honey.

358
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,087
That's so nice!
You two, this is great.

359
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:29,514
When you say "nonspecific date," you
mean you are getting married, you just.

360
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:32,926
You don't hear me at all, do ya?
All right. Well, i,

361
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,755
I guess I'll just leave
you two alone, then,

362
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:40,492
and, I'll just be headed out
and you two enjoy yourselves.

363
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:47,283
- I'm blindfolded.
- Right. Sorry. OK, here we go.

364
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,567
Come in.
Come on. It's OK.

365
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,035
There you go. Steady.

366
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,577
All right.

367
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,679
What do you think?

368
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,773
- I'm blindfolded.
- Right. Sorry. - Sorry. Here.

369
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:03,996
Welcome to my new life, OK?

370
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:10,499
- You look good in it.
- So do you.

371
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,222
Thank you. It's beautiful.

372
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,688
But the paint fumes,.
Can you open up the window, maybe?

373
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,294
Oh, my gosh. We could die in here.

374
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,195
Oh, my gosh!
Dennis painted 'em shut!

375
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:30,304
I'd fire him, but I just made him
president of the company.

376
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,560
