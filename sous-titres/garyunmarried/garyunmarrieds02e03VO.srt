1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:03,867
The play of the year has to be

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,787
Eric Bruntlett's unassisted
triple play to beat the mets.

3
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:11,819
I don't know how many times that's
happened, but I bet it's rare.

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,514
Yeah. Why would you know how
many times that happened?

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,173
It's not like you have your own
sports talk radio show or anything.

6
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,676
This guy's terrible.

7
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,229
I know. That's why we're firing him.

8
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,100
You the best, baby.

9
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:28,172
Wait. Curtis, if you're firing him, are
you gonna be looking for someone else?

10
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,236
That's the plan.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,530
Is there any way I could
be considered for that job?

12
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:33,901
Sure.
How you set for magic beans?

13
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,357
What do I have to do to get this job?
Do I have to interview?

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,298
Do I have to fill out an application?

15
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:42,128
Would it help if I told
people I was 1/16 apache?

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,938
You know, it's such a long shot.

17
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:47,441
They got a lot of professional
guys comin' in here for this job.

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,608
It was also a long shot when I jumped
from the second-story balcony

19
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,731
into the motel pool,
and if you rember, I almost made it.

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,596
Let's wrap this up.

21
00:00:57,318 --> 00:01:01,007
OK, look. You have to cut a demo,
submit it to the station manager.

22
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:03,809
Then you'd have to hope that anyone
with more experience doesn't apply.

23
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:06,395
What if I happen to know
a great sound engineer

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,234
who's been my best friend since high
school? Could he help me cut a demo?

25
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:13,531
Gary, I can't do it, OK? I mean, you're
supposed to be paintin' this place.

26
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:17,744
What if I had photographs
of this best friend sound engineer

27
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:20,682
wearing nothing but a pointy Madonna Bra
and making out with a chick

28
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:24,141
with an Adam's Apple who's holding
his magic beans and stalk?

29
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,026
Gary Brooks demo, take one.

30
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:34,367
I'm ¨Gary Brooks, and this isthe score.

31
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,668
-= 203 =-
" Gary's Demo"

32
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:40,142
VO By :  ¤Aka¤

33
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:42,673
Team Subs-Addicts"

34
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:46,434
OK, Tim from Oxnard,
the longest field-goal record

35
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:49,258
is shared between
Jason Elam and Tom Dempsey,

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,428
but we got to agree the record really
belongs to Tom Dempsey. Am I right?

37
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,316
No. Dempsey deserves an asterisk,

38
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,684
because the half shoe gave
him an unfair advantage.

39
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:58,111
Tim, follow me on this.

40
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:01,605
He was wearing half a shoe
because he only had half a foot, OK.

41
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:05,366
And not the good half with the toes,
you Dummy. Listen,

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,805
Listen, Tim from Oxnard,
why don't you

43
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:12,366
and the people of your fine city
get together and do something important,

44
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,139
like get a better name
for your town than Oxnard.

45
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:19,419
I'm Gary Brooks,
and that'sthe score.

46
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,676
All right.
That's a wrap.

47
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,309
What's your beef with Oxnard, man?

48
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,417
Nothing.
Just a stupid name.

49
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,667
We judging things by their names now...

50
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:32,627
Gary Merril Brooks?

51
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,901
It's a family name,
and aunt merril is a wonderful woman.

52
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:42,929
I'd say you cut yourself a pretty good
little demo here, man. I'm impressed.

53
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,164
Just do me a favor. Don't get your
hopes up. Sasha's a tough customer.

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,056
Hey, all I ask is
that she puts me in the mix,

55
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:51,641
and that is why I am sweetening the pot

56
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,805
with a coupon
for the number 2 meal at burgeroos.

57
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:59,474
Wait a minute.
Sasha is a woman who drives a BMW

58
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,991
and gets a radio station
for a birthday present.

59
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:05,428
She's not gonna listen to your demo
cause you gave her a coupn for a burger.

60
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,795
- I got one for you, too.
- Snap. Let's go right now.

61
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,066
Other interesting facts about Oxnard...

62
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:21,167
It's the largest producer
of Strawberries in California,

63
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,937
it's the only deep-water
port north of long beach,

64
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:28,261
and it's the only city on the west
coast that contains the word "nard."

65
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:34,947
We got a problem.
Tom was threatened by a boy at school.

66
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,873
Oh, my gosh.
Tommy, what happened?

67
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:38,976
I was at my slocker,
and this guy came up to me,

68
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,378
and he told me he was gonna kick
my butt tomorrow after lunch.

69
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,598
- Who is this little punk?
- Dylan Mccormick, and he not so little.

70
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,587
I heard he got in
a fight with seventh grade.

71
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:50,059
- In seventh grade.
- No, withseventh grade.

72
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:55,183
OK, Tom, it's clear you're gonna
have to send this kid a message.

73
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,433
You're gonna need,
about 4 feet of P.V.C. Pipe,

74
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,825
a can of hair spray,
a cigarette lighter, and a potato.

75
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:07,860
And a ticket stub to a movie you
were at when all this went down.

76
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:13,634
Mitch, could you and louise excuse
us for a second so we can talk to Tom?

77
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:16,468
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Louise, you like Strawberries?

78
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,490
How'bout deep-water ports?

79
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,508
I'm not going to oxnard with you,
uncle Mitch.

80
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,304
OK. Tommy, you think you
can take this guy or what?.

81
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,154
I'm sorry.
Tom is not fighting anyone.

82
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:30,189
This school has a zero tolerance
policy when it comes to bullying.

83
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:33,935
We'll bring it to the principal's. We'll
arrange a conference with Dylan parents.

84
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:37,041
I told Tommy he could stay home till we
got this whole thing straightened out.

85
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:40,616
Sure. He'll just stay home from school,
and then when he goes back to school,

86
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,646
you can meet him for lunch
and breast-feed him in the cafeteria.

87
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,721
Look, I'm not proud of this, but I beat
up my fair share of kids in school.

88
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,953
A lot of those kids were just like Tom,
kids that,

89
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:57,185
just by lookin' at 'em, you knew they
weren't gonna give you any trouble.

90
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,435
Here's the bottom line.
By not goin' to school,

91
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:02,881
you send the bully a message
he can just keep pickin'on Tom.

92
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:04,613
Tom, you gotta go back to school.

93
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:07,548
All right, but when he needs braces,
you're paying for them.

94
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:10,253
- Nothing's gonna happen to his teeth.
- I was talking about his legs.

95
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:16,773
God, I Miss the days when you'd spell
things out so I wouldn't understand.

96
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:21,672
Honey, it was just that your father
couldn't understand them either.

97
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,616
Tom, let's go out in the yard.
I'm gonna show you some moves.

98
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:28,533
You mean like, like, like how to punch?

99
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:32,231
No, like how to curl up in the fetal
position and protect your Oxnards.

100
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,783
So I know I'm new here,
but my goal

101
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:43,617
is to make KPPQ
a really great place to come to work.

102
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:46,344
We're really just gonna
be one big happy family.

103
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,080
Does that sound good, Henry?

104
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,542
I'm Chris.

105
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,726
Really?
'cause you look just like Henry.

106
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,008
I'm Henry.

107
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,423
OK. Good meeting.

108
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,406
You know what?
I have to give her my demo.

109
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,074
I'll, just hand it to her.
Hey, you know what?

110
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,587
I should mail it to her.
That's easier.

111
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:09,314
- You're gonna mail it to right here?
- Right.

112
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,915
How are you gonna address it?

113
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,372
"This station, exactly
where we are, California"?

114
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:16,441
Now get over there.

115
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:20,978
Hi, Ms. Warden.

116
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,488
Look, sorry to bother you. But,
OK I have to... I have to tell you this.

117
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,918
Ever since I was a little kid
I had a dream of having my sports

118
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,006
talk radio show,
and a little birdie told me

119
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,564
you guys were lookin'
for someone, so i...

120
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,128
I made a demo.

121
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:36,110
OK, well...

122
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:37,488
Can't wait.

123
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,619
I'll... I'll listen to it as soon
as I get a moment.

124
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:43,842
And I recommend after you listen
to that, you have a number two.

125
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:50,950
That'd make a lot more sense when you
see the coupon inside the envelope.

126
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:58,056
You're never gonna guess
what happened with the fight.

127
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,777
You did the fetal position.
It's like trying to kick a turtle.

128
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,482
I'll get you some ice for your back.

129
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:05,072
No, dad, Dylan never showed.

130
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:08,212
I waited for him behind the cafeteria
after lunch. He never showed.

131
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:11,278
That's fantastic, Tommy.
A forfeit is as good as a win.

132
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,517
You can put that on your trophy case
with all your participant Ribbons.

133
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:18,222
See, you didn't back down,
and the bully never showed.

134
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,873
He's Tommy the tough guy now?
What do you think?

135
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,486
That's right.
Kids respect me now,

136
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:27,257
except for the ones who caught me
in the bathroom puking with relief.

137
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:30,632
What do you think of your brother now?
You proud of him, Louise?

138
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,616
Dylan didn't run away because of Tom.

139
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,464
Louise got to him first.

140
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:40,688
Louise. But Louise doesn't fight.
I mean, even when we play, like,

141
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,802
rock'em sock'em robots,
she won't push the buttons.

142
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:46,397
Her fighter just stands
there in silent protest.

143
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,882
Well, apparently Dylan was sitting
at a table, having lunch

144
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,794
when Louise came up from behind him
and whispered something in his ear.

145
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:57,058
And according to a kid who was there,

146
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:59,992
Dylan's face kind of sagged,
he looked really depressed,

147
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:01,676
and he got up, and he went home.

148
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,492
Well, what on earth did she say?

149
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:06,858
Tell why don't you tell him, Louise?

150
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:13,720
Oh, my god.

151
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,433
I'm gonna get a fruit roll-up.

152
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:24,075
That is the scariest thing
I've heard since you said, "i do."

153
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,894
Or where you said, "yeah.
That's the whole thing.

154
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:36,639
Anyway, Gary, the principal wants
to sit down with us and Louise.

155
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:39,339
Oh, my gosh.
That is really awful.

156
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,769
Where did she learn to break
a man's spirit like that?

157
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,404
Thank you so much for coming in. It was
great to meet you. I'll let you know.

158
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:53,824
That's like, the 18th

159
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:56,506
deejay hat she's interviewed.
You think she's listened to my demo yet?

160
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,368
See? I told you not
to get your hopes up.

161
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:00,914
I told you that it was not gonna work.

162
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,275
- Gary, could I see you for a second?
- I always believed in you, man.

163
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:09,927
Hi.

164
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,968
No matter what you're about
to say, I just wanna say thank you.

165
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:16,600
I respect your opinion. But thank you,
mostly. Thank you for this...

166
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,005
Check made out to Gary's house painting.

167
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,850
Yeah. It's the balance of what
I owe you for painting the station.

168
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:24,981
I know you're gonna be done in a couple
days, so I just wanted to tell you

169
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,399
- that everything looks great.
- OK. Great. Anything else?

170
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,388
The colors were vibrant.

171
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,611
The crew was courteous and smelled good.

172
00:09:37,324 --> 00:09:39,988
OK, here's the thing. I gave you my demo
a couple days ago,

173
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:42,329
and I know I'm just a guy
you hired to paint the office, but

174
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:44,918
ever since I gave you that demo I've
sort of been on pins and needles

175
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,672
around here, so excited about it, and

176
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,981
if you're not interested,
tell me you're not interested.

177
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:51,660
- I take it. Just don't string me along.
- I'm not interested.

178
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,695
You can string me along
for a little while.

179
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,558
It's OK. Really, I can be strung.

180
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:58,290
It's just,
is there any feedback you can give me?

181
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,781
I mean, did you like it?
Did you not like it? It's just...

182
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:03,550
No, no. It's not that I didn't like it.
I just... You know,

183
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,192
I didn't love it in a way

184
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:08,381
where I would say something like,
you know, "hey, I love that."

185
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:11,800
I didn't like it.

186
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:20,252
Well, then I will now look
for a graceful way to

187
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:23,375
exit your office. And i...

188
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,275
I just stepped in a tray of paint.

189
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:28,641
You know what I'll do?
I'll take my shoe off,

190
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:31,296
and that way,
I will leave your office faster.

191
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,589
I have a knot.
I can't get it out.

192
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,239
- You know, why don't I just go?
- That's probably best.

193
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,146
Man.

194
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,785
- What happened?
- What'd she say?

195
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:52,361
She's totally blowin' me off.
She didn't even listen to my demo.

196
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,296
Look at this. She didn't even open it.

197
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:58,165
Don't worry about it, gary.
Radio is a dying business anyway.

198
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,532
- Dude.
- Sorry.

199
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:08,164
I can understand not listening
to the demo,

200
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,040
I can understand not liking the demo,

201
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,564
but why would she lie
about listening to the demo?

202
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:16,147
So your question is
why would a woman lie?

203
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,078
I don't know, man.

204
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:21,904
Why would a woman
ask you to cosign a loan for a jet ski

205
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:25,319
that she ends up ridin' with your cousin
Leon, arms all wrapped around each other

206
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,720
wavin' to you on the beach
like nothin's wrong?

207
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:31,556
I ain't wavin' back.

208
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:36,521
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

209
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:41,673
You ready to go see the principal?

210
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:44,005
Yeah. Let me get my jacket.
It's in the booth.

211
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,984
- Hi. Can I help you?
- No. She doesn't need any help.

212
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:50,625
That's my, ex-wife Allison,
and this is my, my boss

213
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,551
for a little while Sasha. This is Sasha.
We have a school thing to go to.

214
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:57,497
And, while if anything
happens while I'm away,

215
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,961
Mitch is in charge.
When I'm not here, Mitch is the boss.

216
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:04,752
That's game right there!

217
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:07,662
You wanna get wasted?

218
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,720
Lady boss is into you.

219
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:15,377
Yeah. I think,
the exact opposite is true.

220
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:18,070
Come on. It's obvious.
She did the look.

221
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,568
What do you mean? She's...
Checkin' out my new six-pack?

222
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,158
You mean the pony keg?

223
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,079
Gary, she didn't look at you.
She looked at me.

224
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:32,828
When a woman is interested in a guy,
all the other women in his life

225
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:35,498
get the look.
It's very quick. It's very subtle.

226
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:38,216
If you didn't know what you were
lookin' for, you'd probably Miss it.

227
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,180
What does this look do?

228
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:42,658
Lets her know she's
dealing with a possible threat.

229
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,892
You see, in that split-second glance,

230
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:47,607
she looked into my eyes,
saw intelligence.

231
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,701
She took in my clothes
and decided I was stylish.

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,996
She saw that I take pride in
keeping toned and fit.

233
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,082
I had her worried.

234
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,388
Maybe you and you could get a room.

235
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:06,768
The principal said you don't
even have to apologize in person.

236
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:10,122
You can write the kid a note, mail him a
letter. You could do it over the phone.

237
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:13,256
- But I'm not sorry.
- You don't have to mean your apology.

238
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,608
Just fake it if it gets
people off your back.

239
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,973
You really think it's a good idea
to teach your daughter to be insincere?

240
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,005
Actually, you're right.
I'm sorry, Allison.

241
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,877
Louise, honey, I know
you don't like Dylan, OK,

242
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,451
but the principal says he's having
a rough time coping.

243
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:33,233
He just sits in front of the weather
channel saying, "it's coming.

244
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:34,796
It's coming." You know?

245
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,598
I don't want to apologize to Dylan.

246
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:40,213
Dylan doesn't have to apologize
to all the kids he picked on.

247
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:43,455
- Yeah. She's got a point there.
- Gary, hello. We're a team here.

248
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,295
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

249
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:46,668
It's so easy.

250
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,564
Louise, honey, i'm sorry, but until you
apologize, you can't go to cello

251
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:57,618
or chess club, and no going to the woos
house for pizza and logarithm night.

252
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,310
- At's not fair!
- You know what?

253
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,019
You keep up that attitude,
you're not goin' to college!

254
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,776
You think Sasha didn't listen
to my demo 'cause she's into me?

255
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,974
You know, I've been giving this some
thought. I think I got it figured out.

256
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:13,732
She's into me.

257
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,005
Yeah, you're a real genius there, Mitch.

258
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,192
That's...

259
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:21,822
Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this, Mitch.

260
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:23,851
I think there's a big
hole in your theory.

261
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:25,171
- Impossible.
- Really?

262
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,893
Look at this.
"Gary Brooks. Gary Brooks."

263
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,689
Sasha wrote my name, like,
a hundred times on there. Don't you see?

264
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:31,703
It's true.

265
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:34,699
She's really goin' out of her way
to pretend she doesn't like me.

266
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:37,828
She likes me, you dope.

267
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,292
Allison was right.
She's totally into me.

268
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,231
That's why she didn't listen to my demo.
Let's say she hires me.

269
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:46,399
It's gonna be completely
confusing in the workplace,

270
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:49,272
like am I her employee,
or am I her lover?

271
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:56,250
- Please never say, "lover," again.
- Here she comes. Act natural.

272
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,090
Hi, guys. Sorry.
I just need to grab some stuff.

273
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,041
Hey, would you excuse us for a second?

274
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,745
Yeah, sure.
I'll just...

275
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:05,749
Head out to the truck and,
grab a hammer.

276
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:14,323
I've been thinking about this whole
deejay thing. Who am I kidding?

277
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,872
I'm in way over my head.
I'd like my demo back.

278
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,752
You know, if I could find it.

279
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:24,823
I might have filed it or...
It could be in my car.

280
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:27,250
Actually, I think it's in my pants.

281
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:30,966
And I know you didn't listen to it.

282
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:34,433
OK. You know,
I'm very busy, all right?

283
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,334
I've got a hectic schedule,
and it's not like I have the time

284
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,089
to listen to every demo CD of every
contractor that comes through...

285
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,639
I think I know what's goin' on here.

286
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:48,597
You didn't listen to my demo,
because you're into me.

287
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,428
- What?
- Yeah. You're into me.

288
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:55,261
And it's OK.
Just you and me alone in this office.

289
00:15:56,714 --> 00:16:00,435
And all those people out there
who will hear me if I call out.

290
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,083
It's not what I'm talking about.

291
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,534
I found this. You've been writin'
my name all over the place,

292
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:06,680
look at this. A hundred times
you wrote "Gary Brooks.

293
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:09,580
You even made cute little
googly eyes of the double os.

294
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:14,149
- No one was supposed to see that.
- It's OK.

295
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,713
We can get through this.
You know what I'll do?

296
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:19,383
I'll stop wearin' clothes
to work that make you wild.

297
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,014
I'll keep my guns in their holster.

298
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,422
I'll take my mojo,
turn it down to low, and we'll...

299
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,110
We'll work it out together.

300
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,242
Well...

301
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:36,786
Now that my secret's out,
I may as well confess.

302
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:38,224
Lay it on me.

303
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,470
I'm terrible with names.

304
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:41,639
Come again?

305
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:46,057
I write names down over and over
so that I can remember them.

306
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,652
Did you happen to flip
the page and see these?

307
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:52,692
Henry Zangara,
Phil Werner, Anne Johnson.

308
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:54,716
The list goes on.
Tom Shinsky.

309
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,195
- Then how do you explain the look?
- I... what look?

310
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:01,433
The look... what look?
The look you gave my, ex-wife, Allison.

311
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:03,263
You were starin'at her bangs,
her clothes.

312
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:06,076
You're totally checkin' out her body.
That means you're into me.

313
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:11,086
Oh, my god. OK.
You got high with Mitch and Henry.

314
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,632
I looked at Allison
because I liked her jeans.

315
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:18,035
I thought they were cute.

316
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:19,999
Where do you get the audacity

317
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,710
to come in here
to rifle through my stuff

318
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,933
and then make these outrageous claims?

319
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,471
You know what? For years,
I've been breathing in a lot of fumes.

320
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,729
You know why I didn't
listen to your demo CD?

321
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:36,237
Because you have no chance
at getting this job.

322
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,139
Did it ever occur to you

323
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:40,619
that the guy I hire
to be my sports deejay

324
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:43,039
might actually be a sports deejay?

325
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:45,432
Curtis told me that,

326
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:48,667
but I thought he was just, you know,
trying to keep the white man down.

327
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:52,424
My suggestion to you
is that you get out there

328
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,740
and you finish the job I hired you for,

329
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:57,518
or I will have one less name to rember.

330
00:17:58,236 --> 00:17:59,764
- It's Gary...
- I know.

331
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,237
The kids home yet?

332
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,495
What's that look for?

333
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,074
Now you're not
an expert on looks anymore?

334
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,076
- What you talking about?
- What I talking about?

335
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,593
I just made a complete ass out
of myself in front of Sasha.

336
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:22,136
She wasn't looking at me.
She's not into me at all.

337
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:24,442
She was lookin' at your pants.
She likes your jeans.

338
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:27,896
Really? Well, that's so sweet.
I like what she was wearing, too.

339
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:32,016
Allison. That was the most
embarrassing moment of my life.

340
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,906
That's all you have to say to me?

341
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,781
Would it be weird if I called her?

342
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:40,410
Well?

343
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:42,360
I apologized to Dylan,

344
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:45,743
but I couldn't do the insincere thing,
so I said I was sorry.

345
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,055
Honey, we're very proud of you.
You know what that means.

346
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:51,450
Somebody gets to go to astronomy club.

347
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,059
And I've got good news, too.

348
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:58,302
After Louise apologized, Dylan came
looking for me to kick my butt again.

349
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,491
Why is that good news?

350
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,491
Cause right when I went
into the turtle position

351
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,827
I put my history book in the back of my
pants, and when Dylan kicked my butt,

352
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:07,792
shattered his leg in 5 places.

353
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:12,128
He has to be home-schooled
the rest of the year.

354
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:20,820
- No. God.
- No, no, no, no!

355
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,678
I'm not gonna ask for anything.
I'm just...

356
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,304
I'm here to apologize for,
like, 6 different things.

357
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,024
Apology accepted.

358
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,287
Look, I'm not this hard-ass, OK?

359
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,731
If we were just friends hangin' out,

360
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,255
I would say, "be a sports deejay.
Go for it."

361
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:41,296
But I am the boss here,
and everyone at this company, my dad,

362
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,469
is expecting me to fail,

363
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,651
so if I hired the guy
painting the station

364
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:49,848
to be my on-air guy, I would look like
I didn't know what I was doing.

365
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,140
Why didn't you just tell
me that in the beginning?

366
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:55,675
I'm sorry. I just haven't gotten used to
crushing people's hopes and dreams.

367
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:59,372
But now that I've done it, I feel
like I could be pretty good at it.

368
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,051
You know,
if you wanna be a sports deejay,

369
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:05,942
why don't you just start at the bottom
and work your way up?

370
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,534
Did you start at the bottom?

371
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,252
My situation is entirely different,

372
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,734
because I have a rich father

373
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:16,325
who gives me things, and you...

374
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:18,297
You don't.

375
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:22,097
So, no, I did not work my way up.

376
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,601
Look, if I could do it all over again

377
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,724
I would start at the bottom,
and I'd work my way up.

378
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:29,498
But I can't. I don't have that kind
of time, so you know what I did?

379
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,656
I took a stab in the dark.
I made a demo,

380
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:34,240
and I gotta tell you something.
I think it's a damn good one.

381
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,685
All right? And all I ask
is that you just...

382
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,407
Just put me in the mix.
That's it.

383
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:42,119
- OK. Give me your demo.
- Are you serious?

384
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:44,562
- Quick, before I change my mind.
- OK, here. Here it is.

385
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:47,828
OK, you...

386
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:50,196
Are in the mix.

387
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:52,818
Congratulations.

388
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,443
That is a big-ass mix.

389
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,916
And I'm in it.

390
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,637
You know why she did that, right?

391
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:08,880
