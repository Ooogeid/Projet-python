1
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:05,061
Hey, kids!
Your lunches are ready.

2
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:06,865
What are you doin'?

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:10,079
I'm headed back to reserve duty next
week, so I'm shippin'my stuff ahead.

4
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,715
- Why? You gonna Miss me?
- I'm gonna Miss you, but don't worry.

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,547
I'm gonna get us a real small dog so the
neighbors don't stop thinking we're gay.

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,611
All right. I still need to get socks,
deodorant,

7
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:24,165
and a case of Dottie Lane
salad dressing.

8
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:27,061
- Salad dressing?
- This stuff's amazing.

9
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,017
You could roll a bottle
of this in a cave in

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,319
Afghanistan and the insurgents'll come
with their hands

11
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,428
in the air holding forks and bowls.

12
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,517
- You guys ready or what?
- Here we go.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,356
Yeah. I got my first class
of driver's ed today.

14
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:42,443
Pretty soon I'll be driving
you to school, Louise.

15
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:46,272
I guess it's time I stopped
questioning and pick a religion.

16
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:49,628
I'm so psyched.

17
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:53,810
Driving means freedom and independence
and of course the ladies.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,473
Yep, you just summed up
why I joined the marines...

19
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:00,326
That and blowin' stuff up.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,185
Hey, guys. Gary, listen.

21
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,174
Howard's here, and you know we just
started dating, and I really like him,

22
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,644
so please don't make that joke
about how his strong grip

23
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:12,809
will come in Handy
when he's carrying all my baggage, OK?

24
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:16,150
No, this is... This is important.
I finally get to meet the guy

25
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:19,009
that's been spoiling my kids
with the box seats at the dodger games,

26
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:20,756
the designer clothes, the new bikes.

27
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,588
Is he comin' in through the door,
or should I check the chimney?

28
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:26,846
- Good morning, Louise.
- Good morning.

29
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:29,415
Howard,
this is Gary and his brother Mitch.

30
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:34,084
Gary, I've heard...
Things about you.

31
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,683
That's... That's a strong grip.
You know, that's gonna come in...

32
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:43,210
Howard is, He was pickin' us up so
I could drop the kids off at school,

33
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:46,480
and then we're going to Malibu for
breakfast. We're gonna eat on his boat.

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,050
Now it's OK to eat on a boat,

35
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,743
but I can't bring my turkey leg
on it's a small world?

36
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,339
No, but apparently
you can stash it behind a trash can

37
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:57,420
and finish it after the ride was over.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,943
Come on, kids. Go to school.

39
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,754
Hold up just a second. Tom, Louise,

40
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,998
I got present for you guys, something
you can keep here at your dad's place.

41
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:07,214
That's OK.
The kids have plenty of, you know...

42
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:09,893
It's the number one
gaming system in Amer...

43
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:19,030
I wanted to be sensitive to
the whole divorce situation,

44
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:22,390
so I got you one for here and one
you can take back to your mom's.

45
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:27,117
Cool, the sports resort game.
You can parachute over an Island

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,654
and join up with other sky
divers in formation.

47
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:31,996
- You didn't happen to get the...
- Schwing!

48
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,066
Sword attachments for the fencing game!
Oh, my god.

49
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:42,007
Thank you, but it's real not...
It's not necessary.

50
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,431
The kids have lots of toys.

51
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:45,911
I just have to say no to
the whole thing. I'm sorry.

52
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,334
What are you doing?
You're embarrassing me.

53
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:53,557
No. This is my fault, Gary.
I apologize. I should have asked you.

54
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,891
You don't have to pack it all up.

55
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,675
I mean, I'll just swing
it by your house later.

56
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:04,161
- Thank you, Mitch.
- Hey, i'll see you guys later.

57
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:05,725
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

58
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,193
- I was talkin' to my kids.
- You, too, then.

59
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:11,921
- I got first game.
- Yeah, no, no.

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,149
You get first game when he's
sleepin' with your ex-wife.

Team Subs-Addicts"

64
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:30,389
Can you believe this needleman guy?
I mean, he's known my kids 3 weeks.

65
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,940
He's buying thriemed toys
that I like more than they do.

66
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:35,775
Getting upset over nothing, Gary.

67
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:37,822
I mean, it's an awesome video game.

68
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:41,051
You can play tennis the way it was
meant to be played, on your couch...

69
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:44,026
With a beer and nachos.

70
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:47,412
You know what he's doin', right?
He's tryin' to buy your kids.

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,227
- It's jsust a couple gifts.
- Is it?

72
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,021
Let me tell you a little anecdote.

73
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:54,749
That's right.
A brother can say, "anecdote."

74
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,894
A few years ago,
I'm dating this woman, Viv,

75
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:01,493
and she's got 3 kids...
2 boys and a chick.

76
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:05,907
OK, just so you know, this is why
I never ask you to baby-sit. Go ahead.

77
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,444
I really like viv, OK,

78
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:11,445
so I figure I need her kids
to really like me, so what did I do?

79
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:14,501
I buy them this popcorn popper, one of
those fancy ones with the butter warmer.

80
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:17,359
Now, this really, really ruffles
the feathers of the ex-husband,

81
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,351
but the kids are so grateful that
they want me around all the time now.

82
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,327
So I start picking 'em up from school,
going shopping for clothes with them,

83
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,300
giving them talks about
the birds and the bees.

84
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:27,349
Pretty soon,
guess what little Kiana's callin' me?

85
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:28,680
The defendant?

86
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,761
"Dad," OK?
I'm telling you,

87
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:35,915
if you don't want him to buy your
kids' love, you gotta outdo him.

88
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,220
You don't have to do anything, Gary.
The only love he bought was mine.

89
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,731
Hey, Curtis, would you mind R.S.V.P.

90
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:46,254
-ing to this al gore fundraiser for me?
It's me plus one.

91
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,526
Sasha, you gotta get
an assistant for this stuff.

92
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:52,356
Please. My dad's in town to support
Gore, and I'm just really stressed

93
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,916
'cause he and I have
a very difficult relationship.

94
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,166
My dad and i, not gore and i.

95
00:04:57,874 --> 00:04:58,964
Gore and I are fine.

96
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:03,599
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Sign you up for a Mani-Pedi?

97
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,937
Book a massage for you?
Pick up your dress?

98
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:09,333
I would never in a million years
ask you to do something like that,

99
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,219
but now that you've offered,
thank you so much. You're a lifesaver.

100
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,808
Can I ask you a personal question?

101
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,075
Of course, guy I met 2 weeks ago
who's here to paint the station.

102
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,877
Right. OK,

103
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:25,647
when your father bought you a lot of
stuff, did that make you love him more?

104
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,163
See that, guys?
You cannot buy your kids' love.

105
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,563
What's important is being a good dad.

106
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:41,350
You believe what you want, but all I had
to do was buy those kids a Mr. Popcorn,

107
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,903
and now, if you are to believe my coffee
mug, i'm the world's greatest dad.

108
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,428
Your mug says, "female body inspector."

109
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:52,277
I'm that, too.

110
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,103
Game, set, and match.

111
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:07,329
Good game, Tv.

112
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,830
How's it goin', buddy?
How was driver's ed?

113
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:15,820
Driver's ed?

114
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,776
It was, It was... it was good.
I mean, it was.

115
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,009
It was horrifying.

116
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,170
The showed us this video about the
dangers of not driving safely. And then

117
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,773
there was just so much blood and...
and screaming, and then

118
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,842
they show this guy who was cut in half?
I don't wanna be cut in half.

119
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,465
I'm just at the age where I'm learning
what one of my halves can do!

120
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:38,197
All right. Come here.
Sit down. Sit down.

121
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:40,242
I've seen this kind
of thing before in combat.

122
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,699
Marine sees something horrible,
he can't get it out of his head

123
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:43,804
here's the key.

124
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:47,065
We've gotta get you into a car before
the trauma sets into the brain.

125
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,477
All right? Otherwise, you're always
gonna associate driving with blood.

126
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,000
The only thing I heard out
of that sentence was "trauma,

127
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,578
"brain," and "blood."

128
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,582
Listen to what i'm saying, all right?!
You don't have a choice here?!

129
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:04,535
You either kill the beast,
or the beast is gonna kill you!

130
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:08,027
You wanna be able to close your eyes
without seeing a little Tommy torso

131
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,917
running around without legs or feet?

132
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,591
Yes, I do, OK? I'll face the beast.
I'll face... I'll face it.

133
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,660
Cool. I'm gonna grab a string cheese.

134
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:23,882
- Man.
- You OK?

135
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,843
It's my fingernail.

136
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:28,282
Peeled off like a yogurt lid.

137
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:33,846
Hey, look, though. You can see my blood
pump every time my heart beats.

138
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,040
Oh, my god.

139
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:45,538
Hey, guys. How was the garlic festival?
Never mind. I could smell it.

140
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,435
It was awesome.
First of all, we had a 4-hour drive.

141
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:53,145
That was amazing.
And then we, had Garlic Food...

142
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:55,481
Garlic bread, Garlic cheese,
Garlic ice cream.

143
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,851
How'bout the Garlic ice cream?
That was awesome.

144
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,653
It was so disgusting.

145
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:03,228
Why do they put the Garlic clove
on top like a cherry? I mean, we get it.

146
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,729
How'bout the people-watching?
Wasn't that good people-watching?

147
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,918
Yeah, the guy dressed like
a Garlic bulb leered at me

148
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,937
and asked me if I worked out.

149
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:16,031
That could happen anywhere.
That could happen at a Garlic festival.

150
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:18,336
It could happen on a private yacht.
It could happen

151
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,869
other places that rich people go.

152
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:26,162
- What?
- You taking them to a free festival

153
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:28,533
didn't have anything to do
with howard, did it?

154
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,178
I want my kids to know that having a
good time doesn't have to be expensive.

155
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,747
You know what ?
Howard just wants the kids to like him,

156
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,665
and I really like him, too, so could
you please just give him a chance?

157
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:40,341
No, because he keeps spoiling my kids,
and for years,

158
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,666
I've been trying to
lower their expectations. OK?

159
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:46,596
And this guy's gonna ruin that by
giving them what they actually want.

160
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:49,409
Gary, I don't want them spoiled either,
but if Howard's,

161
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:52,224
you know, exposing them to fun things
and new experiences

162
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,741
that are a little beyond our means,
what's the harm?

163
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,662
What's the harm? The harm is you
wind up with kids showing their crotch

164
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,275
to the parazzi, right,

165
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,388
walkin' around
with little Chihuahas in purses.

166
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,105
Tom's weird enough as it is.

167
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,080
You know what? I think
someone's feeling a little insecure

168
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:10,266
and a little threatened by my new fella.

169
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,345
What, me? No, no. I'm not threatened
by your fellow. I feel sorry for him.

170
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:16,294
Like In Jaws,
how I'm frightened for Quint

171
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:18,787
when he keeps sliding
into the mouth of the shark.

172
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:22,900
- Hi, Howard.
- Hi, sweetheart.

173
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:25,536
Nauseous.

174
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:30,771
Hey, mom, Tom grabbed the shower.
Can I use yours? Hey, Howard.

175
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,941
Hey, you're just the person
I wanted to see.

176
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:35,590
I understand you got a birthday comin'up
and if you have other plans,

177
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:38,925
just let me know, buy your mom
tells me you're a fan of Yo Yo Ma.

178
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,550
I'm the president of the yo-yo maniacs.

179
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,873
It just so happens that I know Mr. Ma,

180
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:47,076
so what I thought we could do,
if you're interested,

181
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,333
is get on my private jet,
fly to New York,

182
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,928
see him in concert, then maybe
hang out with him after the show.

183
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,707
- Really?! Oh, my god! Thank you!
- You're welcome.

184
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:58,139
B... but hang on. Just a second. Gary,
is this OK with you?

185
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:02,001
What? The Yo-Yo Ma, thing?
I don't care. Yeah.

186
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,975
Here OK. Here's the thing.
It might bump up a little

187
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,056
against my plan.
I know you love Yo Yo Ma,

188
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,136
but I also know somebody else
you really love, and that's why

189
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:13,051
I have arranged for...

190
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:17,114
OK, the former vice President
of the United States, Al Gore,

191
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,348
to call you at my house
on your birthday.

192
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,504
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Thank you.

193
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:27,684
- Al Gore, Gary? Really?
- Really.

194
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,514
How do you know Al Gore?

195
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:33,369
I think the question, Allison,
is "how does Al Gore know me?"

196
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,216
OK, Gary, how does Al Gore know you?

197
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,503
That's the question.

198
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,304
I mean, Louise actually hugged the guy.
She hugged him. I...

199
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,233
I remembered Sasha had that Al Gore
event she was gonna go to,

200
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,349
so I blurted out that Al Gore
was gonna call her.

201
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:00,725
No, no. This is good.
You came up with something

202
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:04,096
that's better than needleman's punk gift
man. You outdid him. You're on top now.

203
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,635
You're right, Curtis. It's the perfect
plan, except I don't know Al Gore.

204
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:12,587
He's here for the fundraiser. Did you
ever think about just callin' his hotel?

205
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,647
Really? Where you think he's stayin',
the "hey, any lunatic in the world,

206
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:19,237
pick up a phone and call me, i'm Al Gore
I'm staying at the here I am suites?

207
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,668
No. Actually, I think he's
probably staying at the "sorry,

208
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,748
I was just trying to help
my brother out of the Jam he's in inn."

209
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,831
He's staying at the Regent Beverly
Wilshire where they're having the thing.

210
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:31,356
Screw it. I'll call him.

211
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,320
Look at this sunday brunch menu.

212
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:36,884
Crepe station?

213
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:39,907
Do not call me on sunday.

214
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,268
Al Gore's room, please.

215
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,562
Al, it's Mitch.

216
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,241
Mitch Brooks.

217
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,005
Yeah. Really?

218
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,205
What kind of sandwich?

219
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,491
I'm just kiddin'. I'm on hold.

220
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,553
Is it my imagination,
or do you guys take a lot of breaks?

221
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,560
Just tryin' to figure out what to
get my daughter for her birthday.

222
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:12,531
That funny. The guys fixing the toilets
are talking about the same thing.

223
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,139
- Really?
- No. They're fixing the toilets.

224
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:19,722
Hey, Curtis, if you need me, i'm
gonna be at the bar across the street.

225
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,048
I'm picking my dad at the
airport for the fundraiser.

226
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,250
Why goin' to the bar?

227
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,310
Cause I'm picking my dad at the airport
and heading to the fundraiser.

228
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,282
They're never gonna
put me through to him.

229
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:30,888
He's totally insulated.

230
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,614
You know, back in the day,
abe Lincoln would walk down the street,

231
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,223
and people could just walk right
up to him and shake his hand.

232
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:40,200
Or see him at the theater.

233
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,236
Exactly.
He was accessible.

234
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:47,914
All right.
I know what I gotta do.

235
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,951
I sneak into the Al Gore event.

236
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:52,446
I make believe i'm Sasha's plus-one.

237
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:56,107
I give Al Gore a note to call my
daughter, and I hope he does me a solid.

238
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:58,930
This is a bad idea.
Let me tell you an anecdote.

239
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,058
That's right.
It's twofer tuesday on anecdotes.

240
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,847
I went to the movie
one time to go see Rush Hour 2,

241
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:08,669
and I thought to myself, hey,
why not sneak into another movie?

242
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:10,877
Long story short,
they confiscated my popcorn,

243
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,071
my malted milk balls and kicked me out.

244
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,036
I had to walk home hungry, humiliated,

245
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,460
and wondering who Bridget Jones chose.

246
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:23,134
He's right, Gary.
It's Risky.

247
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,667
It can't be done. I'm in.

248
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,264
What?

249
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,311
No. You're...
That's nice,

250
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:32,801
but that'd be great if it was plus-two,
Mitch, but it's not plus-two.

251
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,035
It's plus-one.
Gotta go it alone.

252
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:38,476
Great. Guy with no experience, no traing

253
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:41,173
is gonna stumble into something
he's totally unprepared for.

254
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:43,848
You know what we call
that in the marines? The army.

255
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,202
Thanks for taking me driving,
uncle Mitch.

256
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:53,378
See how safe this is?
No blood. No guts.

257
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,370
Just an easy drive to the post office
so I can mail my stuff to the base.

258
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,624
I can't believe you borrowed a Humvee.
I feel like a Kardashian.

259
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,515
Yeah, the motor pool sergeant over
at Camp Pendleton let me borrow

260
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,302
it for this case of Dottie Lane.

261
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,447
You know,
this makes me feel kind of powerful.

262
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:12,494
You should try it with
the machine gun on top.

263
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:16,189
Pickin' off goats,
shootin' up abandoned trucks...

264
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,421
That'll put a rise in your Levis.

265
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,833
Uncle Mitch, this guy wants
to go around me. What do I do?

266
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,933
It's all right. Just let him go on by.
Just let him go on by.

267
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:29,402
See, there he goes.

268
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:36,291
Just try to think about what makes
driving great... You know, the freedom,

269
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:37,691
the independence,

270
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,102
the hot, young females...

271
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,825
Lying to their fathers,

272
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:46,176
sneaking out so they can meet you
at the local diner for a burger...

273
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:47,468
Uncle Mitch. Mitch.

274
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:51,671
Hoping you notice their tight sweater,
but worried it makes them a bad girl.

275
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,552
Uncle Mitch. There's a guy who wants
to pull out. What do I do?

276
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:57,792
Hit the brakes!

277
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,724
Oh, my god!
I'm cut in half!

278
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,803
- I'm cut in half!
- Oh, my god!

279
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:04,944
I'm cut in half!

280
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,936
OK, calm down, Tom!

281
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,780
- Tommy, it's just salad dressing.
- No. This is my blood.

282
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,449
It's salad dressing, all right?
You're fine.

283
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:16,242
It's the salad dressing.

284
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,458
It's the salad dressing.

285
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,081
- That's good.
- It's salad dressing.

286
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:23,502
It's, it's...

287
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:39,163
- How you doin'? I'll have a beer.
- Yeah, what can I get you, sir?

288
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,803
- What time's Al Gore gonna show up?
- Should be pretty soon.

289
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,661
Oh, good.
How much do I owe you?

290
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,929
It's an open bar, sir.
These things usually are.

291
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,258
Yeah, I know.
I meant, for your tip.

292
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,715
And now that I see how rude you are,
forget it.

293
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,629
Ahi Tuna Lollipop?

294
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,935
Did you just offer me a fish lollipop?

295
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,694
It's sushi-grade Tuna.

296
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:04,045
That's OK. I'll wait for the Salmon
ding dong guy to come around.

297
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,097
Oh, my gosh.

298
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,459
- Needleman. What?
- Hey, I wanted to thank you.

299
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:17,197
You mentioned Al Gore the other
day, and it really inspired ally and

300
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:20,422
I to get involved and come to this event
but I did not expect to see you here.

301
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:23,061
That's great. OK, but listen.
Allison cannot know that I'm...

302
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:25,933
Ally! Look who's here!
It's Gary! He's right here!

303
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:29,610
What are you doing here?

304
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,124
Learning about the environment.
Having some beers.

305
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,575
- How did you get in here?
- What do you mean?

306
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:39,493
I'm sorry.
I meant how did you get in here?

307
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:42,025
Gary, you can't afford to do this.

308
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:43,452
This is our planet.

309
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,588
- I can't afford not to do this.
- OK, you know what?

310
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,375
I'm gonna punch you in the throat
unless you tell me what you're doing.

311
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,821
My, my boss, she's very cool
and pretty, and she brought me.

312
00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:53,719
She thought i'd be fun
to have here with her.

313
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,329
Now I know you're lying.

314
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:59,712
You can't get your head around the fact
there's a new man in the kids' lives.

315
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:03,793
I mean, OK, so maybe if Al Gore calls
Louise, it doesn't change anything.

316
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,983
Howard is still gonna be here,
and why is that such a bad thing, Gary?

317
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,589
He's a really good person.

318
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,968
OK, let me explain it to you.
Louise is my daughter,

319
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,542
OK, and for years,

320
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,562
she's always looked at me like I was
the guy that can move heaven and earth,

321
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,314
and I'm not gonna let some guy
in a suit that pulls Yo Yo Ma

322
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:21,282
out of his pocket
take that look away from me.

323
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:23,441
That's my look.
I earned that look, Allison.

324
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,015
No one is gonna steal
that look from you.

325
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,846
You're right. You're darn right,
they're not, 'cause I'm not leavin' here

326
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,895
until I give Al Gore a little note.
I will not leave.

327
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:35,094
I'm sorry.
What do you mean my plus-one is here?

328
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,073
- Oh, my gosh. I have to leave.
- What?

329
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,161
Hide me.

330
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,444
- For once, I wish your ass was bigger.
- What?

331
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:48,098
Ladies and Gentlemen, former vice
President of the United States,

332
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,350
Al Gore.

333
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,647
Good.

334
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,070
- Hey, Gore, I got something for you.
- Gun! Gun!

335
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:58,727
Oh, my gosh. Is this necessary?
The guy didn't even win.

336
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,412
You keep quiet. Get him out of
here and lock him in a room.

337
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:02,518
Yes, sir.

338
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,577
I told you you were gonna need me.

339
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,717
Here you go, Louise.

340
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,404
You're gonna bring that cello
all the way to New York?

341
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,213
Yeah, 'cause I want Yo Yo Ma to sign it.

342
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:22,305
OK. Just it's a long way to travel with
a cello for a guy to write 6 letters.

343
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:25,157
Here you go.

344
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:28,726
We OK?

345
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,319
You feeling better
since the dressing incident?

346
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,999
Well, I thought I was until

347
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,219
yesterday, when the cafeteria lady
put dressing on my salad,

348
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,416
and I wake up in the nurse's office next
to a kid who picked his nose too hard

349
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,776
I'm proud of you, Tommy. You've come
a long way. You used to be that kid.

350
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:51,974
Sneaking into that event was the
stupidest thing you have ever done,

351
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,288
and I'm including the time you put
that hermit crab on your nipple.

352
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,599
Are you ever gonna let that go?
After 5 minutes, the crab let go.

353
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:05,946
What are you gonna tell her?

354
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,327
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

355
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,711
Hi, sweetie.

356
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:16,900
I can't get Al Gore
to call you on your birthday.

357
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,541
It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.
I know you're disappointed.

358
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:21,326
Really?

359
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:23,328
But,

360
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:26,892
this is what I got you originally.

361
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,276
It's a photo of you and I on that beach,
and we were sitting on the rocks,

362
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,862
and we were really laughing,
'cause the dolphins and the seals,

363
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:36,118
it they looked like they were smiling,
and we were wavin' at'em. Remember that?

364
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:37,258
I totally remember.

365
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,951
That was one of
the best days I ever had.

366
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,218
Yeah, me, too.

367
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,872
- Thank you, daddy. I love it.
- I love you, sweetie.

368
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,713
Louise, honey,
we can go to New York another time.

369
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:53,448
If you wanna stay here and celebrate
your birthday with, you should do that.

370
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,572
- I...
- No, no. Listen,

371
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,437
go to New York. I mean, this is
the opportunity of a lifetime, OK?

372
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,543
And tell Yo-Yo I said Yo, right?

373
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,611
All right. But
most importantly, make sure

374
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:08,446
you're really nice to Mr. Needleman.
This is a great thing he's doing, OK?

375
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:12,789
All right, let's saddle up. I wanna get
to the airport a couple hours early.

376
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,700
Why? It's a private jet.
You just walk right on the plane.

377
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:19,828
I know. I wanna hang at the bar and
watch the commercial fliers stress out.

378
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:24,901
Hello hey. Hello?

379
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:29,986
Hold on one second.

380
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,482
It's Al Gore.

381
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:34,715
Hello.

382
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:36,494
Yes, this is Louise.

383
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,733
Hi, Mr. Gore.

384
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:40,143
Thank you, daddy.

385
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:41,531
You're amazing.

386
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,115
Is that your look?

387
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,185
Yeah. That's my look.

388
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:50,080
How did this happen, Gary?

389
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:52,956
The secret service guy must have
grabbed the note and slipped it

390
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,940
- to Al Gore when he had a free moment.
- Guess what, Mr. Gore.

391
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,970
I'm flying to New York in a priva.

392
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:00,633
I mean I'm driving there

393
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,964
in a fuel-efficient hybrid.
