1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,400
Hi, Gary.
Hi Dad.

2
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:06,401
Hi sweetie.

3
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:08,202
Oh, wow. Reading the newspaper.

4
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,103
I'm impressed.
I'm just seeing what's on TV.

5
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,404
Oh, my gosh.
Jon Cryer documentary.

6
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:16,901
"from duckie to emmy."

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:17,969
Hmm.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,204
Uh, listen,
Gary, we have to
talk to Louise,

9
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:21,305
But first we have
to deal with Tom,

10
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:23,507
Who, if he
would stop pouting
in the car,

11
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:25,475
Would come out
and tell you
what happened.

12
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,244
Uh, Louise,
would you get daddy
a beer, please?

13
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,845
Yeah, sure.

14
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,591
Gary, do you
really think
it's a good idea

15
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:33,128
To have Louise get
your drinks for you?

16
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:35,093
Yes.

17
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:37,503
Um, I used
to get them myself.

18
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,102
This way, I don't
have to get them myself.

19
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,041
It's totally bogus.

20
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,108
Take it easy, man.
What's goin' on?

21
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,786
Well, I tried out for
the Lakeside wrestling club.

22
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:48,867
Lakeside wrestling?

23
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:50,660
Hey, just like
your old man, huh?

24
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,207
Yeah.
All right. How'd it go?

25
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,331
I'll tell you
how it went.

26
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,442
Ok, I wrestled
the coach's son,

27
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:56,255
And I totally pinned him,
but then I got cut,

28
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,810
And he had
a spot on the team.

29
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,287
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

30
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:00,907
If you pin, you're in.
That's how it's
always worked.

31
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:02,692
Who's the coach
over there?

32
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:04,011
Uh, Joe Campbell.
You remember him
from high school?

33
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,961
Soup? I remember
soup Campbell.

34
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:09,652
I'm pretty sure
he likes to be called Joe now.

35
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,227
Ah, well,
that's too bad for soup,

36
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:12,509
Because unfortunately
in the real world,

37
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,084
You don't outrun
a perfectly good nickname

38
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:16,365
Just 'cause
you wanna go back
to your real name.

39
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,545
Works both ways, too.

40
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:20,460
I went to school with
a kid named Wang Chin.

41
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,073
He begged
for a nickname.

42
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,325
Yeah. Well, I totally
pinned him, and it's not fair.

43
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:26,837
Don't worry. I'll talk
to soup Campbell.

44
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:27,877
He owes me a favor.

45
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:29,183
We wrestled together
in high school.

46
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,362
Let's just say, uh,
I did him a solid, ok?

47
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:33,140
You do your homework.
I'll straighten it out.

48
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:34,145
All right?

49
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:36,056
Here, daddy.

50
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,034
Ah, daddy's little girl.
Look at that.

51
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:41,347
I hope you're happy
when Louise decides

52
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:43,191
To tend bar
at Dublin's Pub.

53
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:44,634
Are you--
is that someth--

54
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:46,910
Is that something
she's shown interest in?

55
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:49,053
No. No. Man.

56
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:51,063
On that note,
Louise, I'm gonna

57
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:53,776
Show your father
your history test.

58
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:56,319
Ohh. Wait. You got a "d"
on your history test?

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,094
You're the smartest kid
in the class.

60
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,399
I don't know
how it happened,

61
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,707
But it was bound to
eventually,

62
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,616
Just like when you say Tom
is due to get an "A" someday.

63
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,790
Law of averages, right?

64
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,203
It's what we're
all countin' on.

65
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,878
Here. Look, uh,
honey, it's--

66
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,853
It's unfamiliar
territory,

67
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:13,725
But I guess we're
supposed to impose

68
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,399
Some--some kind
of a punishment, right?

69
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,306
But how do you
punish Louise?

70
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,580
Take away her books?
Make her play?

71
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:22,458
Hey, Tommy, if you
came home with a "D,"

72
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,265
How would we punish you?

73
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,805
Uh, probably
somewhere
in the area

74
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,346
Of no video games,
phone, tv until
my grades improve.

75
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:31,256
But that depends on
how much sass I'm
dishin' your way.

76
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:33,230
Uh, ok, Louise,

77
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,370
So you're
gonna get
the Tom special.

78
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,310
Uh, you can dish
a little sass,

79
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:39,183
Because that
comes with
the package.

80
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:43,263
[sighs] that sounds
very appropriate. Thank you.

81
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,233
Ok...

82
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:47,443
Something is
going on with her.

83
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:48,580
I'm really worried.

84
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:49,583
I don't know.

85
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:52,159
Drugs? Pot?

86
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:55,768
I shouldn't. Uh-uh.

Hey, soup.

90
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:09,397
Hey, guy, name's Joe.

91
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,800
No one's called me
soup since--well, well.

92
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,802
Gary Brooks.

93
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:18,672
How you been, man?

94
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:19,706
Me? Not bad. Not bad.

95
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,174
You got your own
sports radio show.

96
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:22,576
Yes, I do.
Dream come true.

97
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,577
You listen to it?

98
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,245
Yeah, really not my thing.

99
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm all about coaching here

100
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:29,917
And holdin' down the fort
at Valencia Public Storage.

101
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,218
You lookin' to streamline?

102
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:34,755
I can put you in a 10-by-12
for 75 bucks a month,

103
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,956
And that's climate controlled.

104
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:37,691
I'm divorced, soup.

105
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:40,361
I, uh--I own nothing.

106
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:41,995
I came by to talk to you

107
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,397
About my son Tommy,
Tommy Brooks.

108
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,566
He said he tried out
for the wrestling team.

109
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:46,867
I was wondering
what happened.

110
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:49,269
Yeah. I want you to know I did
everything I could for him.

111
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,737
It broke my heart
to see him fail.

112
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,404
Uh, fail. That's--
that's the thing.

113
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:54,106
He--he said
he pinned your son.

114
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:55,741
Heh heh heh heh.

115
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:56,876
Pin's an exaggeration.

116
00:03:56,877 --> 00:04:00,011
It's more like he
held him down for 3 seconds.

117
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,646
However you want
to explain it, soup,

118
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:03,813
My son beat your kid.

119
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:05,982
He deserves to be
on the team, you know?

120
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,083
Yeah, I just felt
in the long run,

121
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:09,649
My son donny
has more potential.

122
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,317
All right,
for the sake of argument,

123
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,652
Let's not go by your feelings
and go with maybe--

124
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,553
I don't know--logic.
My son beat your son.

125
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,188
He deserves to be on the team.

126
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,257
Sorry. 12 spots,

127
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,325
12 wrestlers,
one broken heart.

128
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,627
Tough nuts, huh?

129
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:27,696
I didn't wanna
bring this up, soup,

130
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:28,697
But, uh--ahem.

131
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:30,498
You owe me.

132
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:31,933
How do I owe you?

133
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:33,400
Senior year,
I let you beat me

134
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,668
So you can
come to states

135
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:35,936
With the rest of us,
remember?

136
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:38,138
You're crazy.
I straight-up beat your ass.

137
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,406
What?! I let you win.
You begged me.

138
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:42,375
Y-you said your dad
would kick your ass

139
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,843
If you didn't
get to state.

140
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:45,811
Sorry. I don't
remember it that way.

141
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:47,779
I guess we just
agree to disagree.

142
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,547
Uh, yeah. No. No.
We--we don't.

143
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,116
We don't agree to disagree.

144
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:53,417
I completely
threw that match for you.

145
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,818
If we wrestled in real life,

146
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,653
You wouldn't score one point
against me. You know it.

147
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:58,321
My son Tommy deserves
to be on the team.

148
00:04:58,322 --> 00:04:59,489
He beat your kid.

149
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,892
Well, he didn't beat him
enough to make the team.

150
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:05,793
I'm sorry. Donny's just
a better wrestler.

151
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:08,095
Dad.

152
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm tired. Can I go home
and watch tv now?

153
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,768
That depends.
How many'd you do?

154
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:18,270
3.

155
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:20,272
You did 3 push-ups?

156
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:22,140
Candy bars.

157
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:26,477
You "did"
3 candy bars?

158
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:29,680
Get out of here.
Don't come back

159
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,081
Until you've done
20 push-ups.

160
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,783
It's not fair.
I hate wrestling.

161
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:36,452
Look, this is ridiculous.

162
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:39,321
My son beat your son.
He deserves to be on the team.

163
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,289
You're not gonna
get away with this, soup.

164
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,158
Wait. We have soup?

165
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:50,664
You know why
he's doin' this, right?

166
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,732
Because every time
he looks at you or Tommy,

167
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,868
It's gonna remind him
of that moment in his life
when it counted most

168
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,270
And he couldn't get it done.
He's feeling shame, man.

169
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,673
Well, you know
how I feel about
shame, Curtis.

170
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:04,042
I think as soon
as something happens
in your life,

171
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:05,910
You just let it go,
forget about it

172
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:07,077
Like it never
even happened.

173
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:08,145
You're on.

174
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:09,546
I wanted to talk
about something

175
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:10,881
That happened
20 years ago.

176
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,650
I let this guy win
a wrestling match

177
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:16,885
'cause I was being
nice, and now he
resents me for it,

178
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:18,386
So he's taking it
out on my son.

179
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:20,054
'cause I was being
so we're talkingw he
about unfairme for it,

180
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:22,156
Coaching practices
in children's sports.

181
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,058
Who's got a take?
Let's hear it.

182
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:25,293
We got Aaron in Chino.

183
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:27,829
Aaron,
you are on the air.
What do you got for me?

184
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,364
Yeah, a similar thing
happened to my kid
in little league

185
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:31,998
Because I stole
the coach's wife.

186
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,835
You know who gets hurt?

187
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:36,803
The kids do.

188
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:38,571
Yeah, that's
exactly right, Aaron.

189
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,572
Except in my case,
where the coach got hurt

190
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:43,041
When I showed up
to the game with a tire iron--

191
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,209
Ok, thank you, Aaron.

192
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,843
All right, let'so
to another call.

193
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:50,345
We have s.C. In--
what is this?
Wine country?

194
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:55,582
Soup: Yeah, as in
stop whining about your kid
when he doesn't make the cut.

195
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,017
Well, well, well.

196
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,721
Looks like we got soup Campbelll
on the line,

197
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:02,823
Aka the weasel
who blackballed my son

198
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:05,825
From makin'
the wrestling team,
even though I let him

199
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,793
Beat me in high school
so his sorry rear end

200
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,828
Could go to state
with the rest of us.

201
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,364
I thought you didn't
listen to my show, soup.

202
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,066
I'm sick of you
claiming you let me win.

203
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,367
Not only did I beat you then.

204
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,069
I'd be glad to give you
another beating now.

205
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,804
Soup, as much
as I'd love to drive
your face into the mat,

206
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:24,772
I hate to break it
to you, but I'm
a grown man now, ok?

207
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:27,340
A grown man now would
strap on his singlet and dance.

208
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,542
What am I supposed
to do with this guy?

209
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:31,843
The man is
callin' you out.

210
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,111
You can't host
a sports show

211
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:35,012
And then back down
when someone steps to you.

212
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:37,914
Soup: What's it
gonna be, Brooks?
You gonna sac up?

213
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,148
You gonna change
the name of your show

214
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:41,783
To "the score
with fairy Brooks"?

215
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:44,051
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Timeout, soup.

216
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,385
You callin' me a fairy?

217
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:48,855
Hey, if the wings fit
and the wand's tiny...

218
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:52,959
Ok, soup,
you wanna go,
we'll go.

219
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,660
But after I pin
your ass,

220
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:57,862
My son Tommy is
on that wrestling team.
You follow me?

221
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,231
You got it.
Bring your "a" game,

222
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:00,632
'cause this soup's
about to boil over.

223
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,901
Good! I hope
it does boil over,

224
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:04,669
'cause I'm gonna
bring the spoon,

225
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,705
And I'm gonna eat you
like you're

226
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:08,976
The most tastiest soup
that ever existed.

227
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:13,580
Ok, Louise, there was
a famous division

228
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,582
Between the north
and the south

229
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,617
In the civil war
called the...

230
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:19,719
No clue.

231
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,755
Uh, Mason...

232
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,424
Mason-dix...

233
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,525
Mason-dixie chicks.

234
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:27,492
No!

235
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:30,094
Louise, no. I--
I don't get it.

236
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:32,930
You--you're
a straight-a student
in every other subject.

237
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:35,232
Mom, maybe we just found
the one thing I'm not good at.

238
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:38,201
Maybe we all need
to accept the fact that
I'm not the perfect kid.

239
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:41,737
No. Louise, you are
the perfect child since
the day you were born.

240
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,572
Your head was shaped
like an oval,

241
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,141
And you pointed your
toes on the way out.

242
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:48,509
Hey, is Tom home?

243
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,211
Uh, no, not yet.
Honey, could you

244
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:51,712
Excuse us just
for a second?

245
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:52,747
Yeah, sure.

246
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:55,082
[sighs] ok, something
is happening with her.

247
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,418
I mean, she doesn't
know her history,

248
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,753
But I--I actually think
she's just pretending.

249
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:01,687
Why do you think
everybody has an agenda?

250
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,088
Maybe she
doesn't know her stuff.

251
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,356
Not everyone's
workin' an angle,

252
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,157
Like, uh, the salesgirl
at Victoria Secret

253
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:08,325
That you said was
trying to hit on you

254
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:10,360
'cause she liked
the way your bra fit.

255
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:13,063
Ok, I'm sorry.
I didn't imagine that, Gary, ok?

256
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,731
She slipped a wine cooler
in my dressing room

257
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:20,502
And told me that
my bra would look better
on the floor of her Miata, ok?

258
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,104
Look, Louise,
she knows the stuff,

259
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,505
But she's faking it,
and I don't know why.

260
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,506
I don't know.

261
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,474
Maybe she's, uh,
tired of the pressure

262
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:29,710
Of trying to be perfect
all the time.

263
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:30,944
I--I know the feeling.

264
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,779
I'd love a day off.

265
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,748
I'd love to see
a day on, gar.

266
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:37,716
Hey, thanks a lot, dad.

267
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:39,084
You completely
humiliated me at school.

268
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:40,652
Wait. Honey, hang on.
What's wrong? What happened?

269
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:43,221
Dad went on the radio
show and said he would
wrestle my coach

270
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:45,589
And if he wins, that I
get a spot on the team.

271
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,725
Now everyone at school's
saying the only
way I can get in

272
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,293
Is if my dad fights
my battles for me.

273
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:50,693
This is
a good thing, Tommy.

274
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:52,728
I beat your coach,
I settle an old score,

275
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:54,363
Plus you get
on the team.
It's a win-win.

276
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,631
I'm just tryin'
to help you out.

277
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,199
Yeah, well,
I don't want your help.

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,135
If you fighting my battles
is the only way I can get in,

279
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,036
I don't wanna be on at all.

280
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:03,871
Whoa. What's up
with that guy?

281
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,173
He was full
of thank-yous

282
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:07,507
When I helped him
pull his head out
of that pumpkin.

283
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:11,778
Ok. Look, I know
this is the last thing
you wanna hear right now,

284
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,080
But I think
you have to back down
from this fight, Gary.

285
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,715
Tom's feelings are
what's important here.

286
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,949
I can't back down,
allison.

287
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,184
I'll totally
lose my rep.
I can't lose my rep.

288
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:23,754
Gary, I know backing down
is the hardest thing
in the world for you.

289
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:24,888
Oh, you're dead wrong,

290
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,624
And I'll never
admit to that.

291
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,426
All right,
I'll back down.
All right.

292
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,361
I'll go talk to soup.
I'll take care of it.

293
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:34,796
Good. Good.
You're doing the right thing,
and you're a good father, Gary.

294
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:38,465
By the way, how did,
uh, Tom's head end up
in a pumpkin in the first place?

295
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,467
Ha! I dared him.

296
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:46,908
Hey, soup,
we gotta talk.

297
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,210
What do you want, Brooks?

298
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,244
All right.

299
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:52,179
You here to beg for mercy?

300
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,215
No. I'm here
to back out of the match
for my son's sake, ok?

301
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:56,382
Oh, that's so touching.

302
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,184
I think I just
lactated myself.

303
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:00,119
All right, knock it off.
Here's the thing.

304
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,621
I know every single
resentment you have
about high school

305
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:05,590
A-and me,
you're taking it out
on my son. It's not ok.

306
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,959
I'm gonna go on the air.
I'm gonna tell
all my listeners

307
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,226
That I'm backin' out
of the match,

308
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:10,728
And I'll take
whatever repercussions
come with it,

309
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:13,697
As long as you let my
son try out for the team
fair and square, ok?

310
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,198
All right, I'll do that.

311
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:17,033
As long as you announce
to all your fans

312
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,168
That not only are you
a quitter, you're a liar.

313
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:22,003
You tell 'em I won
that match in high school
fair and square.

314
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,672
But you didn't.

315
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:24,773
Duh.

316
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:27,342
That's why
I want you to say it.

317
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,110
Fine. I'll do it.

318
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:31,112
Ok. I'll give Tom
another tryout,

319
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:34,481
But this time, it's not
gonna be against
my load of a son.

320
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:37,117
He's gotta beat
the best wrestler
in his weight class.

321
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:38,985
All right.
It's a deal.

322
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,988
Oh, uh, hey, soup...

323
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:46,891
Remember junior year,
we had that crazy
outbreak of jock itch?

324
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:49,093
The one that kept us
out of divisionals.

325
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:50,328
You know
who that started with?

326
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,429
Who?
Your mom.

327
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:00,837
Gary: Look, there comes
a time in every man's life

328
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:04,306
Where he has to bite
the bullet and he
just has to admit

329
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,441
That he's been wrong
about something for years.

330
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,976
This better be
about me.

331
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,078
I said on the radio
that I let soup Campbell

332
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,647
Win a wrestling match
against me in 1988.

333
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:16,550
The truth is soup Campbell
beat me, Gary Brooks,

334
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,851
Fair and square.

335
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:20,921
Wow. I can't believe
how well he's handling this.

336
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:23,790
So the match is off,

337
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,060
Because I am both
a liar and a quitter.

338
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,028
[no audio]

339
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:35,033
Daniel, don't chicken out
on me now.Liar and a quitter.

340
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:38,236
If you lock in a "c"
and I manage a "d,"

341
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,269
Everything will go
according to plan.

342
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,937
Do I have your word?

343
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:42,904
Good.

344
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:45,240
Did you see
"Jersey Shore" last night?

345
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:47,008
Snooki is a hot mess.

346
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:50,511
Ok. Gotta go. Bye.

347
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:51,579
Hi, Louise.

348
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,914
Oh, hi, mom. I'm gonna
go do my homework.

349
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,682
No, no. No, you're not.
Listen, um...

350
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:58,551
I need some help
with some U.S.
History questions,

351
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:00,553
So, uh, can you sit?
Yeah.

352
00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:02,188
Um, so Lewis and Clark,

353
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,455
They died
in the Alamo, right?

354
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,489
Uh, I--I think so.

355
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,325
Yeah. Yeah. And you know
George Washington,

356
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,960
When he
freed the slaves,

357
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:14,330
Was that before
or after he invented
the light bulb?

358
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:16,932
Um, I- couldn't tell you
one way or the other.

359
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,133
Hmm.
Ok.

360
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,535
Hey, you--you know
who was a pretty
good president?

361
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:22,303
Nixon.

362
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,873
Yeah, if you like a leader
who escalated a questionable war

363
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,440
By launching
an offensive into Cambodia

364
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:30,809
After winning the election
on a secret plan to end
that very war.

365
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,077
But you might be right.

366
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,211
Oh, gosh!

367
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,514
Come on, Louise. I know
you know your history.

368
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,048
Why are you
pretending you don't?

369
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,582
We're trying to help
our friend Marjorie.

370
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,950
Our class is on a curve,
and some of our grades

371
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,319
Are so high that she
might fail and get held back.

372
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,686
Honey,
you're a good friend,

373
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,821
Ok, but you can't
let your grades suffer.

374
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:47,988
If you wanna help her,

375
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:50,190
Why don't you
offer to tutor her
after school?

376
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:53,025
That's not going to be enough.
She's a terrible test taker.

377
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:55,660
You know what?
That's the only way I'm
gonna let you help her.

378
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,529
Ok? She's gonna
have the same
problems next year.

379
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,330
What are you gna do,
tank your tests again?

380
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,933
Uh, no way.
Next year, colleges start
looking at transcripts.

381
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:04,170
I'm going to drop her
like a hot rock.

382
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,571
Oh. Good.

383
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:07,639
All right, so let me
teach you some
takedowns, ok?

384
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,044
Hey, dad, if I wanna get
on the wrestling team,
I wanna do it myself.

385
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:12,345
Ok, but you
gotta be prepared,

386
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:14,046
'cause you don't know
what I went through to--

387
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:15,814
You're gonna
make the team.
You just gotta win.

388
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,815
Let me show you
some takedowns,
show you some moves,

389
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,783
Show you what it's lik
to be real man.

390
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:22,619
Be a real man.
Ok. Curtis, get down
on your hands and knees.

391
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,720
You...

392
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:33,928
Just a reminder. We have
to see each other
at work on Monday. Ok?

393
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:36,797
Just help me out here.
I'm gonna show my son
some moves.

394
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:39,665
All right, son,
the key to establishing
dominance in a match

395
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,834
Is you gotta really
ride your man.

396
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:43,403
Ride him good, all right?

397
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:44,404
Control his hips.

398
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,072
Make sure you're
the boss of his hips.

399
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:49,074
You stay back
behind his bottom, where
you can control everything.

400
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:50,675
Don't be afraid
to throw the cross-face.

401
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:54,177
Really get it in there.
You can feel his lips
right up against your skin.

402
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:56,478
Take your knuckles.
Dig it into his hips.

403
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,713
Aah! Come on! Hey!

404
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,914
Man, I might wanna
have kids someday.

405
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,082
All right.

406
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,850
Wait. You're gonna
have kids with your hips?

407
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,151
Yeah, man.
I--I need my hips

408
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,919
To do the thing
to get the kid.

409
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,087
All right.

410
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:11,724
All right, get up.
Come on. Let's go.

411
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,994
Let's just go over
what we learned, ok?

412
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:16,162
Yeah, I got it, dad.

413
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:17,463
Hand control,
stay off my back,

414
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:18,998
And if I'm doin'
the fireman's carry,

415
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,566
Don't be afraid
to shoot the crotch.

416
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,400
You gotta shoot
the crotch, right?

417
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,401
Bump, bump.

418
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:24,468
Both: Shoot the crotch!

419
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,036
You gotta shoot it
in there.

420
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,871
Go do some homework
or somethin', ok?

421
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:29,072
He doesn't understand.
It's killin' me

422
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,407
That I had to backut
of that match with--with soup.

423
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,508
It's makin' me nuts.

424
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,943
Yeah, but you don't want
Tom to win for you.

425
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:36,711
You want Tom
to win for him.

426
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:37,679
I understand that,

427
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
But let me
tell you somethin'.

428
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:39,847
I would love a piece
of that soup guy.

429
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:41,382
I would love a piece
of that soup guy.
I know.

430
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:42,383
I know.
All right.

431
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:43,584
See you later.
Thanks for helping out.

432
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,252
No problem, brother.
Hey, just for the record,

433
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,688
When my hand slipped
off your hip, I was
goin' for your ankle.

434
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:50,223
We don't need to talk
about it. It just--
it never happened.

435
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,793
All right, son, don't forget
that fireman's carry.

436
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:55,594
Shoot the crotch, ok?
Ok, yeah.

437
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:58,363
'cause whenever
you're in there,
keep your back straight.

438
00:15:58,364 --> 00:15:59,363
Shoot the crotch.
Ok.

439
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:01,164
Just shoot it
right up there, all right?

440
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,634
Allison, why don't
you come on over here
and help us out?

441
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:06,936
Hasn't my crotch done
enough for this family?

442
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:09,505
Uh, honey,
uh, no pressure,

443
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:11,807
But here comes
a very pretty girl.

444
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:14,042
Hey. I'm Jessica.

445
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:15,343
Are you wrestling next?

446
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,578
Uh, yeah. I'm Tom.
Are you, uh--
you gonna watch?

447
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,946
Yeah, I got
a really good seat,
on top of you

448
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:21,514
In the middle
of the mat.
Oh.

449
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,750
Well,
that sounds awesome,

450
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,218
But I gotta wrestle
someone first.

451
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,522
Um, honey,

452
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,625
I think you're
wrestling her.

453
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,160
Oh, god.

454
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,295
Dad, I'm wrestling
a girl?

455
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,131
Ok, you didn't
train me for this.

456
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,767
How am I supposed to shoot
the crotch, all right?

457
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,268
In health class,

458
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,803
They told me to ask
permission before
I shoot the crotch.

459
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,138
Soup,
what the heck's
goin' on here?

460
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,706
You tryin'
to embarrass my kid
or what?

461
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,841
You said you wanted him
to do it on his own,

462
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,443
So I put him up against
the best wrestler on the team.

463
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:56,378
That's Jessica. But now
that I think about it,

464
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:58,646
If he loses to a girl,
that'd be pretty embarrassing.

465
00:16:58,647 --> 00:16:59,814
Oops.

466
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:03,084
All right, Tommy, big deal.

467
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:04,619
You're wrestling a girl.
Just one thing.

468
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,321
Don't let it
get in the way, ok?

469
00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:08,723
Ok, dad,
I don't know how much
you know about girls,

470
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,259
But there's
more than a few things
that can get in the way.

471
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:16,596
All right, shake hands.

472
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,932
And wrestle.

473
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:20,933
Gary: Easy.

474
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:21,934
Easy, guys.

475
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,568
All right,
shoot it, Tommy!

476
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,602
Shoot!
Ok!

477
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:25,537
Take it.

478
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:26,771
But be
a gentleman,
honey.

479
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,374
Ow. Ow.
You're hurting me.

480
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,809
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry. Oh, god!

481
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,342
No!

482
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:35,744
[blows whistle]

483
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:36,811
Winner!

484
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,113
No!

485
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:40,381
Uh, honey, honey,

486
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:43,384
Uh, why don't we get
some sweatpants on you?

487
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,385
I think Jessica
realizes how much

488
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:47,920
You enjoyed the match.
There you go.

489
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:51,090
That didn't take long.

490
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:53,025
Ah, I'm sorry, dad.
I know how much

491
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:55,094
You humiliated yourself
for me to get this shot.

492
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:58,630
Plus I, uh--I totally
got to second base without
even touching first.

493
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,265
You know what I mean?

494
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:02,400
Don't worry
about it, Tommy.

495
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,835
Some people
just don't know how
to play fair, ok?

496
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:06,570
All right,
you be a good sport.

497
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:09,072
You go over there
and shake Jessica's
hand, ok?

498
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,041
For what it's worth,
Gary, um,

499
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,509
I'm proud of you.

500
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,677
Proud of me
for what?

501
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,878
No matter what
I did, I couldn't
help Tommy.

502
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:17,912
Look, you know what?
You did.

503
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:20,314
You let him know
that it's ok for a man

504
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:23,283
To swallow his pride
when someone else's
feelings are on the line.

505
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,251
I mean,
that's a much bigger deal

506
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:27,787
Than getting
on any team, Gary.
Besides, look.

507
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,889
He doesn't look like
he's suffering too much.

508
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,223
Hey, uh, dad,
Jessica just told me

509
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:33,191
About this ballroom dancing
class she takes after school,

510
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:34,959
And she wants me
to be her partner.

511
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,794
Oh, instead
of wrestling?

512
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:39,062
Yeah. Well, I mean,
ballroom dancing with Jessica

513
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:43,131
Sounds like a lot more fun
than holding some sweaty guy
between my thighs.

514
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:46,067
Yeah. Tell me about it.

515
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:53,208
Another Brooks
gets pinned.

516
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:55,811
The dynasty
of failure continues.

517
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:57,812
Heh heh. Ok, soup.
That's terrific.

518
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:00,148
Look, Tommy, if it's
all right with you

519
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,016
And if your mom
doesn't think

520
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,484
I'm setting
a bad example,

521
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:05,185
I think
I'd like to really

522
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,354
Kick soup Campbell's
ass on this mat
once and for all.

523
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,922
I'm good.
Go for it.

524
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:12,057
Let's go, soup.
You and me
right now.

525
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:13,391
I'm havin' soup
for dinner.

526
00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:16,293
Dad, can we
have soup for dinner?

527
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,529
Shut up, donny.

528
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:22,632
All right, I got
30 seconds to spare.

529
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,133
You on top
or me on top?

530
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,268
I'll start on bottom.
All right.

531
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,236
I figure you could use
all the help you can get.

532
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,771
Do us a favor, allison.

533
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:29,905
Count us in.

534
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,506
Uh, 1, 2, 3.
Wrestle.

535
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:32,507
Ohh! Ow!

536
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,476
I think you broke my ribs!

537
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,343
Oh, really?
No, not really.

538
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:42,549
Yes. Ha!

539
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,516
How's that feel, soup?

540
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,051
Not so good. I think
I fell on my keys.

541
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,519
Gah! You ready to give up?

542
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,486
Are you kidding me?

543
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,722
I got you right
where I want you.

544
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,590
I think you sat
in some gum.

545
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,492
That's not my ass, soup.
That's yours.

546
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:02,272
You think
I'm letting go,
you're high.

547
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,240
I will die on this mat.

548
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:06,509
You will be pinning
my corpse.

549
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,576
[cell phone rings]

550
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:09,178
Ah, that's my phone.
Do you mind?

551
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,213
Nah, I don't mind.
Wh-where is it? Right here?

552
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:13,048
Wait. No funny business.
Ok.

553
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,585
Joe Campbell's phone.

554
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,586
Oh, hi, Robin.

555
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:22,055
[whispering]
it's your wife.

556
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:24,090
[whispering]
tell her I'm not here.

557
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,358
Ok.

558
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,660
Uh, Robin, Joe stepped out
for a minute.

559
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,962
It's Gary Brooks.

560
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,429
I'm good. Thanks.

561
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,965
Uh, can I take
a message, though?

562
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,866
Pick up, uh,
skim milk and eggs

563
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,602
And remind him to take
his lipitor. You got it.

564
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:39,569
Bye, Robin.

565
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,504
Don't forget
to take your Lipitor.

566
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:42,471
Cholesterol?

567
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:44,340
Yeah. Ah, they think
it's genetic,

568
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,908
But what
do they know?

569
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:46,875
Doctors, right?

570
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:49,577
Yeah. Uh,
they're closin' up.

571
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:51,079
How long have we been here?

572
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,380
I don't know.

573
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,581
I'm starvin'. You wanna
order a pizza or something?

574
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:55,816
Aw, I can't.
The cheese.

575
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:56,783
Oh, right. Sorry.

576
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:57,951
Don't let it
stop you, though.

577
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,986
If you get me
a salad,
I'll be fine.

578
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:03,122
Salad? I'd rather
have the pizza.

579
