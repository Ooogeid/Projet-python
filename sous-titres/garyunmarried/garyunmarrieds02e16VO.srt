1
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,943
[both screaming]

2
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,856
[laughing]

3
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:42,121
[laughing]

4
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:43,365
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

5
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:45,017
Yes!
Yeah!

6
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:47,035
My brother!
How long are you home for?

7
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:48,311
Well, let's see,
the rest of my life.

8
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:49,653
My time in the marines
is up, man.

9
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:50,728
I'm a civilian now.

10
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,011
Whoo!
Ha ha.

11
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:53,352
My man. Let's play
some video games.

12
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,468
Want to play, what,
"Gears of War."

13
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,050
My--

14
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:59,898
What, too soon?
Yeah, a little bit.

15
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,778
All right, we'll play
"Mario Kart" or something.

16
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,191
Work our way up,
have a seat.

17
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:04,265
Nice.

18
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,906
I'm gonna get
a whole bunch of beer

19
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:08,724
And some adult diapers,
that way we don't have
to get up for a while.

20
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,287
Hey, so what
are you going to do
now what you're home?

21
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:14,760
I don't know.

22
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,105
Uh, economy's kinda
bad right now.

23
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,116
Kinda thought I'd be
painting with you,

24
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:21,093
But now you're this
big radio guy, so.

25
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,570
I don't know,
you got any ideas?

26
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:23,709
You can do whatever you want,

27
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,948
You know,
you got lots of talent.

28
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:26,824
The world's your oyster,
what do you want to do?

29
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,467
Hey, what if I was on
the radio with you?

30
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:29,906
You know, like a sidekick.

31
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,815
Yeah, nice try,
though, Mitch.

32
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:33,657
You have no radio
experience at all.

33
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,537
I did a ton of radio work
in Afghanistan.

34
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:40,150
You were calling in
air strikes.

35
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:42,529
Come on, man,
we're really funny together.

36
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,172
Any time we play Xbox,
we always get some
good banter going.

37
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,412
No, that's not banter.

38
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:48,217
It's you yelling at me,
calling me a woman,

39
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:49,658
Telling me you're gonna
go in the kitchen,

40
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,632
Make me midol
sandwiches.

41
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,040
[laughs] see?
That funny!

42
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,781
Actually, that is
pretty funny.
Yeah!

43
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,889
All right, look,
I'll talk to Sasha first thing,

44
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,029
But I can't promise anything,
all right?

45
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,336
Hey, I really
appreciate it, bro.

46
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:03,443
What do you say to a quick game
of midnight "Madden"?

47
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:04,680
"Madden"?
Yeah.

48
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,387
Been a while.
Let me switch teams, though, ok?

49
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:09,094
Well, the way you play,
I assumed you already had.

50
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:14,095

52
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,318
All right, thanks
for coming in,

53
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,619
I'll let you know,
Jagger.

54
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,087
You might hire
an assistant named Jagger?

55
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:26,588
That is awesome!

56
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,857
There's a guy in ad sales
named Keith.

57
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:31,658
We'll have half the band.

58
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,659
Well, I am not
hiring Jagger,

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,193
Because under
special skills,

60
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:37,128
He listed
"keepin' it real."

61
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:41,097
[chuckles] well, hey,
speaking of hiring people,

62
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:42,965
You know, my brother Mitch
just got back from the war.

63
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,533
He was over in Afghanistan.

64
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:46,668
And, well, I kinda told him
I would talk to you--

65
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,003
Oh, hang on a second,
Gary, that's my phone.

66
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,371
Which I still have
to answer myself.

67
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:52,674
Though I'm running
out of fake voices.

68
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:54,108
[Australian accent]
g'day, mate,

69
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,710
Sasha Warden's
office.

70
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,912
Hold on, please.

71
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,848
[normal voice]
just come talk to me
in a minute, ok?

72
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,581
Ok.

73
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,749
Hey, Gary,
guess what, man?

74
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,484
Ok, I'll give you a hint,
I'll give you a hint.

75
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:09,287
What are three words
you swore you would
never say again?

76
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,522
"I'm getting married."

77
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,325
I'm getting married!

78
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,460
Oh.

79
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,028
Congratulations,
I guess.

80
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,329
What, uh,

81
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,830
What, the
is the charm?

82
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,098
Yeah, oh, man,
Charlene and I,

83
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,899
We went out
and had a real nice
romantic weekend

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,334
up in Big Bear.

85
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,035
I'm talking long walks,

86
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:29,269
Red wine,

87
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,972
Hot tub. It was like
a two-day cialis commercial.

88
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,509
She laid the law down,
didn't she?

89
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,010
Pretty much. Yeah.

90
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,945
Yeah, we've been
seeing each other
for about six years, man.

91
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,379
If I didn't propose
this weekend,

92
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,647
They'd have been
pulling my body
out of that hot tub

93
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:45,316
And checking
my fingernails for dna.

94
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:48,419
Hey, Gary,
hey, Curtis.
Oh, great.

95
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,686
You know, I was just
about to tell you

96
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,454
All the reasons
you shouldn't get married,

97
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:54,390
And they just walked in
right behind me.

98
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,392
It just so happens
Curtis asked me

99
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:57,826
To help plan
his wedding.

100
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,661
Yeah, we wanted an elegant,
classy wedding,

101
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:00,929
And Charlene says
that Alison is

102
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,330
The classiest woman
she knows.

103
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:04,899
Also, I need Alison
to curb my baby's spending.

104
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,700
You know, I have
a hard time saying no.

105
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,703
Huh, well, Alison
has no problem
saying, "no," at all.

106
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:11,371
She likes to say, "no."

107
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:13,472
She also likes to say,
"over my dead body."

108
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,707
That's a big one.

109
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,608
With her,
if she does say yes,

110
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:19,711
You'll feel like
you're on top
of a dead body.

111
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,546
In which case,
I was the only
stiff in the room.

112
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:23,914
Mmm!
Yeah.

113
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,048
Well.

114
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,082
Is Charlene here?

115
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,183
We have to go
look for dresses.

116
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,785
Yeah, we were in the booth
listening to bands.

117
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:29,952
Hey, Charlene?

118
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,520
Baby, I almost forgot.

119
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,221
We're going to need
to go through this guest list

120
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:34,856
To find out
who's afraid of peacocks,

121
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,924
'cause they gonna want
to sit away from the aisle.

122
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,359
Oh, that's good.
She's smart.

123
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,093
Hey, Charlene!
Hey!

124
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,595
Congratulations!
Thank you!

125
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:43,129
Oh, my gosh.

126
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,965
You just snared yourself
one of the world's most
eligible bachelors.

127
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:48,401
I just got a 40-year-old guy
who's been married twice

128
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:51,271
And sleeps on a futon.

129
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:55,573
But I'm gonna fix all that.

130
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:57,874
Ha, all right!

131
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,542
Charlene,
don't worry,

132
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:00,843
You're going to have
a great wedding.

133
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:02,310
It's gonna be tasteful,
sophisticated.

134
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,512
Oh, no, I'm not worried,
'cause I got ideas.

135
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,813
Bam.

136
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:07,047
Oh.

137
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,248
Uh, wow.

138
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:09,750
I don't think this
is the kind of thing

139
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:14,922
Peaches and Herb would get
together for, yeah.

140
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,790
I thought u guys
talked about

141
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,024
Staying within
a certain budget?

142
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,559
Budget, ok,
I'll tell you
the budget.

143
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,396
Charlene's wedding
is so beautiful
that people cry.

144
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:25,197
That's the budget.

145
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:29,667
Uh, I think the caterer's
looking for something
more like a dollar figure.

146
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,569
Curtis?

147
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,975
You know, you can't
put a number on love.

148
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:41,309
So...

149
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,212
So we started talking
about what Mitch
wanted to do, and--

150
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:49,115
Oh, hang on
a second, Gary.

151
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:52,952
Yeah, she not here
right now, man,
she call you back.

152
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,225
Look, I was thinking
maybe Mitch could be
a sidekick on my show.

153
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,394
[normal voice]
oh, listen, Gary,

154
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,228
I would love
to add more comedy
to the show,

155
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,030
But financially,
I don't see how
that's going to work.

156
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,264
What? Whoa, whoa?

157
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,631
Add more comedy?

158
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:09,332
Yeah, you don't
tell a guy like me
to add more comedy.

159
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,500
You didn't think
it was funny today

160
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,768
When I did
Joe Pesci talking
about the Lakers?

161
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,269
I thought you were
doing urkel.

162
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,671
What?! No.
It was Joe Pesci.

163
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:18,072
Like--[imitating Joe Pesci]
what do you mean?

164
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,640
Kobe Bryant's like a joke,
what, does he amuse you?

165
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,042
He's some kind of clown?
He's a clown?

166
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:23,844
I'm hearing urkel.

167
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:24,945
[normal voice] what?

168
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,813
Look, Mitch will
work for free

169
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:28,415
Until he proves himself.

170
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,749
Here's the thing--
a long time ago,

171
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,884
He made a really big
sacrifice for me.

172
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:34,020
I owe him. Please.

173
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,288
Ok, ok, you can
try him out.

174
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,957
But if it doesn't
work, you're gonna
have to fire him.

175
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,325
You ready
to face that?

176
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:41,859
Yeah, great.
I don't care.

177
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,661
Thanks.

178
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,763
How do you not know
"Goodfellas"?

179
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,199
I was nine
when it came out.

180
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,602
Look, do you know
anything from
"The Goonies"?

181
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,205
"Aladdin"?

182
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,841
"3 Ninjas Kick Back"?

183
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,480
All right,
here's a prediction.

184
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,781
Jason Bay
of the Mets

185
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,481
is going to hit
45 diamond ringers this year.

186
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,182
I know he had a rough stretch--
whoa, whoa, whoa.

187
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,017
Did you just say
"diamond ringers"?

188
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:13,019
Yeah. Yeah,
it's my new thing
for a home run.

189
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,054
"Jason Bay with another
diamond ringer."

190
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:16,388
That doesn't sound like
a home run to me.

191
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,457
How about something like,
"johnny's dough boy."

192
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,891
What?
Yeah.

193
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:21,993
Ooh, ooh, how about
this, how about,

194
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:24,962
"Manny Ramirez
just dropped
a hot bag of nasty

195
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:27,464
Into the bleachers."

196
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,433
You really--you think
that sounds better?

197
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:30,867
All right,
hold that thought, Mitch.

198
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:31,868
We got a call.

199
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,103
Who's this?
Jerry from Glendale.

200
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,305
Jerry from Glendale,
you're on the air, go ahead.

201
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,439
Jerry:
You're an idiot, Brooks.

202
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,607
Jason Bay
is the luckiest guy
in baseball.

203
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:41,709
If he hits three
home runs this year,

204
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,177
I'll pay your salary.

205
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,879
Which can't be much,
because you suck.

206
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,715
Ha ha, ok, Jerry.

207
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:50,850
Hey, Jerry,
this is Mitch.

208
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:52,752
Never talk
to my brother
that way again.

209
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:54,086
You understand?

210
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:55,421
We got
your phone number.

211
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:56,922
I'm going to reverse
white page you,

212
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,823
Come to your house
and show you

213
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:02,026
How I can tie
your shoe from
inside your mouth!

214
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,261
Hey, uh, Mitch,

215
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:05,596
It's ok to have attitude,

216
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:07,431
But you gotta, like,
pull it back a little bit.

217
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:09,233
Just a little,
just dial it back.

218
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,534
All right, roger that,
loud and clear.

219
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:12,102
Just like firing
a semi-auto.

220
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,637
All right. Here we go.
Let's take another call.

221
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:15,838
We have Nate in Venice.

222
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,706
Nate, you're on the air,
what's up?

223
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:19,074
Nate: I don't know.
Diamond ringers

224
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,109
Sounds a little soft, bro.

225
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,178
Hey, Gary's not
your bro, Nate.

226
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,547
Gary, who is this dude?
Whoa, whoa!

227
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,983
I'll tell you who I am,
I'm your nightmare,
captain,

228
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:28,616
That's who I am.
I'm the man who
steals your mom

229
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:31,584
From your dad
and ruins his life.

230
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:32,852
Then I get your mom
to marry me,

231
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:35,187
And I dump her
at the altar!

232
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:38,790
Then I go back
and marry your dad!

233
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,458
Huh?

234
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,626
How's that
for soft, Nate?

235
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,027
[dial tone]

236
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:44,995
Let's take a little break.

237
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,029
This is "The Score"
with Gary Brooks.

238
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,197
And machine gun Mitch!

239
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,832
Ha ha, this is fun.

240
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,534
Yeah, a real riot.

241
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,704
[chuckles]

242
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,739
I thought that went--
fire him.

243
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,006
Ok.

244
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:59,573
Hey.

245
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:02,376
Hey. Uh, Mitch, buddy,
we gotta talk.

246
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,943
Things are going
great, right?

247
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,044
Yeah, it's definitely
going great.

248
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,245
I just think maybe
your talents

249
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,380
Are being misused in here,
you know?

250
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,216
What's going on?
You gonna fire me?

251
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,317
Well--
oh, my god.

252
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,152
You're gonna fire
your brother.

253
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,053
[chuckles] no.

254
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:19,155
No, Mitch.

255
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:21,090
It's just, uh...

256
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,960
I'm promoting you.

257
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:29,498
You are now Sasha Warden's
assistant. Congratulations.

258
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:30,832
Really?
Yep.

259
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,234
I don't know.

260
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:33,935
I don't know,
seems like kind of
a lower position.

261
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:36,438
No, it's not.
It's corporate, man.

262
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:37,472
I gotta be honest
with you, Mitch.

263
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:38,707
Anybody could do this
on-air stuff.

264
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,008
You sit down,
you talk, it's easy.

265
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,509
But you know what
I saw in here today?

266
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,145
A businessman.
A businessman?

267
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,947
Like Donald Trump.

268
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:47,214
The donald.

269
00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:48,515
Yeah.
Yeah!

270
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:49,649
Now you think about it.

271
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,085
You got the perfect mind
for business, Mitch.

272
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:53,386
You're logical,
you're mathematical,

273
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,487
You're ruthless.

274
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,989
I mean, you're gonna
start as an assistant.

275
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,090
But I give you six months,

276
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,758
You're gonna be
running this place!

277
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,860
And Sasha signed off
on this?

278
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,196
Are you kidding me?
It was practically her idea.

279
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,831
This is great.
Thanks, man,

280
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,333
I appreciate it.
Ok!

281
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:08,734
Ha ha!
Yeah!

282
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,501
Oh, look. Oh.

283
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:13,170
Hey! Yeah!

284
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:14,772
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

285
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:21,679
You want Mitch
to be my assistant?

286
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,047
After what he did
on the radio?

287
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,482
Absolutely not.

288
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:26,016
All right, so he's not
an on-air type of guy.

289
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:28,352
That doesn't mean
he's not qualified
to be an assistant.

290
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,586
He told a little boy

291
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,255
He was going
to drop-kick him
into traffic.

292
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:34,991
All right, look,
here's the thing.

293
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:37,660
Mitch and I,
we look out
for each other.

294
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:39,161
I really let him down.

295
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:40,628
When we were in
our twenties,

296
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,930
We were both supposed
to go into the Marines
together, ok?

297
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:45,532
I was literally
in the recruiter's office

298
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,500
When I got the call
that Alison was pregnant,

299
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,035
And I bailed.

300
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:50,836
So now you feel like
you owe him?

301
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,538
I totally feel like
I owe the guy, ok?

302
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:54,072
Please, help me on this one.

303
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:55,873
I'm asking you,
as your boyfriend.

304
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:57,375
That is not fair.
We said we were going

305
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:59,276
To keep our relationship
and work separate.

306
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:01,510
Yeah, that was before
I really needed something.

307
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:02,945
[telephone rings]

308
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,847
Besides, how many more accents
do you have left in you?

309
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:06,315
Actually,
I have one more,

310
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,683
But I'm pretty sure
it's offensive.

311
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:11,385
Sasha Warden's office.

312
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:12,986
Oh, hi, Mrs. Wong.

313
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:16,522
Oh, that was close!

314
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:19,191
Tell him he can
start tomorrow.
Ok.

315
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:24,129
Look, Charlene,
you can't come down
the aisle on a zebra!

316
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,529
I mean, like,

317
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,431
Where would you even
get one of those?

318
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:29,666
I mean, at the zoo,
they don't have
a "need a zebra,

319
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,503
Take a zebra" tray
out front.

320
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:35,240
I am the bride!

321
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:37,208
And the bride gets
what she wants.

322
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,376
So I don't want
to hear anymore

323
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:39,810
"can'ts" or "too bigs",

324
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:43,847
And stop telling me
Marvin Gaye died in 1984!

325
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:45,148
Ooh.

326
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,750
Look, I don't
want to say this
in front of her,

327
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:48,917
But I'm on
your side.

328
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,519
No, you have to say it
in front of her,

329
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,553
Curtis, ok?
You cannot have

330
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,055
Zebras in your wedding,

331
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,457
Or a snow machine,
or acrobats.

332
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,392
And even if I could get
an ice sculpture that big,

333
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:02,896
I don't think david blaine
is going to want to sit
in it for three days!

334
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:04,463
I know she can be
a little overbearing,

335
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:07,299
But she's nervous,
and this is how she
expresses anxiety.

336
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,167
Trust me, she really is
an incredible woman.

337
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,268
Ok, look, look,
I love Charlene, ok?

338
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,868
But she's acting
like a nutcase!

339
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:14,469
I'm sorry, you know what,
I shouldn't have said that

340
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,437
About your future bride, ok.

341
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,272
I just--I don't want
to see you get, you know,

342
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,207
Walked all over
for the rest of your life.

343
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,275
Oh, please,
like you didn't boss

344
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:23,879
Gary around
for 15 years?

345
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:27,348
Actually, it was 19
if you include high school.

346
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:30,451
Ok, look, this is
our relationship!

347
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:32,553
She makes every decision.

348
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:34,188
And I say
the word "baby" a lot.

349
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,256
All right?

350
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:38,024
It works for us, ok?
Well...

351
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,158
Now just tell me,

352
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,227
Is there anything
on our list
I can afford?

353
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,161
Uh, well, let's see.

354
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,929
Do you feel
comfortable waxing

355
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,698
The bridesmaid's
privates into
the shape of hearts?

356
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,269
Um, considering
the three of them
are my sisters, no.

357
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,104
Ugh!

358
00:12:57,973 --> 00:13:00,141
[telephone rings]

359
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,343
Sasha Warden's
office.

360
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:06,046
Uh, she is on
a call right now,

361
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:07,747
Can I take
a message?

362
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:11,184
All right,
anniversary
of uncle's death.

363
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:14,253
Place flowers
at gravesite.

364
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,921
Got it.

365
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:17,756
Hey, tgif.

366
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,891
All right!

367
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,426
Look at you, man!
Look at me!

368
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,027
Climbing the ladder.

369
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,528
See you at the top, M.B.

370
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,229
Not if I see
you first, J.B.

371
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,831
[both chuckle]
excuse me.

372
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:29,799
Ah, god!
Aah!

373
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,701
I'm here to see
Gary Brooks.

374
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,969
Mitch, that's Joe Torre,
manager of the Dodgers!

375
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,971
Let him up!

376
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,040
Sorry, Mr. Torre.
I'm Gary Brooks.

377
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,575
That's my maniac brother Mitch.

378
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:43,810
Sorry, Mr. Torre.

379
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,578
Shouldn't sneak up
behind me, though.

380
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,313
Military kind of
trained me to kill
people who do that.

381
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:51,316
Well, thanks...
Thanks for your
military service,

382
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:52,450
Really appreciate it.

383
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,152
Hey, I know we got off
to an awkward start,

384
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:56,019
But you think
there's any way we can
get an autograph?

385
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,086
Oh, sure.
Ahh!

386
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,854
Aah!
Mitch, Mitch!

387
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:02,023
I was just going
for my pen.

388
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:07,530
Uh, Mr. Torre,
I'm sorry,

389
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,831
Would you excuse me
for a second

390
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,032
While I talk
to my brother?

391
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,833
Sure.
Ok, we'll be right with you.

392
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,202
Mitch, can I talk to you
for a second here?

393
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:17,070
Sure, Gar. Hey, just
give me one second

394
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:19,006
To get someone
to cover my desk.

395
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,209
Torre, cover my desk.

396
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,848
Mitch, this is not
working out, ok?

397
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,316
Sorry.

398
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,617
I'm getting fired?
Yes.

399
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,452
You said I was
cut out for business!

400
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:34,553
I only told you
that 'cause

401
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,554
You're so terrible
on the radio.

402
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:38,222
Oh, no, no, you said
I nailed it on the radio.

403
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:39,890
What's going on, Gary?

404
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:40,858
Mitch, I gotta
let you go.

405
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,126
You just put
Joe Torre
in a headlock.

406
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,860
You kinda freak
everybody out.

407
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:45,762
So this is where
you bail on me, huh?

408
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:47,797
Just like when
we joined the Marines.

409
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:50,099
I didn't bail, Mitch.
I had a responsibility.

410
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,035
Well, if it looks like a bail
and smells like a bail...

411
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,470
That doesn't...
All right, look,

412
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:57,538
It doesn't matter,
Mitch, ok?

413
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:59,307
I'm done
helping you.

414
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:02,443
You never started
helping me, all right?

415
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,744
Doing nothing
would have been better

416
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:06,479
Than setting me up
to fail, twice.

417
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,780
Look, I'm home
from the service

418
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,615
And I just need
a little support.

419
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,483
And you let me down, bro.

420
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:18,356
Now I know how Rambo felt.

421
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:31,833
Hey.

422
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,501
Nice grouping.

423
00:15:33,502 --> 00:15:34,735
Yeah, it's amazing,

424
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:37,237
You put them all
through the same
hole like that.

425
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,573
Believe it or not,

426
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:41,608
There are some things
I actually do pretty good.

427
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,142
I can see.

428
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,711
What do you want, Gary?

429
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,980
Is that
a .357 magnum?

430
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,682
Yeah, it is.

431
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,751
Just, uh,
just checking, ok.

432
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,854
What I've been holding
around for 16 years,
it has to stop, ok?

433
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,122
You and I were
supposed to go into
the Marines together,

434
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,524
But we didn't.
You know why
I didn't, Mitch?

435
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,359
Because I had a family
that was about to happen.

436
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
Alison was pregnant,
I had to care for my wife

437
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:07,996
And my unborn child.
I had to be a grown-up.

438
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:09,998
And I suggest
you start acting like
a grown-up, too, Mitch.

439
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,533
And as far as what
you want to do for
the rest of your life,

440
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:13,968
You've got to figure
that out for yourself.

441
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:16,570
[gunshot]
if that's ok with you.

442
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:20,707
You know what, Gary?

443
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,242
What, is this the part
where you kill me? Heh.

444
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:24,510
You're absolutely right.

445
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,478
This is the part
where you kill me?!
No.

446
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:29,647
No, no. I mean,
you tried to help me out,
you did everything you could,

447
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,215
And I just screwed it up.

448
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,950
And I wanted to blame you,
because...

449
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,787
Well, because.

450
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,588
'cause I'm scared, Gary!

451
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,890
I'm so scared!
[sobbing]

452
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:43,258
Whoa!

453
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,293
I'm scared,
too, Mitch!

454
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:48,195
Mitch, get it away!

455
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:50,497
When I was in the Marines,
you know, I knew who I was,

456
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:54,734
But now, I don't even know!

457
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:58,637
That's why I was so happy
to see you when I came out!

458
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:00,505
You know?

459
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:01,906
[sobbing]

460
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:04,042
Yeah.

461
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:05,710
Yeah, you were
happy 'cause

462
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:07,178
We could sit
on the couch,
watch football,

463
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,112
Drink beer
like guys, right?

464
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,480
No, no, no!

465
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:12,248
'cause I figured
you'd be able

466
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,916
To help me
figure out who I am,

467
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,318
But that's not fair!

468
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,353
I mean, I have
to do that! Me!

469
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:21,289
Not you! Me!

470
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,859
I gotta do it,
and you, you told me
what I needed to hear!

471
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,628
And that's why I love you
so much, Gary!

472
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,630
[sobbing]

473
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,448
Thanks, guys.

474
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,916
Charlene's going
to be here any second
for the food tasting.

475
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,884
Hey, uh, what's
this black stuff
called again?

476
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,253
It's called rhythm
and blues, tom, ok?

477
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,555
It's for the party
afterwards,

478
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:51,059
And we don't
call it "black stuff"
in this house!

479
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,695
I was talking about this.
[chuckles]

480
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:55,897
That's caviar.

481
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:57,264
Oh.

482
00:17:57,265 --> 00:18:00,267
Hey, kids, go get
your stuff, ok?

483
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:01,568
Ok.

484
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,202
Hey, Gary, I heard
you talked to Mitch.

485
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:04,570
Good for you.

486
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,639
Look, Charlene and Curtis
are going to come over

487
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,608
Any sec to taste some food,
if you want to hang out.

488
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:10,775
What's going on
around here?

489
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:11,976
You seem super calm.

490
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:13,478
I thought you said
Charlene was
making you nuts,

491
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,112
Curtis wouldn't
stand up to her.

492
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:16,947
Well, that was before
I discovered my secret weapon

493
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:19,250
That solved both problems.

494
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,685
Alison, you cannot
drink all day, ok?

495
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:24,087
That is not
my secret weapon.

496
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,322
And, yes, I can.

497
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:30,760
Alison, I'm going
to make this thing
easier on everybody.

498
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,095
All this picking
and choosing,

499
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:33,127
It's just too much,

500
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,794
And it's driving
everybody crazy.

501
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:37,363
Right,
so I have decided

502
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:40,499
To have it all!

503
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,934
I want a little bit
of everything!

504
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,602
I want people
to go home and say,

505
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,871
"damn! I never had
pheasant or caviar!

506
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:50,107
Tonight I had both!"

507
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:53,076
Ok, time for
the secret weapon.

508
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:56,112
Ahem. Mitch.

509
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,213
Curtis, Gary.

510
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:02,116
And this stunning beauty
must be Charlene.

511
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,418
I've heard so much
about you.

512
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,955
Ooh! I like
this one! So you--

513
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:10,590
Lock it down, squeaky toy!

514
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,159
I'm running the show
from here on out.

515
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,994
You can talk
when I'm finished.

516
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:17,429
Now, we've got
budget considerations.

517
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,131
There will be no arrival
on white horses.

518
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,933
There will be
no harp orchestra.

519
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:24,235
However, this black stuff
is acceptable.

520
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:26,670
As is the Marvin Gaye
impersonator,

521
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:28,505
Who will be singing
such hits as

522
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,073
"heard it through
the grapevine,"

523
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:32,074
"what's goin' on,"
and of course,
"sexual healing."

524
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:33,575
Is that clear?

525
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:36,644
Yes, sir.
Good, moving on.

526
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,678
Curtis?
Yeah.

527
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,946
It's time
to stone up, man.

528
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:40,647
You are a man?
Mm-hmm.

529
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,315
You have two testicles.
Yeah.

530
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:45,184
I suggest
you deploy them.

531
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,788
Um, all right.

532
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,955
Um, ahem.

533
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,190
[deep voice]
um, Charlene...

534
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,592
We want the wedding
to be nice,

535
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:57,160
But we did
set a budget.

536
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,663
Now there is an assortment
of bridal bouquets,

537
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,432
Corsages, and nose gaze
in the living room.

538
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,000
I suggest that we
go in there,

539
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:05,868
Take a look at them,
and pick something

540
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,336
Within our price range,

541
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:10,105
But that is still
as beautiful as you are.

542
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:14,675
Oh, baby!

543
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,744
Move, move, move!

544
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:19,713
Thank you.

545
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,149
Hey, I owe you
a big thank you, man.

546
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,685
Got my ass in gear,
and I think I figured out

547
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,753
Exactly what I want to do
with the rest of my life.

548
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,054
A wedding planner?

549
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:31,188
No. No.

550
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,790
I mean, I'm good
at it, but...

551
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,191
I need to be doing something
that makes a difference,

552
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,926
You know,
where people's lives
are on the line.

553
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,797
I want to be a Marine.

554
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,398
Mitch, come on,
you don't have
to say that

555
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:44,700
Just 'cause you can't
think of something
else, you know?

556
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,835
I'm not just saying it,
Gary, all right?

557
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,470
I love the Marines.
I'm good at it.

558
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:50,705
It's where I'm happiest.

559
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,473
So after Curtis' wedding,

560
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,241
I'm going back in.

561
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:56,009
I'm gonna
miss you, buddy.

562
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,144
And I know

563
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:58,879
I'm your older brother,

564
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,715
But I want to be you
when I grow up.

565
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,020
[whispering]

566
