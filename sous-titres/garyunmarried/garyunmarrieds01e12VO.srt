1
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,429
I can't believe nobody's
thought of this.

2
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:20,534
What's, what's all that, son?

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,648
I had clear some space out of my locker
because Danielle is moving in with me.

4
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:26,345
The girlfriend's moving in?

5
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:30,284
OK, but, why buy the locker when
you're getting the combination for free?

6
00:00:32,163 --> 00:00:34,822
She was always over there anyway,
and we were spending a lot of time

7
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:38,005
going back and forth between hers and
mine, so, you know, it just makes sense.

8
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,188
I'm proud of you, son. You know what?
I'm gonna take you to the Go-cart ranch

9
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:42,812
for one last hurrah.

10
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,500
How'd your old lockermate Kenny take it?

11
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,457
Not so good, but it's made
him take a look at his own life.

12
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:54,557
You know what? I think he's finally
gonna take that hall monitor job.

13
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,700
Oh, my gosh! Louise, that is awesome!

14
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:03,526
Yeah, she's got a few more finishing
touches before the open house tonight.

15
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,690
What are you talking about? It
already looks exactly like tracy Morgan.

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,013
It's Maya Angelou.

17
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,294
She's a poet and one of the most
amazing women of the 20th Century.

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,480
I don't want to disagree with you,
sweetheart, but I was reading "swimsuit"

19
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:20,729
magazine. They listed the 50 most
amazing women she wasn't mentioned.

20
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,879
It might not be the best time for that
kind of teasing. Louise had a tough day.

21
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,572
Sweetheart, what happened? Why'd
you have a tough day? What happened?

22
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,887
Miss St. James happened.

23
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:37,257
Miss St. James is a temporary teacher's
assistant in Louise's art class,

24
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:41,009
and apparently she's been drawing
a lot of attention from the boys.

25
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,394
Why?
She has arthritis?

26
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:46,079
She's a juggler?

27
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:49,930
She has enormous beach balls.
Got it, got it.

28
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,276
Good.

29
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:54,903
It's like every guy's IQ. Drops
50 points when she walks in a room.

30
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:58,464
When do guys stop acting so stupid, mom?

31
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,859
When they close the lid on the coffin.

32
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,675
Look, Louise, not all men are shallow
and just into looks. I mean look at me.

33
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:09,985
I married your mom. I didn't know if
she was gonna grow into that forehead.

34
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:15,306
My forehead? When you wear a Halloween
mask, his Lazy eye corrects itself.

35
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,450
Even my best friend Scotty,
who is smarter than me

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,785
can't take his eyes off of her.
When she walks n the room,

37
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,840
his Lazy eye corrects itself.

38
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:33,127
All right. Hey.
How hot is this teacher?

39
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,898
That's right. Were you not just
sitting here when you told your daughter

40
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,032
that all men are
not obsessed with looks?

41
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,859
How hot is this teacher?

42
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,497
Unbelievably hot.
It's like looking at the fricking sun.

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,489
You just.

44
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:50,494
You have to behave yourself tonight, OK?
'cause Louise is gonna be watching you.

45
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,371
- Of course, yeah.
- And, Gary.

46
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:55,459
Make sure to get all your giggles
out of the way now because Louise's

47
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,331
math teacher is still named
mr. Balzac, OK?

48
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,678

Here. Let me.
Your jacket is caught on the.

52
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,824
- Oh my!
- There.

53
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:32,334
Angelou.
Maya Angelou.

54
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:35,380
- You must be Louise's dad.
- Yeah, how'd you know that?

55
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:39,075
She's only one who chose Maya Angelou
for our great American women project.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,680
We have 5 papier-mache Britneys
and one plaster of Paris Hilton.

57
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,070
I'm Gary Brooks.

58
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,620
Erica St. James.
Louise always talks about you.

59
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,279
Louise has been talking about you, too.

60
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:52,106
She's darling.

61
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,260
She gets that from me.
I'm a quarter darling.

62
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:58,109
And, I'm part Labrador Retriever,
also, so

63
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:01,740
if you have any tennis balls floating
in your swimming pool, I'm your man.

64
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:05,199
Will you bring it back or will
I have to Chase you around the yard?

65
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,296
Who doesn't like to be chased?

66
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:10,698
Why don't you go ahead
and sign in and

67
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,297
grab a pack of the reading materials
for you and your wife?

68
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,220
No, that's my ex-wife, ex.
She got that title from me

69
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:20,603
when I divorced her and got her
completely out of my life, here she is.

70
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:22,331
OK. Excuse me.

71
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:26,237
- Hey, guys.
- I see you met her.

72
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:30,520
I did. I got to tell you, not impressed.

73
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:33,422
Come on, Gary. She's very pretty.

74
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,492
I guess so. I mean, I...
I just don't see it.

75
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:39,591
She's more symmetrical than...
than pretty.

76
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,502
I'm so glad you just said that, dad,
because I can't wait

77
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:45,319
for you to meet Miss Plummer.
She's the real art teacher.

78
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,418
She's smart and well-read, and I
want to be just like her when I grow up.

79
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,418
Yeah! Well, you know what?
I want a smart

80
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,602
and well-read woman
standing in front of me,

81
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,405
and I mean right now, young lady!
Go get Miss Plummer!

82
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,964
Laying it on a little thick, aren't we?

83
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:02,113
What? Just showing
my daughter that I'm not shallow.

84
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,050
But you are shallow, Gary.

85
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,654
You know, that would hurt
my feelings if it wasn't coming

86
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:08,805
from such a mediocre-looking person.

87
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:15,257
- I'm Joan Plummer.
- Hi. I'm Gary Brooks.

88
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,690
Well, we are so happy
to have Louise in class.

89
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:21,382
It's nice to have a young person
so concerned about the environment.

90
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,965
Well, that's our Louise.

91
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,406
She actually switched us
from paper plates

92
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,408
to eco-friendly bamboo.

93
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:30,192
Bamboo. That is amazing.

94
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:34,501
We were going through 200 plates
a week. It just made sense.

95
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,432
Sorry.
I wasn't sure if you were still there.

96
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:44,995
Come on. Gary, we have to go to
the rest of Louise's classes, OK?

97
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:47,502
OK, hey, it's great to meet you,
Miss Plummer, OK?

98
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:49,334
I mean, wants to be you
when she grows up.

99
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:52,434
I've known you 5 seconds;
I want to be you when I grow up.

100
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:55,627
Thank you.
Thanks, and thanks for coming.

101
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,956
And I'll see you at the gym, Allison.
Bye, Louise.

102
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,148
Bye, Miss Plummer.

103
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,139
- Didn't you just love her, dad?
- She was awesome, yeah.

104
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,445
She's so much cooler
than Miss St. James.

105
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,622
Way cooler. That's probably why
she dresses in so many layers and wears,

106
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:09,033
like, granny scarves.

107
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,288
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up, OK?
- All right. Come on, honey.

108
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,699
- Dad, come here. Check out my locker.
- All right.

109
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:24,352
Danielle has really girled
it up in there, hasn't she?

110
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,130
You know, Kenny used to fart
in the locker and shut the door real

111
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:28,970
quick when he saw me coming.

112
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:30,518
This is way better.

113
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,685
Son, I don't see any
of your stuff in this locker. I'm sorry.

114
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,961
- No, look. It's in here. Come on.
- No, that's...

115
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:40,163
- It's right there. Right.
- I don't see it. Got to get in there.

116
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,419
In the back.
In the back.

117
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,687
OK, wait. Those baseball cards?

118
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,340
That's my cave.

119
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:52,342
My gosh. That perfume is murder, Tommy.

120
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:55,398
- I guess I don't notice it anymore.
- Thank you.

121
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,635
All right, so. But...

122
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,426
I'm meeting Danielle at Jim
and Ellen's Locker, so I'll see you.

123
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:12,640
Wait. Did I blow out the candle?
Yeah. I did.

124
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:19,062
Mr. Brooks. I'm glad I caught you. Did
you want a classroom phone directory?

125
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,163
Yes, I would. Thank you.

126
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:23,370
That's my number right there.

127
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:26,059
I have the same area code. You know,
I thought we had a lot in common,

128
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:28,315
but now it's getting kind of scary,
you know?

129
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,263
Well, don't be scared, but do call.

130
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:33,889
Listen, I can't call you.

131
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:36,062
You're my daughter's teacher.
It's not right.

132
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,176
I'm just a temp.
I'm gonna be gone in 3 weeks.

133
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,686
I'll call you tomorrow.

134
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,755
I can't believe I'm actually
calling to ask you out. This is crazy.

135
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,191
You know, i'm a taxpayer, you're a
teacher. You kind of work for me, right?

136
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:55,037
If we're going out on a date,
you should call me Erica.

137
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:58,477
OK, but on the date, can I call you
Miss St. James? It's Kinda hot.

138
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,104
I got to be honest with you.
The open house was great and the...

139
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,089
The art class was
the best part of the whole night.

140
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:08,829
I have to go and I'll
talk to you later. Bye.

141
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,122
Was that Miss Plummer?

142
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:14,287
- Well.
- I knew it! You like her, don't you?

143
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,749
Miss Plummer? Yeah.

144
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:21,507
- 'Course I do. She's great.
- Did you ask her out?

145
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:23,932
Well, I you know, I don't.

146
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,412
That be weird for you wouldn't it?
She's your teacher.

147
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,039
No! I love Miss Plummer.

148
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:31,092
Dad, you're single. You got to get
out there and, you know, mix it up.

149
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:33,094
- I don't. I don't.
- Call her back.

150
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,690
- I don't think she'd go out with me.
- Call her.

151
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,820
- I don't think it's a good.
- Call her!

152
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:40,293
All right.
Let me get her number out of here.

153
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:43,378
No, why don't you just hit redial?
You were just talking to her.

154
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,691
My fingers are kind of fat.
I want to work them out.

155
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:51,602
I got a closet full of gloves.
They don't even fit me anymore.

156
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:00,731
Miss Plummer, it's Gary Brooks again.

157
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,347
Hi, Gary. What do you mean, "again"?

158
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,853
I know.

159
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:11,366
It's probably against
your policy to consider

160
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,885
going out with the parent
of a student, right? So.

161
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,219
- Are you asking me out?
- I'm sorry.

162
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:19,236
I should have known that the school
would frown on that kind of thing.

163
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,348
Actually, we're free to date
whomever we want,

164
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,011
and it just so happens
i'm available on friday.

165
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,363
I'll bet you are.

166
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:33,684
- Available on friday.
- Tell her. Tell her yes.

167
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,733
Yes. Yeah.
We should do something friday,

168
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:40,274
and I'll call you later
and we'll just shore up some plans, OK?

169
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:42,759
- Bye, Miss Plummer.
- Thank you, dad.

170
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,974
You've renewed my faith in men.

171
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,685
What did he do,
wear pants to go get the mail?

172
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,008
Dad's going out with Miss Plummer
this friday night.

173
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,749
Really? You asked out Miss Plummer?

174
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,042
Yeah, I sure did.

175
00:09:57,776 --> 00:09:59,211
I mean, but can you blame me?

176
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:02,725
Who wouldn't want to spend time with
such an attractive... public servant?

177
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:07,694
- What are you going to wear, dad?
- What am I gonna wear?

178
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:10,413
Shouldn't I just, you know,
concentrate on being me?

179
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:12,431
You're right.
I mean, look at me.

180
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,794
Even I get caught up in it sometimes.

181
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:20,361
- What the hell are you doing?
- Setting good example for our daughter.

182
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:23,828
What, are you kidding me?
What, you asked out Louise's teacher?

183
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:26,421
Why? What's the big deal?
There's nothing wrong with that.

184
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,039
You don't ask out your kids'teachers.

185
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:31,779
Everybody knows that. There's
too many things that can go wrong,

186
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,656
and knowing you, they all will.

187
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,366
Well, I never even thought of that.

188
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,600
But it wasn't even my idea.
It was Louise's idea.

189
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,921
So wait a minute.
She made you call Miss Plummer?

190
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,863
Yes, because she heard me
making a date with Miss St. James.

191
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:47,934
I'm sorry.
You asked out Miss St. James, too?

192
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,653
- I was trying to slip that one by her!
- Man! Gary!

193
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,370
Are you out of your mind?

194
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:54,627
What are you trying to sleep
with all of Louise teachers?

195
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,802
Look, I'm gonna sleep
with whoever I have to

196
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:58,869
to prove to my daughter
i'm not shallow, OK?

197
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:02,601
God! Gary.
Look, you've got to cancel that date.

198
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:04,514
I just don't want to hurt her feelings.

199
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,478
I'm sure Miss St. James
will get over it.

200
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,890
You mean Miss Plummer.

201
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,794
No, I mean Miss St. James.

202
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,206
No, Miss Plummer. Miss st.
James is the hot one.

203
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:16,826
I know. You have to
call and cancel the date.

204
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:19,859
I'm totally confused. We have
to start this conversation over again.

205
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:24,626
Fine. I will start. You have to cancel
the date with Miss St. James.

206
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,879
How do you lose me after one sentence?

207
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,797
Miss St. James is the hot one.
Why would I cancel the date with her?

208
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:34,795
Because, Gary, Miss Plummer is Louise's
favorite teacher and you already

209
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,908
asked her out, so you have
to go through with it, but just be clear

210
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,491
that she knows you're just taking
her out as a friend, all right?

211
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,988
Where do you take a friend?

212
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,203
I don't know.
Just someplace that isn't romantic.

213
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,273
Let's think for a second. Let's think
of places that aren't romantic.

214
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:48,446
The mortuary.

215
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,971
Lawyer's office. According to you,
the circus isn't romantic?

216
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:55,796
You know what? That was, like,
the worst valentine's day ever.

217
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,725
Hey, I know.
Miss Plummer belongs to my gym.

218
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,901
Just take her there
and make it like a workout date.

219
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:06,407
Hey, that's a good idea.
And it's a gym, so it's not romantic.

220
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:08,851
She won't get the wrong
idea and there's no booze there,

221
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:11,580
so I won't, you know,
get the wrong idea. Thank you.

222
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:14,602
- Gary, do not mess this up.
- Look, Danielle,

223
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,902
I wish you would have told me you
invited Brian and Tara to our locker.

224
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,820
They're your friends.

225
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:23,856
Are you done?
Are you done?

226
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:29,264
He should have gotten
that locker prenup.

227
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:45,849
Hey, is she here yet?

228
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,835
No, but you are.
What are you doing here?

229
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:49,612
I'm working out with my trainer today.

230
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,522
No, you're here to spy on me,
aren't you?

231
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,960
A little bit of that too, and you better
handle things delicately with Miss P.

232
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:56,684
Don't worry about it. I'm...

233
00:12:58,503 --> 00:12:59,842
It's gonna be quick and easy.

234
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:02,331
Besides, I got to get out of here.
I got another date in 2 hours.

235
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,050
What? You didn't cancel
your date with Miss St. James?

236
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,997
Is that where we landed? 'cause that's
not what I took from our conversation.

237
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,575
- I can't believe you!
- I have to go out with Miss st. James.

238
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,633
- It's my one shot at the bigs.
- Oh, my god!

239
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:15,830
You are so shallow! I mean, the
lengths you will go to to put yourself

240
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:18,033
in the presence of a perfect specimen.

241
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,791
Hello, Diego.

242
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,511
Are you prepared
to work your core today?

243
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:30,757
Lie down on the mats
and start focusing your attention.

244
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,045
Yes, I will.

245
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:39,336
- How you doing?
- If you train with me, you...

246
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:41,699
Could have this.

247
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:47,650
Why, when...
I have this?

248
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:05,621
My gosh, you don't look anything at
all like Miss Plummer, the art teacher.

249
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:09,757
- Was that a compliment?
- A poor one. I'm sorry.

250
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,015
Let me start over.
Miss Plummer, you look fantastic.

251
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,830
Well, that's sweet.
And thanks for asking me out.

252
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,486
Of course. Are you kidding me?

253
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:20,214
I thought we really hit it off in the,
art class,

254
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,734
you know. I hope I didn't come
on too strong in there.

255
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,693
No, you're just
a really effusive person.

256
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:29,244
Yeah. Effus.
When you say effusive, you mean.

257
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,056
I don't know what that means.

258
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:35,215
Ha! Well, maybe i'll give
you a vocabulary lesson later.

259
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,114
Well, maybe after
the vocabulary lesson, we can.

260
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:42,610
You're not. Not really, right?
You're just. It's a suggestive.

261
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:43,899
Yeah, suggestive.

262
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:47,173
Good. 'cause a real
vocabulary lesson boring! All right.

263
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:50,210
All right. Well,
what do you want to do? It's...

264
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:52,729
Fridays,
usually I just like to work neck.

265
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:58,027
Well...
hey, do you want to spar?

266
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,544
I promise I won't hurt you.

267
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:04,048
I don't know. I never hit a girl before,
except for my cousin Gwen,

268
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:06,725
but that's 'cause she dragged
me to a scott baio concert.

269
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:10,616
Well, it'll be fun.
Do you know anything about boxing?

270
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:14,290
I wear boxers.
I got my refrigerator from a box, so...

271
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:18,249
I'm as qualified as anybody else, right?
Let's get going.

272
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,132
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine.

273
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:27,208
OK. All right. All right.

274
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,708
- Wait a minute. You're pretty good.
- Thanks.

275
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,796
I was golden gloves
champion of my weight class.

276
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,980
I didn't know golden gloves
had a division for girls.

277
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,413
Yeah. They don't.

278
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,921
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm just excited, I guess.

279
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,654
- Hey. Excuse me. OK.
- What's up?

280
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,348
- She knows!
- What?

281
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,200
She knows. Louise just called.

282
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,122
She heard Miss St. James on
the answering machine leave a message

283
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,576
canceling the date because
she found out about Miss Plummer.

284
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,667
Wait. Does Miss Plummer know
about my date with Miss St. James?

285
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,581
The whole teachers'lounge knows.

286
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:08,230
Well, then why would Miss Plummer
agree to come here on a date?

287
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,475
Oh boy. All right.
Stay close, OK? All right.

288
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,683
Hey, you know, i, forgot to tell you,

289
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:21,168
before you got here, I did some cardio,
maybe we should just do some stretching.

290
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:23,572
You're stretched kind of thin already,
don't you think?

291
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:28,432
- OK, stop it! Easy. I can explain.
- Explain what?

292
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:31,315
Why you asked out two teachers
from the same classroom?

293
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,024
My gosh. OK.

294
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:37,226
Or why you're taking one out
for a workout

295
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,473
and the other one
to a 5-star restaurant?

296
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:44,127
My gosh. Wait!
Just give me a second, please.

297
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,424
Why don't you take two?
You look like you need it.

298
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,174
Hey, don't get cocky.
I'm sorry!

299
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:54,943
Gary, you're getting killed out there.

300
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:58,178
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know. Just be honest with her.

301
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,696
Come clean, and for god's sakes,
try and throw a punch.

302
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,370
I'm trying to throw a punch,
but she's not where I'm punching.

303
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:06,882
Let's go, Gary. Don't you have another
date you need to get to?

304
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,408
OK, I'm so sorry about this.
OK, Miss Plummer?

305
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,464
All right, look. Hear me out.
I admit, I'm a very shallow person.

306
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,896
I judged you by the way
you looked at work. I admit it.

307
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,317
You can knock me out if it's
gonna make you feel any better,

308
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,650
but when I wake up
and I start chewing solid foods,

309
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,541
i'm gonna ask you out again
because I think you're fantastic.

310
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,342
- That's really sweet.
- Thanks.

311
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,457
Call me.

312
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:41,566
All right. Just wasn't your night,
champ. Come on.

313
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,137
- Here we go.
- I smell biscuits.

314
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,189
I'm so sorry about all this.

315
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:51,400
I honestly thought I was
just more evolved, but the truth is,

316
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:54,090
I guess I'm just attracted to beauty
a lot of people are.

317
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,809
So if that makes me shallow,
then so be it.

318
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:01,096
She really clobbered you, didn't she?

319
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:05,440
I can't hear anything you're saying.
You have to talk more into my good ear.

320
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,138
Did you block any of her punches?

321
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:11,406
Yeah, I was blocking a lot of her
punches until my right eye closed up,

322
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,565
and then I lost my depth perception,

323
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,069
I bet she's feeling some pain today?

324
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,994
Actually, I saw her.
She looked great.

325
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:25,671
Really? There's no marks on her?
Her fist isn't swollen from

326
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,600
me beating it with my face?

327
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:33,456
Thanks for taking me out on a date, dad.
This is Kinda neat.

328
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:36,029
Kinda neat?
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.

329
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:39,110
This is super neat,
and i'm having a great time, OK?

330
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,264
And listen, guys do dumb
things around beautiful girls,

331
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:43,877
and you should get used to it,

332
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,861
because guys are gonna start
doing really dumb things around you.

333
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:49,222
- Dad!
- It's true, sweetheart.

334
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,564
I got to tell you, OK,

335
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,433
- you're beautiful.
- I know.

336
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,407
Scotty's told me,
trying to get on my good side.

337
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:01,271
Yesterday,
his Lazy eye went straight on me.

338
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,410
I could have taken Miss Plummer.

339
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,519
You know me. I can fight.
It's just, she's a defenseless girl.

340
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:11,483
It would have just looked terrible.
Oh, god.

341
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:24,297
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, son. What, what happened?

342
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,908
Danielle threw me out.

343
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:29,846
What do you mean, she threw you out?
That was your locker.

344
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:31,223
No we got in fight then she

345
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:33,838
threw all my stuff out
in the hallway and changed the lock.

346
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:39,322
All because she found my social studies
book in mary Ellen Mazowski's locker.

347
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:43,034
- What was it doing there?
- I don't know.

348
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,911
She just wanted to
look at it before the test.

349
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,888
Doesn't mary Ellen Mazowski.

350
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:51,188
Doesn't she have her
own social studies book?

351
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:55,432
OK. I was over there
the other day after school

352
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:58,126
and I put my book in Mary
Ellen's Locker, all right? Big deal.

353
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,348
If this was Europe,
it wouldn't even be an issue.

354
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,465
Women, they really like to know that

355
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:07,691
they're the only one in your life,

356
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,831
you know? So what are you gonna do?
You gonna move in now with Mary Ellen?

357
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,991
No, I'm gonna crash
at Kenny's for a while.

358
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:17,636
You know, the moment I opened the locker
some fake dog poop fell out on me,

359
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:20,663
and I laughed like I haven't
laughed in a long time.

360
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:24,815
But you know what?
I think I need it.

361
