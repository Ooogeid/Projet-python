1
00:00:02,748 --> 00:00:04,870
I mean, it's just like it's
driving me crazy, Gary.

2
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:07,874
There is something I'm supposed to
tell you. I can't remember what it is.

3
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:11,785
- Who cares? Forget about it, dad.
- No. It's important.

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,785
Why can't I remember anything?

5
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:16,502
Lots of reasons, dad.

6
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:20,093
Ounces and ounces of reasons.

7
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:24,644
- Hey, grandpa.
- Hey, Louise,

8
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:27,154
did I ask you to
remind me of anything?

9
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:32,368
You said if anyone ever asks,
that you were with us at the movies.

10
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:36,339
No, that's not it,
but that still stands.

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:40,515
Hi, dad.
OK, Gary, I hate to break it to you,

12
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:42,780
but it's time to put
your nose to the grindstone.

13
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,087
I thought we agreed. You don't
really like it, and I'm not good at it.

14
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:50,881
No, no, you're not.

15
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:54,532
I'm talking about buckling down
this weekend

16
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:56,406
because Tom is failing history.

17
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,160
- And you want to know why?
- Cos' there is too much of it.

18
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:03,453
Because didn't do his report on Hoover.
This happens every time he is here.

19
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,345
That sounds accusatory.

20
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,592
Then I nailed it,
because I'm accusing you.

21
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:10,152
Look, Gary,
you never make him do his work.

22
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:13,156
Hey, Tommy, how come you didn't
do your report on herbert hoover?

23
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:16,371
'cause it was my weekend with you,
dad, and as a child of divorce,

24
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,492
I try to spend what little time
we have creating memories together.

25
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,168
You did that childhood divorce
speech on me once in the pet store,

26
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,564
and now I'm stuck raising
your stupid pygmy hamster.

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,380
Gary, you have to chip in
and be tougher on Tommy.

28
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:32,632
I'm so tired of having to
be the nag all the time.

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,705
We're all tired of it, Allison.
We're exhausted.

30
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:39,762
Gary, I talked to his teacher,
and he'll let him make up his report,

31
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:43,128
but it has to be in on monday and it
has to be good, or he is going to flunk,

32
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:46,313
and the next thing you know, he's
gonna be painting houses. No offense.

33
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,480
Hello, ma'am. Is your husband home?

34
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,169
I'll tell you what little girl. I take
a box of thin mints and some tagalongs.

35
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:01,765
How you doing?

36
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,770
Look at you guys.
How are you?

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,182
You guys got big.

38
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:09,546
If we were in Afghanistan,
you'd be working in the opium fields,

39
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:12,093
and you'd be getting married.

40
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,474
And you, Allison.

41
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:21,070
As they say over there,
you look, l lovely.

42
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,190
Thank you.

43
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,840
Hey, das is this what you
were trying to remember?

44
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,042
Yeah, your brother's come home
from Afghanistan.

45
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:30,437
How you doing, dad?
Good to see you.

46
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,152
How come you didn't pick
me up at the airport?

47
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,864
He was with us at the movies.

"Gary and His Half Brother"

00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:44,040
VO By : ¤Aka¤

50
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,621
Team Subs-Addicts"

51
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:51,034
So we're 200 miles outside of Kabul.
I'm in the lead vehicle.

52
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,625
My tour gunner spots something up ahead,
and it's moving erratically.

53
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,759
So we don't take any chances.
We call in an air strike.

54
00:02:58,307 --> 00:02:59,522
5 minutes later...

55
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,480
Get down!

56
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:15,680
Turns out, it was just a goat.

57
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,681
You killed a goat?

58
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:20,455
No. We missed him by 11 kilometers.

59
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:25,818
Little fella came on board with us.
He was our mascot for the next 8 months.

60
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,530
Till Christmas. Then we ate him.

61
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,745
I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
We didn't eat him.

62
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:40,166
So am I old enough for you to explain
this half-brother thing to me?

63
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:41,306
Sure.

64
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,264
Well, your uncle Mitch and i, we

65
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,816
we have different mothers
who live far apart and

66
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,457
summers we would spend with dad.

67
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:51,704
Wait, grandpa Jack had 2 wives?

68
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,922
You want to handle that Mclovin'?

69
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:58,884
Well, it was the late sixties.

70
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:02,030
We were not really
married officially.

71
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:05,726
Brother groovy said these are your old
ladies for as long as it's cool, and...

72
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:10,646
But grandpa Jack loved
both these women very much.

73
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,630
That's why daddy and uncle Mitch
are half-brothers. The end.

74
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,132
Yeah, but how can grandpa
Jack be in love with 2 women?

75
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:20,229
You love peanut butter
and Jelly, right?

76
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,225
And if you can have them both
at the same time.

77
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:23,697
I said the end! OK?

78
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:28,003
Anyway, I'm gonna go, OK?

79
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,514
Mitch, congratulations
on your retirement.

80
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:32,699
- It's really great to have you back.
- Thank you.

81
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,809
I'm just glad to be someplace where i'm
not forced to go to Toby Keith concert.

82
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,930
Well, if there's anything I can
do for you, just let me know.

83
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:42,961
- Great. Will you marry me?
- You.

84
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:47,196
Come on, Allison. Don't tell me Gary's
in your league and I'm not.

85
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,521
Well, Gary was never in
my league to begin with.

86
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:53,239
He's more like a drunk spectator
who ran onto the field.

87
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:59,922
Gary, I'm going to be by tomorrow
to pick up Louise for golf camp.

88
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:01,216
Please rember.

89
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,971
Tommy's paper. Herbert hoover.
10 pages. I got it.

90
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,088
We're gonna take care of it.
You heard her, Tom.

91
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:08,736
I want 2 pages written
by 10:00 tonight.

92
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:12,257
And if I catch you in your room
horsing around... she's gone. Listen,

93
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,884
Louise, you're in charge of food.

94
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,424
Order meat lover's.
You can eat around the murder.

95
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:20,746
All right.
Tommy, you're in charge of beers, OK?

96
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,211
Imported before domestics,
bottles before cans.

97
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:26,058
If you get to a point where daddy's
drinking domestic out of a can,

98
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,587
tell me it's time for bed.

99
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,807
- Gotcha, dad.
- Hey, look.

100
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,461
We only doing this cause your uncle
Mitch is home and it's a big deal.

101
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:35,812
But tomorrow you got to get
started on that paper, OK?

102
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,036
OK, fine.

103
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:43,982
- What's so funny?
- You as a dad. It always cracks me up.

104
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,177
I'm a better dad
than you were a marine.

105
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,172
Really? I had an entire
platoon follow my every order.

106
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:53,003
- You can barely control 2 kids.
- Yeah, but you had a gun.

107
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,456
So you're really gonna make
me sleep on this couch?

108
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,362
No, you don't have to
sleep on the couch.

109
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:01,610
You can get the bottom
bunk in Tommy's room, too.

110
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:04,195
- Or I could have your room.
- You're not getting my room.

111
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:06,406
- I'll wrestle you for it.
- No. What?

112
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,337
- You're gonna Wrestle for it.
- We're not children. We're not gonna

113
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:12,146
Wrestle every time you don't get
your way like when we were kids.

114
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,141
- Give me your room.
- No, not give me my room.

115
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,154
- To sleep on the couch.
- Don't want the couch.

116
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:19,358
- How about the bottom bunk in Tommy's.
- I don't want the bottom bunk.

117
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:20,544
Wrestle.

118
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:37,964
You got movement at your 3:00.
Swoop in and fire.

119
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,387
Swoop in and fire!

120
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,802
It's too loud!

121
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,517
I got the enemy all over here.
Louise, help!

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,951
Hang on.
Let me switch to my grenade launcher.

123
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,994
Die, you Nazi scum!

124
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:53,770
Guys!

125
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,460
- Hey, Gar.
- Hi, dad.

126
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:58,990
Hi, daddy.

127
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,254
It's a little loud.

128
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,667
Sorry, hippie.

129
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:07,982
You know what else is loud?
Real war.

130
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,926
Louise, "die, you Nazi scum"?

131
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,569
Big fan of the Nazis?

132
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:21,312
Great. You probably woke
up all the neighbors.

133
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,298
Good job. Really...
all right!

134
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,758
What the hell's going on, Brooks?
It's 2 in the am.

135
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:31,145
Hey, Mr. Piscazzi. They were
playing a video game.

136
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,991
Excuse me.
Good evening, sir.

137
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:35,137
Staff Sergeant Mitchell Brooks.

138
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,575
We had an audio malfunction
with the gaming device,

139
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:41,412
- but the situation's been remedied.
- I wake up early. I watercise.

140
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:43,610
Of course you do.

141
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:47,025
Even through your robe, I can see
you pursue an intense fitness regime.

142
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,839
Don't worry about it. You won't be
bothered again for the rest

143
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,613
of the night. You have my word.

144
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,309
All right. You got it.

145
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,331
Don't worry about nothing.

146
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,585
Keep it down.

147
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,790
Great job, Mitch.
You almost got us all whacked.

148
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:08,329
- Come on, kids, go to bed, OK?
- All right.

149
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,630
I'm sorry, man, all right.
Kids were keeping me company.

150
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:14,543
Besides, after I woke them up,
they couldn't get back to sleep.

151
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:18,262
I'm going back to bed.
I got to work in the morning.

152
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:20,440
Since you're here.

153
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,248
You want help me get
through the next level? Come on.

154
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,144
- No. I have to go to work.
- I'll wrestle you for it.

155
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:28,496
I'm going to bed.

156
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,559
I can't believe you bit me.

157
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:42,421
War is hell.

158
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,859
Morning, dad.

159
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,930
I see reveille's a little
Loosey-Goosey around here.

160
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,073
Grab some chow.

161
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,159
Uncle Mitch let me
and tom cook breakfast.

162
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:58,296
Here's the thing, Mitch. We usually
don't cook breakfast in the kitchen

163
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,342
because of, well, this and...

164
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,697
I fired the cleaning lady.
I had to 'cause she divorced me.

165
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:10,123
Don't worry about it. We'll jump on KP.
As soon as we're done playing hoops.

166
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,619
- Let's go.
- Hey, we don't have a hoop.

167
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,521
We do now. Uncle Mitch Rolled
Mr. Piscazzi's over to our driveway.

168
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,481
You stole that guy's hoop?

169
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:22,974
Gary, I fought for the man's freedom,
all right?

170
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,015
I think he'd want me to have it.

171
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:27,464
Let's go!

172
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,403
Hey, hot stuff, wait a minute.
You got a herbert hoover report.

173
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,245
I have today and tomorrow, dad.

174
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:38,208
Well, OK. I don't want you fooling
around with the margins this time.

175
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,455
Your last report looked
like a Grocery list.

176
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:44,266
It won't be that hard.
Herbert hoover was born.

177
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:48,188
He did some stuff.
He was president. I'm already on page 6.

178
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:54,783
Hey, you guys can play for 15 minutes.
That's it.

179
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,638
Man.

180
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,344
I see you're doing the dishes.

181
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:15,809
I have a question.
Why are the kids outside

182
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:19,570
- playing basketball in their pajamas?
- 'cause they both Suck at rugby?

183
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,152
Gary, Louise has to be at
golf camp in 40 minutes.

184
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:25,455
I bet Tom hasn't even
start on his report.

185
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,515
Really?
How much would you like to bet?

186
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:30,197
- Hundred dollars.
- I was bluffing. He hasn't started.

187
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:33,948
Louise, Tom, get in here.
Gary, this is typical of you.

188
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,471
I'm taking tom back to my house
to make sure he'll get it done.

189
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:40,080
Time out.
This is my house, my kids, my rules.

190
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,973
Back off. He'll get it done.
He's playing with his uncle. Relax.

191
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:45,116
Listen, how many times
do I have to say this?

192
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:47,506
You can't have fun
until the work is done.

193
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,396
That's a good one, Scary Poppins.

194
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:55,200
Louise, go get ready for golf camp.
Tom, start your report.

195
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,947
The kids are with me.
They go by my rules.

196
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,334
If you'll excuse me.

197
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:03,107
Just, do what your mom said.

198
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:05,782
I'll move it back, Mr. Piscazzi.

199
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:07,875
What's that?

200
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:09,491
You're awesome.

201
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:15,272
- Hi, Allison.
- Hi.

202
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,596
Did you get prettier
since last night?

203
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,342
God, Mitch, i'm a mess.

204
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:24,298
Gary, how'd you let
this one get away?

205
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:27,286
I lit the barn on fire
and slapped her on the ass.

206
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,421
You know Mitch,
you got all the looks,

207
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:37,057
the charm, the brains, and, Gary,

208
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,493
you got to give me half
of everything you own.

209
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,221
I gotta go get to work

210
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,713
and I'm gonna bring Tommy
to make sure he finishes his report?

211
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,489
Don't do that.
He'll do it here.

212
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:53,120
Didn't you hear what Allison said?
He's gotta finish. It's important.

213
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,672
I'll make sure he gets it done. How?

214
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:59,727
You can't wrestle Tommy into writing
a report. I tried. It doesn't work.

215
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:03,930
I know how important this is.
Once I know my mission, i'm on it.

216
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,644
- You sure?
- It's done.

217
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,621
- Tom report? You'll clean the kitchen?
- Done. Done.

218
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,095
- Mr. Piscazzi?
- Dead.

219
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:14,536
No, just bring him
his hoop back, OK?

220
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:15,999
Right. Glad I asked.

221
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,557
Hey, you guys!

222
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:28,080
Here.

223
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,063
- This is not KFC.
- Yes, it is.

224
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:33,393
It's the new grilled chicken.
You'll like it.

225
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:35,462
It's so tender.

226
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:38,168
You can taste all
the herbs and spices.

227
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:42,083
Do you think it's, like,
five herbs and six spices?

228
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,118
I don't know.
Just eat it, OK?

229
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,630
What if it's, like, ten herbs

230
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:49,224
and one amazing spice?

231
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:54,168
I hope this conversation never ends.

232
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,128
Hey, Mitch, it's Gary.

233
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,529
Hey, Gary.
What's going on?

234
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,975
Tom's almost done with
the greatest report on hoover ever.

235
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:06,268
That's great.
Come on home. I picked up dinner.

236
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,185
We had a little car trouble.
We might not be home for a while.

237
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:12,279
I'll come pick you up.
Where are you guys?

238
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,625
Las Vegas.

239
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:16,631
Nevada?

240
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:20,246
People are smoking indoors and drinking
outdoors, so I'm gonna say yeah, Nevada.

241
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,220
Dad, god, you got here fast.

242
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:37,701
You drive really fast when your kids
have been taken across state lines.

243
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,248
We crossed a state line?

244
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:43,360
Yes, and when you're done
with your report on hoover,

245
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:46,181
we can start one on
the geography of the southwest.

246
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,610
Where's Mitch?
He's in the casino.

247
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,105
OK, I'm gonna go kill him.

248
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,822
Call the concierge, tell them I need
a big bag of lime and a shovel.

249
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,755
Hey, when you see uncle Mitch, tell him
we have tickets to Danny Gans, 11:00.

250
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:04,601
No, you don't. You don't have tickets
to Danny Gans at 11:00,

251
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:07,453
'cause you're gonna be in
the car with me at 11:00. And that's it!

252
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:09,586
Hey, Gar.

253
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,698
This is, Awkward.

254
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:17,925
We only have three
tickets for Danny Gans.

255
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:22,000
No one is going to Danny Gans, OK?

256
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:25,315
What, you called in sick to work so you
can go on a road trip Vegas with Mitch?

257
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,262
- Why didn't you just tell me that?
- You never would have signed off on it.

258
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,974
Let's not play that game, son.

259
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,111
I want you guys dressed and packed.

260
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:35,449
Meet me in the lobby
in 15 minutes, OK?

261
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,924
Fifteen minutes.

262
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,120
You know,
I just got back from the war.

263
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,200
So if you're looking to tie a yellow
ribbon around something,

264
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:50,134
I've got a few suggestions for you.

265
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,922
Hey. What the hell are you doing?!

266
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:01,363
Going with the ten,
that's what I'm doing.

267
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:03,924
Are you crazy,
bringing Tommy all the way out here?

268
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,387
I told you on the phone.
We were at home

269
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:10,096
working on his report, and the place
was all messy and depressing.

270
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:12,226
- You know?
- Whose fault is that?

271
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:15,471
Hey, it's not my fault you
divorced your hot cleaning lady.

272
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:23,293
So instead of cleaning up,
you come to Vegas?

273
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:25,357
Yeah, his report was on hoover,

274
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,010
so I figured hoover dam's
only a couple hours away by car.

275
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:30,856
- It's four hours away by car.
- Three, grandma.

276
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:34,503
- Here, blow on these.
- Time out. Six the hard way.

277
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:37,138
- There you go.
- Give it, give it, give it.

278
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:45,055
So you tossed my son in a car,
and you dragged him across the desert?!

279
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,634
We stopped in barstow for lunch.

280
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,948
By the way, have you had this
grilled chicken from KFC?

281
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,452
It was amazing.

282
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:55,152
You should have called me.
You should have called me.

283
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,005
It's chicken, man.

284
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,833
I thought I'd just tell you
the next time I saw you.

285
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:01,816
- He has a paper due.
- I know.

286
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,448
He's doing it.
He's just doing it in Las Vegas.

287
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,874
- We had a lot of fun today.
- You can't have fun

288
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:08,253
until the work is done.

289
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,567
- Did I just say that?
- I know I didn't.

290
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,590
Oh my gosh! Do you see what
you've done ou big ummy?

291
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,624
You've turned me into Allison.
We're leaving, now.

292
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,446
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're leaving.

293
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,683
You're gonna march upstairs,
pack your bags.

294
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,648
- We're going home. Let's go.
- Stop yelling at me, Allison.

295
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,377
Don't call me Allison.
We're leaving.

296
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:33,180
You sure? 'cause I got you a room.
It's under the name "Allison."

297
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:45,995
Excuse me.
Officer.

298
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,056
What now?

299
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,091
I have it on good authority
that this prisoner

300
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:52,566
is smuggling drugs
somewhere on his person.

301
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,791
- Where would that be?
- In his vagina.

302
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:03,755
Give me that.

303
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,144
Great. Now we don't have a broom.

304
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,925
What happened to you, man?
You used to be fun.

305
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,220
I have children, Mitch, OK?

306
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,237
When you have children, somebody
has to be the responsible adult.

307
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,740
Usually that's Allison,
but when you come to town,

308
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,875
you act like me,
so I have to act like Allison.

309
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,071
- I'm just acting like me.
- You're not acting like you

310
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:28,387
you're acting like me.
Staying up past the kids' bedtime,

311
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,953
playing video games off time,
driving off to Vgas.

312
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:33,158
That's classic me.
You're stealing my bit.

313
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:36,200
And the worst part is,
now because you're around,

314
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:39,701
I see point of view on everything. I've
made that woman's life a living hell.

315
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:42,632
And if you ever tell her I said that,
I swear to god I will kill you.

316
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:47,479
Not if I kill you first. Which I could
do right now with anything in this room.

317
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,661
- No, you couldn't.
- Go ahead, find something.

318
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:04,161
- I was just looking for a paper clip.
- I know.

319
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,223
These your sons?

320
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:09,629
'fraid so.

321
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,680
Didn't believe in spanking, did you?

322
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,110
I thought I raised you
guys better than this.

323
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:21,183
Dad, you didn't raise us at all.

324
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:24,239
Well, then this was inevitable.

325
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,669
- He started it!
- He tackled me!

326
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:30,305
- He said I had a vagina. You do.
- Hey, knock it off! Knock it off.

327
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:31,772
Look at you two.

328
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,633
Gah, fighting like teenagers.
You should be helping each other out.

329
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,112
You both have been through
terrible situations.

330
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,529
One of you's been in a
senseless quagmire fighting

331
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:42,731
a devious enemy,

332
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:44,992
and Mitch was in a war.

333
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,817
You should have each other's backs.

334
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:54,153
You're family...
I'm pretty sure.

335
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,792
- Dad's right, you know.
- Sorry, dad. Thanks.

336
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,902
All right, you two can go.
Your fine's been paid.

337
00:19:03,922 --> 00:19:05,787
I had to cash in
the danny gans tickets.

338
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:06,812
Sorry, grandpa.

339
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,935
All right. His act hasn't been the same
since his partner got eaten by a tiger.

340
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:15,887
- Dad, I'm pretty sure that Mitch,
- Why? Why? Just...

341
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,251
so I guess we're driving home, then.

342
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,496
That would be
the responsible thing to do.

343
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:26,088
It's a Shame.
Got a free hotel suite, drink coupons.

344
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,873
Car's not gonna be
ready till tomorrow.

345
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:29,871
It would be responsible
to drive home.

346
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,258
Dad, will you watch
tom for a couple hours?

347
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,031
'cause me and my brother
are gonna go hit the tables!

348
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:42,328
All right, i'm proud of you guys.

349
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:45,399
You know, getting out of Jail,
going out gambling together.

350
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,026
I can't wait to tell your sister.

351
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,629
We have a sister?

352
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,970
Yeah, you remember that peanut
Butter and Jelly, you know?

353
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:58,671
Well, it turns out I may have washed
it down with a glass of hot chocolate.

354
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,541
- Hey, you guys didn't Both.
- Top drawer.

355
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:09,502
Amazing.

356
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:11,914
Tommy did a really
great job on his report.

357
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:15,469
He really did. Mitch and I just took
turns staying with him in his bedroom,

358
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:18,237
making sure he didn't horse around,
and he got the job done.

359
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,293
This section on the hoover dam
It's almost like he was there.

360
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:26,785
That's the internet for you.
It can take you anywhere in the world.

361
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,377
- Great job, Gary. Thank you.
- Thank you.

362
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,548
This is for you.

363
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,556
- What is it?
- Just open it. Go ahead.

364
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:40,198
Gary. It's beautiful.
What is this for?

365
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,252
Just, just you put up with
a lot of stuff, so that's for you.

366
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:46,369
- It's really sweet.
- Thank you. You got it.

367
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,487
I'm gonna go home. Mitch and I are gonna
have a couple beers and unwind from

368
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:53,315
all the work we put in helping
Tommy with his report.

369
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:55,029
So how was danny gans?

370
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:58,062
We had to sell the tickets
so Tommy could bail us out of Jail.

371
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,559
- This is not over!
- It never is!

372
