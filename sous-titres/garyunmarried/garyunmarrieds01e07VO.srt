1
00:00:00,372 --> 00:00:02,995
All right, Walter.
You are all packed for your conference.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,990
Care to hear my opening
joke for my talk on schizophrenia?

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:09,434
I would love to! No, I wouldn't! Yes,
I would! No, I wouldn't! Shut up!

4
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,889
That's better than what I have.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,435
Hi, Allison. I'm here for the kids.
You packed a bag! What's the matter?

6
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:23,118
Allison dumped you
for someone even older?

7
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:27,859
I'm attending a seminar for
the top mariage therapists in the state.

8
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,858
Well, if you guys are all there,
who is gonna stay behind

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,225
and pump force people
that have no business staying married?

10
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,285
OK, kids! Your dad's here!

11
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,572
Put the wooden dummies of yourselves in
your bed and shimmy down the air ducts.

12
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:42,271
We don't want to alert the warden.

13
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:47,168
Allison, are you sure you're gonna be
all right spending this weekend alone,

14
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,649
specifically saturday?

15
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,959
Well, of course, Walter.
Don't, don't worry about me.

16
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:54,955
The 17th is no longer Gary's
and my anniversary. Just another day.

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,622
Don't be surprised if some unexpected
feelings bubble to the surface,

18
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:01,757
you know, Anger, resentment, sadness.

19
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,704
Yeah. I think you mean more like Joy,

20
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,499
relief, freedom,
and a little bit of this.

21
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,925
Don't worry, Walter.

22
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:14,103
I am going to stay home. I'm gonna
put this anniversary behind me.

23
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:16,657
I'm gonna fix myself a little drink, and

24
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,230
read this trashy little novel
I just bought, Nadia's secret."

25
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:22,943
You should also light some candles,
you should

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,353
Draw a Bath,
you should pleasure yourself.

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,521
- By that, you don't mean.
- Yes, I do.

28
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:34,759
The point is, you have
to reclaim the 17th for Allison.

29
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:37,167
I wouldn't be surprised
if Gary wasn't experiencing some

30
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,390
- of these unexpected feelings himself.
- What, are you kidding me? I mean,

31
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:43,254
Gary hasn't remembered
our anniversary once in 15 years.

32
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,137
Why, why the hell
would he rember it now?

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,272
His subconscious may remind him.
The human mind is complex.

34
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:51,670
Yeah? Well, the Gary mind is
powered by a hamster on a wheel, so...

35
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:56,692
All right.
The kids will be down in a minute.

36
00:01:56,775 --> 00:02:00,700
Don't forget the kids each
have sleepovers on saturday, the 17th.

37
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:03,540
Yeah, I know.
You told me last saturday, the tenth.

38
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:08,793
So, Gary, what exactly are
you doing this saturday, the 17th?

39
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:13,108
Why do you guys keep asking me about
saturday? What, are you gonna Rob me?

40
00:02:14,142 --> 00:02:16,892
If you are, it would be kind of silly
considering all the good stuff

41
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,344
I used to own is here.

42
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,405
Louise, honey, if you get homesick
at your sleepover, call your dad, OK?

43
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,261
- OK, mom.
- You, too, Tommy. Call me.

44
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:29,958
And, you know, if you get drunk.
Kidding. Call a cab. Let's go.

- Yeah! Yes!

49
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,782
You hide in the pocket,
you get your bell rung, princess.

50
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:49,723
I'm a pretty Lucky guy. I got beautiful
girlfriend that brings me cold beer,

51
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:52,212
and she isn't afraid to
talk smack about brett favre.

52
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:55,137
I'd say it to his unshaven face.

53
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,594
- I'm a dolphins girl, remember?
- I remember.

54
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,903
You know, once, Allison and I went
to a dolphins game in Miami in 1996.

55
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,860
You and Allison?

56
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:06,173
We were down there because
her grandmother passed away,

57
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:08,322
and thank god the game
went into sudden death.

58
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:11,316
Otherwise, we would have completely
forgotten about the funeral.

59
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:14,350
Hey, dad. We're hungry.

60
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,684
Didn't I feed you
guys twice already today?

61
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,383
You guys are expensive pets,
i'll tell you that.

62
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,426
Well, if anyone has any objections
to Chinese food,

63
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,388
is suggest you try to beat
the speed dial.

64
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:28,326
How about something healthy,
something like salad or fish or.

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,749
Hi. Ming Palace?

66
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,704
Hi. How are you? It's Gary.

67
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,682
Yes. Well, thank you very much.
There's 4 of us tonight.

68
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,159
Well, I'll see you when you get here.

69
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,861
- You got to learn to talk fasterlouise.
- Sorry. I froze.

70
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,702
And you want to be on "jeopardy"?

71
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,763
How does that restaurant
know exactly what

72
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,886
to bring you just by
hearing your first name?

73
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,530
Allison and I used to order
from here all the time.

74
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,305
OK. I have something to say.

75
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:57,576
It's a small thing, but it's
starting to get a little irritating.

76
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:01,261
Oh, my god. Please don't be an STD.
I've made it to almost 40.

77
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,626
You say, "Allison and i," all the time.

78
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,422
Really? Should it be "Allison and me"?

79
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:11,668
Look out, look out!

80
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:15,471
No. Gary, you talk about
your ex-wife constantly.

81
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,156
It's kind of like she's
a part of our relationship.

82
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:21,393
I mean, all we do, we sit on the couch,
and we eat takeout food,

83
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,853
and we talk about stuff
that you and Allison used to do.

84
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,567
Then this is a big miscommunication

85
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,211
because I kind of thought
that's what you wanted to do.

86
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,530
OK. I don't mean to sound conceited,

87
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,599
but look at this, OK?
Look at this!

88
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,596
All right. Men have literally
beaten up other men for this.

89
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,365
Complete strangers have bought
me food and clothes and drinks.

90
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,802
A guy once offered me a car
if I would run through his sprinklers

91
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:49,185
in my sundress.

92
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,305
- What kind of car?
- My jeep.

93
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,847
Come on, Gary! Take me out.
You know, just show me off.

94
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,661
Let's just start acting
like a real couple.

95
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:04,335
I hate to break it to you.
You kind of ruined the surprise.

96
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:07,166
- What surprise?
- The surprise of the big, fancy dinner

97
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,127
I was gonna take you to tomorrow night.

98
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,267
All right. You know, you don't have to
say that just because I brought it up.

99
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,670
No. I was going to.

100
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:17,023
I'm really taking you out to a place.
It's I've been planning on it.

101
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:19,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:22,418
OK. Can you give me a hint?

103
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,879
Well, I can't I'm terrible at keeping
secrets, but I hope you like food.

104
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:27,629
See? Look. I already said too much.

105
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,663
Is it a cool place?
Is it a new place?

106
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,266
- Is it a cool, new pace?
- It is both a cool and a new place, OK,

107
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:40,546
and we will not mention anyone's name
who happens to be my ex-wife, all right?

108
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:44,377
This is gonna be so great!
I already know what i'm gonna wear, OK?

109
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,964
You better promise me you're
not making this up, though.

110
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:50,871
I swear on my kids'lives.

111
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,171
Hey, guys. Be real careful
the next couple of days, OK?

112
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,715
Did you swear on our lives again?

113
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,142
I am tired of tiptoeing
through life, dad!

114
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:13,883
Gee whiz! Help yourself, Dennis.

115
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,513
I'm sorry.
There's no food at my house.

116
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,460
- My wife started another diet today.
- Then why are you so hungry?

117
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,544
Well, last night at 11:58,
she went on a rampage.

118
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,303
She ate everything in the house.

119
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,026
It was horrible to watch.
There was meat on the ceiling fan.

120
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:31,723
That's awful.

121
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:34,112
The worst part is, I can't find my dog.

122
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:40,447
Hello? Hi. Is this...

123
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,359
How do you pronounce the name
of your restaurant? Is it plah-tay?

124
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:47,715
Really?
It's just plate?

125
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:52,797
That's the best you guys
could come up with was plate?

126
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,215
Well, I would like a reservation
for two for tomorrow night.

127
00:06:58,373 --> 00:06:59,759
You're all booked up?

128
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:03,943
OK. What I meant to say
was i'm calling to confirm

129
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:06,657
a reservation that I already
made for tomorrow night.

130
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,345
Yeah. Well, I could tell you my name,

131
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,989
but it's probably more
fun if you guess my name.

132
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,891
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

133
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,836
I've been on the phone for two hours.
Not one restaurant in this guide

134
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,656
can fit me in on a saturday night?

135
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,691
Why did you wait until the last minute?

136
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,327
I've forgotten how to do this, Dennis.
You know, I haven't

137
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,987
gone out on a date in 15 years.
I'm out of practice.

138
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:31,234
The only restaurant I ever
used to go to was leo's with Allison.

139
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:34,786
Hey. That's what i'll do. I'll bring
Vanessa to leo's. That will be great.

140
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:37,916
No. Don't take her to leo's,
man, and don't get me wrong.

141
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:39,667
I enjoyed their left overs.

142
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:42,627
You and Allison ate there,
like, 100 times.

143
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,672
I know. That's why it's perfect.
The food's good, I know the maitre D',

144
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,812
there's no bathroom attendant
so it's free to pee. It'll be great!

145
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,863
And the last time I was
at leo's was a long time ago.

146
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,255
It was, last time I was there
was mine and Allison's anniversary.

147
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,714
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

148
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,283
I totally forgot.
I'm an idiot.

149
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,148
We got to pick up the paint
for that job on arlington.

150
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:09,285
- Man, you have a great memory.
- Thank you, brother.

151
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,412
You know, Allison never thought so.

152
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,475
OK. Here's to you. The 17th,

153
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,451
you are no longer a day
of any significance to me whatsoever.

154
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,365
Except in march when you're st.
Paddy's day, OK?

155
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,591
OK. That's only fun with other people.

156
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,308
All right, Nadia.

157
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:36,778
Let's see what your big
damn secret is all about.

158
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:39,668
Here we go.

159
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:44,520
"At first glance,
the manor house appeared drab to Nadia."

160
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:50,544
"No longer a stable boy, he
had grown into a strong, handsome man."

161
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,086
"Tears open her bodice."

162
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:57,956
"Pulsating manhood."

163
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:02,559
"As he wept over her dying body."
For god sakes!

164
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:10,171
Now anxiety issues come in many flavors.

165
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,822
All right.
Whose cell phone is that?

166
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:15,140
We're very clear.
No cell phones or pagers at all.

167
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,619
You're asked to mute them,
to not bring them int...

168
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,357
Sorry. I think that's me.

169
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,430
This is fortuitous.

170
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,569
I was just about to talk
about postdivorce anxiety,

171
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:31,222
and my fiancÉe is grappling
with these issues as we speak.

172
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:33,910
So let's see if she's up
for participating

173
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,790
for an educational purpose.

174
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,115
- Allison, how are you?
- I am horrible, Walter.

175
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,432
Before we carry on, I need to disclose.

176
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,159
I lit candles,
I ran a bath, I pleasured myself.

177
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,442
That you are on the speakerphone.

178
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,418
Walter, get me off.

179
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,258
Do you mind?

180
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,068
- Allison you sound troubled.
- Walter, I don't know what to do.

181
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,931
I've tried to put this anniversary
thing out of my head, and I can't.

182
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:02,849
If staying at home is causing you
anxiety, leave the house,

183
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:04,110
treat yourself,

184
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:07,064
reclaim this date for yourself, Allison.

185
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,893
OK. I guess I could take
myself out for a night on the town.

186
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,917
Yes. You've got the finger
on the button of your own happiness.

187
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:16,836
Pipe down, you animals!

188
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:21,744
I'm gonna tell the
maitre d'we're here, OK?

189
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,046
Paulie.

190
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:26,627
Gary brooks, where the hell
have you been? How's the wife?

191
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,312
No, it's not me. You don't know me.

192
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,621
Then I'm sorry. Were full.
Please try another night.

193
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,787
No, Paulie.
I mean, pretend you don't know me,

194
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,286
pretend I've never been here before,
you know what I mean?

195
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,815
I understand, Gary.
Getting a little something on the side.

196
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,866
No, no, no.
There's nothing on the side.

197
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,405
What's nothing on the side?

198
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:45,053
There's no baked potatoes on
the side, side orders of baked potato.

199
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:47,655
You have to get rice pilaf, mashed,

200
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,391
French fries, please seat us.

201
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,984
- Yes. Your table's right here.
- Thank you, Paulie. Pally, pal, sir.

202
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:54,677
Here. Have.

203
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,631
Where'd you get the glass of wine?

204
00:10:57,872 --> 00:11:01,817
At the bar from the big
screen tv king of San Diego.

205
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,076
King of big screen,
and all you got was a glass of wine?

206
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:09,256
"This card good for one big screen Tv."

207
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:14,116
Oh, my god. This place is so sweet.

208
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,475
Does this mean that leo's
is gonna be our restaurant?

209
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:19,360
Yes, this is ours, OK?

210
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:21,635
Now all we have to do is get a bird,
a flower, and

211
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,700
a tree and we can apply for statehood.

212
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,225
Can I be your first lady?

213
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:29,215
No. I'm sorry,
but you'll always be my fourth.

214
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,405
- Really?
- Four well, I'm a guy.

215
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,674
I don't expect you to rack
up those kind of numbers, but, yeah.

216
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,652
So far, our first grownup
date is going very beautifully.

217
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,280
Yes, it is,

218
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:46,670
and as promised, not one mention
of Allison, except for that one,

219
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:49,671
which I mentioned only to illustrate
the point that I'm not gonna

220
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,463
say Allison. That's twice. I'm sorry,
but I'm done with the Allisons.

221
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,254
3. Darn. Allison. There. 4. I'm sorry.
When I get nervous, I have this thing

222
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:00,640
where I have to end everything with even
numbers. Used to make Allison crazy.

223
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:02,775
Damn it! Allison.
6. I'm done.

224
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,155
Good.

225
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:07,913
Good. Because tonight
is about Gary and Vanessa.

226
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:10,297
And my son.

227
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:13,557
I'm sorry. I told him that I would
talk to him before bed.

228
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,574
- Would you excuse me?
- Of course.

229
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,899
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here with Vanessa on a date.

230
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,830
You brought your girlfriend here?

231
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,284
To our restaurant?

232
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:52,939
- On our anniversary?
- On our what now?

233
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,731
Gary, it's the 17th.

234
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,072
- It's our anniversary.
- Yes, it is. It's our anniversary.

235
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:02,364
I know because I got you a gift online,

236
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,099
and it's still being shipped,
but I have a tracking number. It's 11.

237
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,925
Gary, we're not married.
You don't have to lie anymore.

238
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:12,305
Sorry. I can't help it.
It's like a gag reflex. Listen.

239
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:15,167
You have to get out of here.
You have to go, OK?

240
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,639
- I am not gonna leave. You leave.
- No. I can't leave.

241
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,511
I'm here with Vanessa.
You have to leave.

242
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:22,621
I promised Vanessa we would have a nice,
romantic evening together

243
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,275
and I wouldn't mention you once,
and that's gonna be hard to do

244
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:27,139
to do with a big, fat you sitting here.

245
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,716
No, Gary. I am reclaiming this
date for myself in our restaurant,

246
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,739
- which used to be mine by the way.
- What if Vanessa sees you?

247
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:36,145
I'll wave. I like her.

248
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,906
Here's the plan.
We have to keep the pretty one

249
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,910
from seeing the angry one, you follow?

250
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,654
- Take her that way.
- I will.

251
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,858
- Hi. How are you? Let's go!
- What's wrong?

252
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:53,034
Nothing. I just didn't like our table,
and the one I wanted finally opened up.

253
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:55,162
Look at this one. This is even better.

254
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,341
- This is the table that you wanted?
- Yes, it is.

255
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:00,469
- It's kind of big.
- I thought maybe we could

256
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:03,270
play ping-pong later if things got dull.
Here. Have a seat.

257
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:07,320
Don't you want to sit here so you
can see this wonderful original

258
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:09,292
art by Ralph Macchio?

259
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,733
I can't. You know how you
have your thing with even numbers?

260
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:15,778
I can't sit with my back
facing towards the door.

261
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,973
Why not? What,
is your family in the Mafia?

262
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,803
Don't ever ask me about my business.

263
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:30,121
Hey, look! They have paper,
and on it they write what the food is.

264
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:32,957
I have been to a restaurant,
just not one with you.

265
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,694
You know what? Why don't we have a.
Why don't we have a caesar salad?

266
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:37,596
- You want a caesar salad?
- I don't know.

267
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,196
Me, too. Me, too. Right.
To your right. Your right. There you go.

268
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,593
- Perfecto.
- Caesar salad for two?

269
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,914
Yes. That would be delightful, and
take your time. We love the pageantry.

270
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:51,444
Where are you gonna go?
You're gonna miss the pageantry.

271
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:54,978
Yeah, I know, but I left my water on
that other table, and I already squeezed

272
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,937
Lemon into it, and who wants
to go through that drama again?

273
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,584
Allison, please.
You've got to get out of here.

274
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:07,110
You can keep kids for an extra weekend.
I'll keep the kids for an extra weekend.

275
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:10,533
We can use the kids as currency
in any way you see fit. Just go, OK?

276
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:13,577
Gary, no. No.
I am. I am taking back my restaurant.

277
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,974
It's not your restaurant,
I'm tired of you saying

278
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:18,095
- Yes, it is!
- your restaurant. No, it's not!

279
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,998
May 31, 1992,

280
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,462
I was in here, and I bought you a drink,
and life as I knew it ended, OK?

281
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,220
You know what?
I'm here now, and I'm just

282
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,181
- gonna go look at the dessert cart.
- No. You can't go over there. Sit,

283
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,137
please.

284
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,212
Who's somebody's getting married?

285
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:38,328
Not us. No. That no.

286
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:44,044
Hey. I just. Where is she?

287
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,048
- She went to the ladies'room.
- And you let her?

288
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,945
It's kind of our policy.

289
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,336
You know what? That's OK.

290
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,611
That's good. That will give me some time
to think about what to do about Allison.

291
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:58,122
She allergic to anything,
shellfish, peanuts?

292
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,133
- The second one, yes.
- Peanuts?

293
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:01,512
Peanuts. No.

294
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:07,298
- Allison's heading to the ladies'room.
- That's good.

295
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,814
That will give me some time think about
what to do about. That did you just say?

296
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:13,736
- Both your dates are in the restroom.
- Holy moly!

297
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,943
Hi. Right this way.

298
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:21,814
Why are you giving me a dirty look?
I held the door for you.

299
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,354
Hi. How are you? You're number 34.
35? I got room for one more.

300
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:32,769
- 35?
- Sit, sit down.

301
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,384
That's it.
I'm finished. It's over.

302
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:39,776
So you think the missus
is gonna give you a divorce?

303
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:42,297
No. I am divorced, Paulie. I've been
divorced. I was here with

304
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,496
my new girlfriend. Well, she was my
girlfriend up until about a minute ago.

305
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:48,134
That's your girlfriend?
What did you take her here for?

306
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,871
I could have gotten you into plate.
My brother's the maitre D'.

307
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:51,971
Come on!

308
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,153
Hey! I.

309
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:59,350
- I owe you an apology.
- Why?

310
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,760
Didn't anything weird
happen in the bathroom?

311
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,827
Nothing I wasn't expecting.

312
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,929
Nothing unusual went
down while you were in there?

313
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:11,153
I feel like we should preserve
some of the romance, don't you?

314
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,690
Yes, yes.
Let's get out of here, OK? What?

315
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,658
Let's, let's go somewhere else.
This isn't right. I would like to take

316
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:20,240
you someplace
that really is special to me, OK?

317
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,765
The maitre D'was sweating
in the caesar salad.

318
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:31,006
You know what? I totally flaked
on the Bill. I'm gonna go pay it, OK?

319
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:34,712
- Do you need money for the valet?
- You're adorable.

320
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,659
That's right. I forgot. Hot chicks
don't have to pay for anything.

321
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,133
You're welcome.

322
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,444
Did you say anything to her in there?

323
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:52,346
I didn't say anything. I saw her fe.

324
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,259
Why didn't you say anything to her?
I thought your mission in life

325
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,740
was to destroy me.

326
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,567
Look, Gary. She has a hard enough
time as it is dating you, all right?

327
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,416
She doesn't need me to pile on.

328
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:06,590
Besides, I was.

329
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:10,749
I was kind of touched
you remembered may 31, 1992.

330
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,541
I'll never forget may 31,
1992, because I was in here,

331
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,021
and I saw the most beautiful woman I
had ever seen walk through those doors.

332
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,258
And then you came in right behind her.

333
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:30,732
- Of course.
- No, Allison.

334
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,918
You had some great points,
too, you know?

335
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:35,039
You had your Julia Roberts
hair and those

336
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,064
big, Puffy Demi Moore shoulder pads.

337
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,929
I was way out of your league, you know?

338
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:43,807
You may have been out of my league,
but I totally got inside your uniform.

339
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:49,438
Thanks for rembering the day at least.

340
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,337
- That's really sweet.
- Of course. May 31.

341
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,401
- How could I forget?
- So how is it related to sports?

342
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,242
Joe Namath's birthday.

343
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,800
Yeah. I tried making reservations
at other places like plate,

344
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:07,824
saucer, bowl.

345
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,239
They were all booked up.

346
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,225
You mad?

347
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:16,045
That you took me to a restaurant
that you and your ex-wife used to go to

348
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,497
and that she was there

349
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:22,276
and it was your anniversary?

350
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,065
So we're OK then?

351
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,126
Gary, I really like you,
but you're not divorced yet.

352
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:32,695
Oh, yes, I am.
I have half my stuff to prove it.

353
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,127
No. You're divorcing.
There's a big difference.

354
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,206
You know, you still haven't
disconnected from Allison,

355
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:43,386
and you're not gonna be ready
for a real relationship until you do.

356
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,548
Are you giving me the heave-ho?

357
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,459
Heave-ho is such an ugly

358
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,723
and nautical way to put it,

359
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,916
but maybe we should slow things down,
you know, see other people.

360
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:02,452
- You need to go exploring, man.
- Can we can we stay friends?

361
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,447
- Of course.
- With benefits?

362
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,411
Like what? Dental?

363
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:15,587
We could start. You know what?
Get your taco. Let's get out of here.

364
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,771
- Let's, let's leave.
- What the hell?

365
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:21,698
- It's not what you think, Dennis.
- You said this was our place.

366
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,003
- Sorry.
- No chicks.

367
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,688
- I know.
- I can't here,

368
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:28,517
I can't eat at home,
I can't find my dog.

369
