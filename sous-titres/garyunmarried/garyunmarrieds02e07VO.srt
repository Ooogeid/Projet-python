1
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:06,223
You're always saying I should play less
video games and get more exercise.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,321
I'm not buying you a trampoline, Tommy.

3
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:11,663
The only people that use trampolines
are clowns and cheerleaders and those

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:14,458
guys in gorilla suits
that do those summersault dunks.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,139
How am I ever gonna be one of those guys

6
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:19,649
if you won't buy me a trampoline
and a gorilla suit?!

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:23,216
I'm so tired of having this gorilla
suit trampoline argument with you.

8
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,606
Fine.
Your wish is granted.

9
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:26,442
Really?

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,898
You go on Craigslist, you find
a trampoline for under 50 bucks,

11
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:31,130
we'll go pick it up this afternoon, OK?

12
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,006
- Dad, you're the best!
- Right!

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,385
I can't believe that. One jump, you went
right through. It was like a cartoon.

14
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:43,407
You got in on video though, right?

15
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm not sure. My hand was shaking
like crazy, I was laughing so hard.

16
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:50,935
-= 207 =-
"Gary and Allisons Friend"

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,051
VO By :  ¤Aka¤

18
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,905
Team Subs-Addicts"

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,976
OK. Open the grill, Curtis.
And I'm gonna cook the final quadrant.

20
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:07,982
I'm just saying, man, this is not
how they did it on the commercial.

21
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,575
On the commercial, the guy who's selling
it got punched in the face 50,000 times.

22
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,536
He says he's an entrepreneur and a chef.

23
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:17,013
Don't believe everything you see on TV!
Oh my God!

24
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:20,505
I can't take this anymore.
I want my old grill back!

25
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:23,082
Allison got my 8-burner
weber with a rotisserie

26
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,213
and a side smoker in the divorce.

27
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:27,429
We better figure something out.
Because all of our bros

28
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:30,669
are bringing exotic sausages over
for sausage-fest this weekend!

29
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:36,167
Have we ever thought about
changing the name of sausage-fest?

30
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,404
Why would we change
the name of sausage-fest?

31
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:42,713
It's a 10-year tradition of men
getting together with their meat.

32
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:48,536
Hey, Curtis. Nice job, Gary, buying
Tom a trampoline off of Craigslist.

33
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:50,159
Do they sell loaded guns on there

34
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,644
'cause Louise would have a ball
with one of those.

35
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:56,793
Now, calm down, Allison. It was
an accident. And it was hilarious.

36
00:01:57,824 --> 00:02:00,460
Anyway, I gotta few things I want
to talk to you about. So, excuse me.

37
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,212
Bye. I gotta get going anyway. I gotta
pick up the t-shirts for sausage-fest.

38
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:06,051
You're gonna love'em, man.
They got a dude

39
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:08,234
who's shoving a 10-inch
kielbasa down his throat.

40
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:10,829
And it says "sausage-fest '09"
written underneath.

41
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:13,799
I really can't talk you
into changing the name?

42
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,041
Are you hearing something
i'm not hearing?

43
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,180
What's up?

44
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:22,836
OK. First of all, Louise has been
a little down in the dumps lately.

45
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,591
Apparently a boy she has
a crush on doesn't like her back.

46
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,120
What? Who wouldn't like Louise?
She's a total package.

47
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:30,416
She's smart. She's beautiful.
She'll tell you if you're

48
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,025
ending a sentence in a preposition.

49
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,742
Although I don't even know why
you would need to know that for.

50
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,906
Anyways, please, Gary,
just be extra sweet to her this week.

51
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:39,942
Me? Yeah.
I'm always sweet.

52
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:41,852
- Come on, get out.
- No, Gary. Hang on.

53
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:43,940
I have a favor to ask you.
You know that

54
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,811
little lingerie boutique on abbot Kinney
that you paint every year?

55
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:49,236
I need you to introduce
me to the owner Sophia.

56
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:50,127
Why?

57
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:52,879
'cause I feel like she'll cool.
And, like, we could be friends.

58
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,047
You have friends.

59
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,300
Yeah. I have married friends.
And I have mom friends.

60
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,990
And you know that book club I joined?
It turned out to be a bust.

61
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:01,593
I came in all prepared to
discuss "sense and sensibility".

62
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,269
All the women wanted to do was drink
and tell their great sex stories.

63
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,157
And thanks to you, I didn't have any.

64
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,558
1995.
Valentine's day.

65
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:16,229
Come on.
Gary, your foot slipped off the mattress

66
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:19,090
and you found a spot you never
were able to find again. Please.

67
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,774
I found it that one time, didn't i?!

68
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,731
Come on, get out of my house!

69
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:26,981
Look, Sophia just seems like
someone easygoing and laid back.

70
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,921
Kind of like me.
And that's why,

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,919
I have a very specific plan
on how to get her.

72
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,994
Phase 1 being you introduce us.

73
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,059
Hate to break this to you, Allison.

74
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:39,127
You don't make friends
with plans and phases. 2 people meet.

75
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,485
And if they hit it off,
eventually they become friends.

76
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,907
Yeah. That's not how I want to do it.

77
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,798
See, I figure with you
brokering the introduction,

78
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,737
it'll take the pressure off, you know?

79
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,231
And give us something
immediately we have in common.

80
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:54,709
Phase 2 or "making fun of you."

81
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,235
It's probably the dumbest idea
I've ever heard in my life.

82
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:01,293
But since I don't care at all,
I'll help you.

83
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,616
Thank you. Thank you.

84
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,075
For a price.

85
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,037
What?

86
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,328
I'll help you make friends with Sophia,
you give me my grill back.

87
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:11,946
Wait. OK, wait.

88
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,913
You can't do me a favor
unless you get something in return.

89
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:19,045
All right. All right. Fine.

90
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,930
It's a shame though because I found this
recipe for polenta-stuffed bell peppers.

91
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,126
Hey, I don't want to know
what you did with my grill

92
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,880
anymore than you want to know
what I did with your melon baller!

93
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,320
Gotta tell ya. Being in here
with you and all the sexy lingerie,

94
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,600
it's very odd to be so repulsed
and turned on at the same time.

95
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,805
- How are ya?
- Great.

96
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:50,804
We were just in the neighborhood.

97
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:54,655
So, we decided to pop in and see what's
happening in the world of thongs.

98
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,679
I was going to call you.
It's almost repainting time.

99
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,862
Perfect coincidence. This is the
new boss of my painting company.

100
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:04,133
It's my ex-wife Allison.
Allison, my friend Sophia.

101
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,998
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

102
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:08,640
I love your shop.
I get all my sexy whatnots here.

103
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,646
I just love your store.
I mean, you have such a good eye.

104
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:17,124
It's tasteful and Bohemian
at the same time.

105
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,566
Thank you so much.

106
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,173
I've never actually told
anyone this. But,

107
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,569
I've always wanted to open up
my own shop one day.

108
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,240
I mean, I don't know what it would be.

109
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,743
Baby clothes or candles
or maybe picture frames.

110
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,733
What would you call that store? "Stuff
you could buy at other stores" store?

111
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:35,988
Actually, the space next door

112
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,375
is available if you want
to pop over and check it out.

113
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,225
- Yeah. Great.
- Do you mind watching the place?

114
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,436
If anyone has a question,
you could just yell for me.

115
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,203
You want me to watch
your lingerie shop? Yuck.

116
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,651
Hey, Sophia,
can you tell me if this is...

117
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:52,914
Hi.

118
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,055
Everything's OK.
Sophia left.

119
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,443
And she told me to watch
the store while she's gone.

120
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,678
Great.
What do you think of this?

121
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,690
This moment.
Right now in my life?

122
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:05,369
Top 4.

123
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:09,230
It's an anniversary
present for my boyfriend.

124
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:12,776
I wanted to get him something
sexy and fun. But I can't decide.

125
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,222
So, if you were a straight guy,
would you prefer this...

126
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:18,654
Or this?

127
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,075
You're not saying anything.

128
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:28,307
Maybe I should just buy him
a videogame and forget it.

129
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:29,922
No. No. I love it.

130
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:33,052
When I say I love it, I mean
I know your boyfriend will love it.

131
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,981
'cause I love men.

132
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,256
I bet your boyfriend is yummy.

133
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:43,540
Does this bra make
my boobs look too big?

134
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,721
No. You're buying that.
You're insane.

135
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:49,867
Any problems?

136
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,145
It's been pretty quiet.

137
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,865
Listen, I'm having a little after
hours wine and cheese

138
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,041
reception tomorrow night.
You guys should come.

139
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,903
- Yeah. Definitely. Thanks.
- Great. I'll see you both then.

140
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,819
Hey, Sophia is that you?

141
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:04,527
Excuse me, guys.

142
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,746
You said you couldn't make
a friend by planning it out.

143
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,418
For your information,
I already made her laugh twice.

144
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,074
We exchanged a wheat-free muffin recipe.

145
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,606
And, she agrees that Matthew Mcconaughey

146
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:19,485
can smell as bad as he wants
as long as he keeps his shirt off.

147
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,897
Come on. I got my grill back.
So, let's hit the road. OK?

148
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,550
You know what?
It's really getting packed in here.

149
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:28,992
I better stick around
and help Sophia out. OK?

150
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:33,661
Hey, girlfriends!

151
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,508
Hey, Tommy, Curtis and I are
about to go to this party.

152
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,301
I need you to help me
out with something.

153
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:42,228
What's up?

154
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,420
You know Louise's crush
is coming over to study.

155
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:46,154
I want you to keep an eye on this kid?

156
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,608
Don't worry about it, dad.
If he tried anything funny,

157
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:50,875
he'll win front row seats
to the gun show.

158
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,586
Say hello to Smith
and Western.

159
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:58,706
It's Wesson.

160
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:01,866
It's Wesson and Western?
Wesson and Western.

161
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,774
No. It's...
doesn't matter.

162
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:06,061
When the kid comes over,
you just keep an eye on him, OK?

163
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:09,041
You know what? If anything breaks out,
ask him to jump on the trampoline.

164
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,929
- Have you met this kid?
- No. But I know the type.

165
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:16,757
You know, probably super popular,
handsome, thinks he's a badass.

166
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:19,862
Walks around breaking hearts.
Pretty much me at 12 years old.

167
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:24,714
It wasn't the year you stopped the cups
in the middle off the ride to get off?

168
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,298
You were spinning
the tea cups to fast, Curtis.

169
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,582
Tea cup ride is supposed to be fun.
Not a damn Nasa experiment.

170
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,122
All right, that's him now.
OK, remember.

171
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:40,191
This kid tries anything,
you call me immediately. You follow?

172
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:42,994
- Can I help you?
- I'm Kenny.

173
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:44,908
I'm here to study with Louise.

174
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,672
You're Kenny? Hey, come on in.
How are ya? Louise's dad.

175
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,371
These are some other people.

176
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:56,141
Come on in. Just go into the kitchen.
Make yourself at home.

177
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,525
Whatever you want. If you can't reach it
just climb up on a chair and get it.

178
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,369
That's Kenny?!
Oh my gosh.

179
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,378
That kid could pose
for bowling trophies.

180
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:09,157
You got nothing to worry about.

181
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,743
The only move that kid is
making is on a chessboard.

182
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,391
Look like I can put these bad boys away.

183
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,994
Not yet.
I'm having corn on the cob later.

184
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,221
I might need them to pick my teeth with.

185
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,564
That's a good one, dad.
That'll get a lot of laughs

186
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,504
when you're at the old folks home
and you don't get any visitors.

187
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:36,486
It's funny.
You're grounded.

188
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,704
OK. So, I think I'm gonna get
the grill back. This is great.

189
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,767
I should ask for other things I lost
in the divorce. Like my leather chair.

190
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,685
My stereo.
My "BJ and the bear" DVD box set.

191
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,912
Hello!
Remake nobody's thought of yet.

192
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,964
Bottom line is the first time in 2 years
things have been coming back my way.

193
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,291
Divorce is amazingly hard.
Everything you ever loved,

194
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:58,656
- just have to give it away to somebody.
- I hear that, man.

195
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:01,700
Second one goes down a little easier
because you ain't got nothing left.

196
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:05,860
The third one, I'll just throw her the
keys to the Corsica and be done with it.

197
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,360
- Glad you could make it.
- This is great.

198
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:15,632
You got free booze, free food.
Sexy lingerie.

199
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,659
All that's missing is...

200
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:20,701
No, you pretty much hit this one
out of the park.

201
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,693
Hey, Soph,
great party.

202
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,321
Actually I have an idea for your
next one. They make these plates

203
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:31,263
with the cup holders built right in
so you can hold your food

204
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,929
and drink in one hand and browse
through the merchandise with your other.

205
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,802
- That's a great suggestion.
- I know, right?

206
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,971
Hey, could you help me pick something
out for my girlfriend Charlene?

207
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,738
Sure. What kind of figure
does she have?

208
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,839
Let's see.
She got really big boobs.

209
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:51,128
But then she got a large waist.

210
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,021
But then she got a really big butt.

211
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:57,739
Let me pick out a few things for you.

212
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,346
Tommy, it's dad.

213
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:09,163
How's everything going over there
with Kenny? Did he try anything?

214
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:11,973
What?

215
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:14,707
Homemade French fries?
Who does that?

216
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:18,754
That's weird.
I didn't even know we had potatoes.

217
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,494
No, you're dad just likes to say things
funny sometimes. That's all, son.

218
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:29,588
Look. I'll be home soo... oon!

219
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:33,492
How soon?

220
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:36,984
- Soon-ish.
- That's great.

221
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:40,031
Because I would love for you and me
to get out of here and a grab a drink.

222
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,067
What about Allison?
What about the party?

223
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,738
You can't just walk out on your new
friend and everything. You know?

224
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,379
Listen, I feel bad. But I really
don't see Allison and I being friends.

225
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,712
I mean, she's kind of pushy and
controlling. And I'm just not into that.

226
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,602
But I am into big,

227
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:02,139
sexy, handsome guys who know their
way around women's underwear.

228
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,971
If any of those guys
don't show up, you call me.

229
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:24,575
I still can't believe it. A young,
hot woman who owns a lingerie shop

230
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,793
kisses you on the mouth
and then you run out of there

231
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,691
like she hiked up her skirt from
that scene in "the crying game."

232
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:31,926
I didn't know what to do.
This meant so much

233
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,404
to Allison to make a new friend.
I can't sleep with the lady

234
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,213
Allison want to be friends with. She'd
be mad at me. And Allison's vengeful.

235
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:38,707
One time at a Christmas party,

236
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:41,300
my elbow accidentally brushed up
against her sister's boob.

237
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,345
Next night
Allison takes my razor.

238
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,037
She starts peeling carrots with it.
So, the next morning after that,

239
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:49,291
I go to shave, the next thing I know,
my face looks like James Woods.

240
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:55,429
But Sophia doesn't like Allison.
You're not preventing anything.

241
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:58,086
That's not how Allison's going
to see it. First she'll be crushed.

242
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:00,846
Then she'll be angry. Then she'll
blame me for the whole thing.

243
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,131
This ain't right. OK.

244
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,018
You're worried about crushing Allison
and you're the one who got crushed.

245
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,401
You said it yourself.
You lost everything you care about.

246
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:09,613
And now you don't get to have
a little bit of pleasure?

247
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,909
Just because she doesn't
want to be Allison's friends,

248
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:14,708
- doesn't mean i can't sleep with her.
- Exactly.

249
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,105
So, now I wouldn't tell
Allison immediately.

250
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:20,185
I mean, not until we have
the grill physically in our possession.

251
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,876
By the time Allison figures out
that Sophia's not into her...

252
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,316
Sausage-fest will be over and done with.

253
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,056
Exactly. We will be so filled
with sausage that the thought of

254
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,137
stuffing another sausage in our mouth...

255
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:34,205
You know what, you're right. We probably
should think about changing the name.

256
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,505
Hey Louise...
I saw your homework was laying out.

257
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:42,008
So, I finished all your geometric
proofs for you.

258
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,429
What's the matter honey?
The only thing that makes you laugh

259
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:48,409
more than daddy
understands your homework

260
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:50,093
is the old video of

261
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:53,202
the hunter getting beaten up by the deer
in "animals fight back."

262
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:58,639
It's stupid Kenny. I thought we had a
lot of fun studying together last night.

263
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,759
And then today at school,
he totally ignored me.

264
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:03,679
Come on sweet girl.

265
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:05,468
Look, this is what happened.

266
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:07,996
Kenny sees a girl like you,

267
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,890
and he just thinks he's completely out
of his league. That's all.

268
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,393
So, you're saying if I like him,
I have to make the first move.

269
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,187
No. That's not what I'm saying.

270
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,941
You're not to make the first move or any
move whatsoever. Don't make any moves.

271
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,985
And if you do,

272
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,722
I don't ever want to know about it.
You can't tell me unless if I ask you.

273
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:26,532
I don't want to hear it.
But if Kenny makes the first move,

274
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,097
you have to tell me so I can
kill him.

275
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:32,736
So, don't make any moves,
and don't let him do...

276
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:35,055
you know what I'm saying.

277
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:38,974
I think what you're saying
is if I like Kenny,

278
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:41,111
I should ask him to go do something

279
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,964
but then never mention it.

280
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,171
Exactly.

281
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:48,837
You know we can talk
about anything, right?

282
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:55,507
What do you think?

283
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:58,858
It's nice. If I was a headless plastic
man, my search would be over.

284
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:03,272
Maybe you should see it on a real woman.

285
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,963
Really? You want me to just...
Oh, my God. I love those... it.

286
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,112
Look our reservation isn't for

287
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:12,720
another half hour,
so we can go over there,

288
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,864
sit at the bar,
get to know each other a little better.

289
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:17,157
Sounds great.

290
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,834
Unless there's something
else you'd rather do.

291
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:21,670
Do you?

292
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,963
Do you?

293
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:24,324
Do you?

294
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:28,137
I'm just going to pull the trigger here.

295
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:33,498
Oh, my gosh.

296
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:36,097
Hey, that was incredible.

297
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,819
Look our reservation isn't for
like another half hour,

298
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:41,692
if you want we could get to know
each other a little better.

299
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,237
No, I'm just going to save us some
time and pull the trigger here.

300
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:50,064
My trigger doesn't make that noise.

301
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,447
It's probably the U.P.S guy.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

302
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:56,720
I think I've seen this movie.

303
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:01,776
Coming!

304
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:07,853
Hey, I was in the neighborhood.

305
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:15,052
God. I'm so sorry.
Are you getting dressed?

306
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,904
I was just trying on some
of our new merchandise.

307
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,728
Listen. I don't mean to barge in. But

308
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,639
I found some of those plates with
the cup holders we were talking about.

309
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:25,479
And I figured I'd save you the trip.
I got you a few. And then

310
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,479
I thought we could have some wine.
You know maybe! Like that!

311
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,301
Is that Pinot Grigio?
I'm more of a Chardonnay girl.

312
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,897
Well, that's because
you haven't tried this?

313
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:41,133
Listen, I don't mean to be rude.
But it's just that

314
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:42,778
I have plans.

315
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,882
I'm so sorry. No.
Of course. It's no big deal.

316
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,420
I mean, I totally get it.
Who likes to drop by...

317
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,557
Are you selling guy's stuff now?

318
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,359
I think the U.P.S guy left that.

319
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:59,524
So, the U.P.S guy's name

320
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:00,945
is not only Gary Brooks.

321
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:03,347
His wife had to write his name
inside his collar

322
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,190
'cause he kept losing
it at fantasy baseball camp!

323
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:08,822
Allison, look...

324
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:11,470
I know you're in here, Gary.
Get out here, right now!

325
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:21,891
Oh, my God.

326
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,687
I can never unsee that.

327
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,579
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

328
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:35,331
- Unbelievable.
- It was either this or the bustier.

329
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,519
And I thought it made
me look too chesty.

330
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,841
- It's not funny. You're a Jerk.
- Come on, Allison. It's not my fault!

331
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,433
How could you do this to me?
You know how I felt about her.

332
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:44,824
She came onto me!

333
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:46,229
Really?

334
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:51,332
It's so hard to believe that a sexy
woman would find all this attractive?

335
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,933
Look, I'm a man, Allison.

336
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:58,162
Men have needs! And sometimes,
men, we think with our needs.

337
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,591
How am I supposed to
hang out with her now?

338
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:03,176
I mean, it's like you saw
something that I wanted.

339
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,957
And you just didn't want me to have it.

340
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,639
She doesn't want to hang out with you,
She thinks you're pushy,

341
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,241
bossy, and controlling.

342
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,483
I don't believe that. Sophia,
get out here! I want to talk to you!

343
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:16,335
No thank you!

344
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,264
She doesn't want to
be your friend. Sorry.

345
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:28,260
Well, you know, that's too bad.
I'm just gonna go home.

346
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,065
Allison, wait.
Just wait.

347
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,916
Would you unhook me?
I can't breathe in this thing.

348
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,203
What you doing?

349
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,373
Reading "sense and sensibility."

350
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,655
It's actually kind of
funny when you drink.

351
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,796
I'm sorry. Can we just
do the whole it-was-all-my-fault

352
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,298
- speech and just be done with it?
- Look, Gary.

353
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,756
You did everything right.

354
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,562
I'm sorry.
I think I misheard you. What?

355
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,123
You didn't do anything wrong.

356
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:02,141
Have you snapped? Where are the kids?
Are the kids safe?

357
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:05,983
Gary, look I...
I asked you to introduce me to Sophia.

358
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:09,809
And you did. I mean,
I blew it by coming on too strong.

359
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,900
OK. So you're not blaming
me for any of this?

360
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,334
Well, maybe just the negligee.

361
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,814
I mean, you looked like Janet Reno.

362
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,735
Actually, I wanted to thank you.

363
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:26,370
You want to thank me? OK, seriously,
where are kids? Tom! Louise!

364
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,153
Look, I was looking for a friend.
And I found one.

365
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:37,571
- Sophia doesn't want to be your friend.
- I'm not talking about her.

366
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:39,451
I'm talking about you.

367
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,980
You told me things
that I needed to hear.

368
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:45,753
And only a real friend
would have the guts

369
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,453
to do that. So, thank you.

370
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,312
I've always been your friend, Allison.

371
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,974
- I got something for ya.
- My grill. That's right.

372
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:58,260
Let me get curtis over here, because I'm
gonna need help putting it in my van.

373
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:01,726
I wore this when I was pregnant...

374
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:05,460
With Tom.
And I thought it was your color.

375
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:11,464
You laugh. But if you think I'm not
mowing the lawn in this, you're crazy.

376
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:15,796
And also your "BJ and the bear" box set.

377
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:19,506
BJ and the bear!

378
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:23,190
This is great.
I'm bringing BJ to sausage-fest

379
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,182
we gotta change the name.

380
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:35,484
- Hey, honey. How's it going?
- I went to the movies with Kenny.

381
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:38,819
- And it was so great.
- It must have been. Look at that smile.

382
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:40,820
But you know what?
I don't want to know.

383
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,677
I know. But
can I tell you a little?

384
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:45,744
Of course.

385
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:47,433
Kenny held my hand in the movie.

386
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,497
Ani had such butterflies
I couldn't even eat my milk duds.

387
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,620
Sweetie, that's great.

388
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,339
I have no problem with that.

389
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,443
But just so you know, every time
you hold ands with a little boy,

390
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,084
a panda cries.

391
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,869
