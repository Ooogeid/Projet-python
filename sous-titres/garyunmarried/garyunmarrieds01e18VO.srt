1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,792
All right. No big deal.
Minor setback.

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:11,947
Easy spare, Gary.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,051
Yeah, man. Pick this one up
and we're in the finals.

4
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,819
- That's right.
- How long has my name been on my shirt?

5
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,187
All year, dad. Everyone's name
is on the shirt. We're a team, OK?

6
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:24,507
Except yours is the only shirt
with your address and instructions

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,483
for a cab driver pinned
inside your collar.

8
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:36,098
- The championships.
- Way to go, dad.

9
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:38,586
Thanks, son.
You know, it just goes to show you,

10
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:40,600
you can do anything when
you put your mind to it.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,084
Doesn't hurt that two of the other guys
on the other team got food poisoning.

12
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:46,768
Look, Louise,
they ordered sushi in a bowling alley.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,797
They got what they deserved, OK?

14
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,851
Hey, dad,
why are those 4 guys staring at you?

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,318
The Kim brothers,
from Kim brothers flooring.

16
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,387
They won the championship
the last 4 years.

17
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:57,147
What did you do to them?

18
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:59,391
'cause they're looking
at you like mom does.

19
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,728
They're floor guys, Tom.
Floor guys hate painters.

20
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,754
Painters hate floor guys.

21
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:07,571
Why do we hate them?

22
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,310
Because they scuff
perfectly painted baseboards

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,389
with their buffers.

24
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,949
Painters have no respect for floors.

25
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,887
They leave splatters everywhere.

26
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,695
Man, I wish we were
playing them in the finals.

27
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:30,672
I'd love to kick their asses.

28
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,744
We are playing them in the finals.

29
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:36,511
Well... You know,
there ain't no shame in second place.

30
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:40,975
What kind of attitude is that, stuart?
Come on. We can beat the Kims.

31
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:44,471
We get that trophy, we can rub
their noses in it for a whole year.

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,727
I mean, what's second place,
dinner at the Rusty Anchor?

33
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:49,408
Rusty Anchor.

34
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,485
You know, you can smell that place
all the way from the freeway.

35
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:55,458
That's how you know it's good fish.

36
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,834
We not playing for that. We're playing
for the trophy. I want the trophy.

37
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,712
I want you guys to want the trophy,

38
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:04,539
and that's what we're gonna get
when we beat the Kims' butts!

39
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,258
Talk big, Brooks.

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,959
We'll see you on saturday.

41
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,914
Yeah, don't worry, Kim. We'll be there.

42
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,005
We're gonna wax the floor with you.

43
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,424
We're gonna paint the walls with you!
Two coats!

44
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:18,511
Yeah, you know you guys are just
describing your jobs, right?

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,027
Hey, son. Do me a favor.
Return my shoes, OK?

46
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:25,662
Goody.
They're still warm and humid.

47
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,203
You dropped your...

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,353
Book.

49
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,366
Thanks. I'm Ella.

50
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:35,824
I'm Tom.
What are you reading?

51
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:37,803
Pre-calc.

52
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,049
I read the sequel, "calc."

53
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,285
You're funny.

54
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:45,385
I got to go return these shoes, OK.

55
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,418
- So... bye.
- All right. Bye.

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,226
Ella, let's go.

60
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,753
Thanks for visiting Dadland.

61
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,696
Welcome back to momtopia,
where the fun never starts.

62
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:14,563
Hey, do they still have that ride at
Dadland where you sit on the couch

63
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:17,151
for 6 hours and watch
your life pass you by?

64
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,293
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I smell like popcorn, beer, and feet.

65
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,995
Wait a min. Gary, did you take
them to the bowling alley again?

66
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,733
It's a family fun center, OK?

67
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,793
And, yes, I did.

68
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,990
Dad's team won, mom.
They're in the championship.

69
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:35,084
- Who you playing?
- Kim brothers flooring.

70
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:36,665
Second place.

71
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,371
We're not getting second place
this year, Allison. We're winning.

72
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:43,032
OK? I don't know if you noticed.,
my team's undefeated.

73
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,668
Yeah, only because you had two forfeits,
Gary, OK?

74
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,929
And just before you played Dave's
Roofing, Dave's mother died.

75
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,599
She was their best bowler.

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,623
And they played their hearts out
in her loving memory, all right?

77
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,340
And we still spanked them.

78
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,875
Well, good luck beating
the Kims without me.

79
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,469
- I was the best bowler on the team.
- That's right, was.

80
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:02,615
You was the best bowler on the team, OK?

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,557
But now I was am the best
bowler on the team, OK?

82
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,742
I'm the best bowler on
the team because I'm free.

83
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,313
At last I don't have you counting my
beer or throwing away my chicken wings

84
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:15,187
or using hand sanitizer on
your bowling ball after every roll.

85
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:19,079
You know, there are more germs on
a bowling ball than a dog's rectum.

86
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,213
Look, I think you have to
find other hobbies aside

87
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,847
from figuring out what has
more germs than a dog's rectum.

88
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,965
You know, as much as it's killing me
not to be spending mondays and thursdays

89
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:31,794
at a bowling alley, wearing
somebody else's shoes Which, again,

90
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:35,106
dog's rectum Good luck
on the championship, Gary.

91
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:38,035
Why don't you just admit it? It's
killing you that you're not on the team

92
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:40,001
when we're in the championships.
Just admit it.

93
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,915
You wish you were back on the team.
Admit it.

94
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:45,252
- I hate that i'm not on the team.
- Just admit it.

95
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,818
I just did.

96
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:51,247
You took all the fun out of that.

97
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:54,031
Look, I liked being on the team, OK?

98
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:56,664
And I was a little hurt you didn't
ask me back, but I'm over it.

99
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:59,020
- All right, good.
- And you know what? I cannot wait

100
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:01,527
until you get your butts
shellacked by the Kim brothers.

101
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:04,301
Not gonna happen, OK?

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,013
Because with a little extra coaching,
my guys are gonna be fine.

103
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,645
But you stink as a coach, Gary.

104
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:12,036
I mean, a little extra's just gonna
make your team a little extra stinky.

105
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm the world's greatest coach. I have
a coffee mug that says that on it.

106
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:20,276
Please. Gary,
I was on your team for 7 years.

107
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,818
Your only motivation technique
includes shots of booze.

108
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:28,377
When your team consists of problem
drinkers, that's very motivating.

109
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,290
We had a good practice,
you guys, OK? But

110
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,801
we got to step it up a notch. We got
to really focus and stay motivated, OK?

111
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,399
Motivated. That means shots.

112
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,459
No, no, no. Dennis, no shots.
Dennis, come on. No booze today.

113
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:46,389
But this is a coaching session.
We always have shots.

114
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:50,472
You created the monster, Gary.
You're gonna have to feed it.

115
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,310
No shots this time, OK?

116
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,161
I really want us to just focus
on the practice we just had.

117
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:58,976
It was pretty good, but we can improve.
For instance, OK, stuart?

118
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,682
You are rushing everything.

119
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:03,370
Well, if I take too long,
Dennis drinks my beer.

120
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,650
- I do not.
- I know you do, Dennis.

121
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,745
You're the only one
that wears lip gloss.

122
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:13,032
It is lip balm,
and it's very dry in here.

123
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,907
Guys, come on. Just, Now can you
knock it off? Sit down. Relax.

124
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,141
We gotta bring our "A" game to beat
the Kim brothers. Look at them in there

125
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:23,040
They're so precise. They never
take heir eyes off their pins.

126
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,424
Now's your chance, Dennis.
Go drink their beer.

127
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,407
I don't do that.

128
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:43,454
That's not meant to rush you.

129
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,885
I just want to make sure
I hold my place in line.

130
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:48,605
You know what? You have Skinny arms.

131
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:51,387
If you really want that elephant, you
could just reach up there and grab it.

132
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,150
I'll keep a lookout if you want.

133
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:57,821
You're so sweet, tom,
but we shouldn't be seen together.

134
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,387
Well, why not?

135
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,629
I mean, I made you laugh the other day,
remember, the whole "calc" bit?

136
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:05,824
I remember, and it was funny.

137
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:09,932
Adam-Sandler funny, but let's be honest.

138
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,968
My people hate your people.

139
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:16,347
You're talking about painters
and floorers, not, like,

140
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:18,603
Koreans and whatever I am, right?

141
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:21,876
You're cute, but I better go.

142
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:24,033
My dad would kill me
if he saw us together.

143
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,178
No. Don't follow.
It's way too dangerous.

144
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:31,734
But I have to.
My nachos are up.

145
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,483
OK, look, there's something I want to
try to really harness our attention.

146
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,134
I got just the thing for that.

147
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:42,375
Whoever's driving only gets half.

148
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,851
Dad, that's No, please. Dad?

149
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:49,205
Come on. This is different.
Mine involves visualization.

150
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,773
Well, my thing has that.

151
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:55,727
Dad? Can we try mine first, please?

152
00:07:56,922 --> 00:08:00,041
Now, we're gonna visualize.
Everybody close your eyes.

153
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,097
It's the final frame
of the championships.

154
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,116
There we are, playing for that big,
beautiful trophy.

155
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,401
I'm up, last frame.
I roll the ball.

156
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,518
- It's a strike!
- Way to go, Gar.

157
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,726
Excellent.

158
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:15,540
Anybody else see the naked Indian?

159
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:24,002
No, dad. Just relax, OK?
Everybody keep your eyes closed.

160
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,636
Dennis, you're up.
Your turn to bowl, my friend.

161
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,597
All right, it's my turn
and I've gotand my ball

162
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:35,564
I'm ready to roll.
Then I hear stuart's nose whistle.

163
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,125
- What?
- Your nose whistles, man.

164
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,807
- My nose does not whistle!
- It always whistles, all right?

165
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,650
Every time you sneeze, kids all
over the city get out of the pool.

166
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,730
Yeah, well, you know what I visualize?

167
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,782
Dennis' stupid orange gloves.

168
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,351
This is my look, all right?

169
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:55,433
This is what I am
known for in the lanes.

170
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:58,641
Dude, you're known for
drinking other people's beer.

171
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,040
And wearing lipstick.

172
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:05,867
It's a balm, all right?
And you know what I see?

173
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,611
You standing over the hand dryer
and having it blow up your shorts.

174
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,660
Nobody pays any attention to that.

175
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:17,013
Nobody noticed the old, smiling
hippie straddling the ball return.

176
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:19,020
All right, all right. Come on.

177
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,384
Can we please just concentrate?
I'm trying to get us ready for the Kims.

178
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,104
On the count of 3, everybody just
take a deep breath and relax. 1, 2, 3.

179
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,425
Did you hear it?

180
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:31,781
- I definitely heard that.
- I heard that.

181
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:35,057
Sounds like the 7 dwarfs
are going to work.

182
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,599
Well, you know, don't make fun of stuart
because if there's a massive earthquake

183
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,850
and we're all covered in rubble,
it's that nose whistle

184
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,927
that's gonna lead the rescue dogs to us.

185
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:48,539
You guys knew I had sinus issues
when you asked me to join the team!

186
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,534
This isn't fun anymore.
I quit.

187
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,449
Stuart, what are you doing?
We're just kidding around!

188
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,542
You can't quit!
I need 4 people to fill out a team.

189
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:58,834
Sorry, Gary.
I'm hanging up my shoes.

190
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,511
I can eat at the Rusty Anchor
anytime I want!

191
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,858
That's not what we're playing for!

192
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,325
- Well, it's over.
- No, no, no. - I want that trophy.

193
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:11,454
I just got to figure out somebody
else to put on the team

194
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,930
- in his place, that's all.
- What about Allison?

195
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,823
Dad, the only time I ever
want to hear that sentence

196
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,283
is if we're on a life raft
and someone has to go.

197
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,785
We got to get her or we got to forfeit.

198
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,528
No. We're gonna get that trophy somehow.

199
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:28,866
Hey, Brooks,
I just called the Rusty Anchor

200
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,404
and made your team
a reservation for saturday night.

201
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,738
It's not what we're playing for.
Hey, don't worry, OK, Kim?

202
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,166
Cause we're gonna be there saturday
night. We're gonna beat you.

203
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,824
- Not with 3 players, you're not.
- Don't worry.

204
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,771
I got a fourth player,
and you better brace yourself,

205
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:47,790
'cause I'm unleashing
hell itself on you.

206
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:52,001
- How is Allison?
- She's good. I'll tell her you asked.

207
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:08,166
I can't believe it.
What are you doing here?

208
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:09,768
I wanted to see you.

209
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:15,669
I don't normally wear pajamas to bed.

210
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,485
Listen, I'm sorry for
running out of the arcade,

211
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,457
but I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you,

212
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:24,333
and I wanted to make sure you're going
to the bowling alley on saturday.

213
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:28,141
Yeah. I'll be there.
What about your dad?

214
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:31,598
I don't care what he thinks.
I just want us to hang out.

215
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,345
You want to come in for a second?

216
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,020
I have to be home
before it gets dark out.

217
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:45,804
Yeah, I got to hit
the rack pretty early, too.

218
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:48,234
I'm meeting with a marine
recruiter in the morning.

219
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:52,268
What is that, your Tv? Turn it off!
It's an hour past your bedtime!

220
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,777
- Good morning.
- It was.

221
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:14,361
Somebody woke up on the funny
side of the bed this morning.

222
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
Here, look. I got you a breakfast
sandwich. That's for you.

223
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,279
Gary, what do you want?

224
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,463
Nothing. I you know, I was thinking bout

225
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:25,433
what you said the other day bout wanting
to be back on the bowling team.

226
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,919
I said I was hurt. I never said
I wanted to be back on the team.

227
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,586
You're too proud to really admit
it, but I'm gonna make it easy for you.

228
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,518
I've decided to allow you
back onto the bowling team.

229
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,102
Why? What happened?

230
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:38,308
I just knew how much it
meant to you to be on the team.

231
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:40,943
And now that we're playing
the kim brothers in the finals,

232
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:43,016
we can win the championship,
get that big trophy.

233
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:44,917
I'm gonna let you be a part of that.

234
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:46,610
You are welcome.

235
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,028
Well, forget it, Gary. It's too late.

236
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,324
Yo don't want me before.
Why would I do that now?

237
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:55,120
But, look, OK. I'm gonna be
brutally honest with you here.

238
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,699
And this,
this doesn't leave this house, OK?

239
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,428
the team's not gelling like it used to,

240
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:04,521
and I'm thinking about cutting somebody
loose. I'm leaning towards Stuart.

241
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,462
Stuart? Really?
I think Dennis is the weak link here.

242
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:09,824
- No I think I'm gonna cut loose stuart.
- What about Jack?

243
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:13,167
- I mean It's gonna be Stuart, OK?
- OK, you know what, Gary?

244
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:15,376
You said you were having
a lot more fun without me,

245
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:17,310
you know, so I don't want
to ruin that for you.

246
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,773
We had a lot of fun when you and I were
on the same team. We had loads of fun.

247
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,838
Gary, all we ever did was fight.

248
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,942
Fight? That was just
harmless sports banter.

249
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,018
"If it wasn't for the kids, I would
leave you" is harmless sports banter?

250
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:34,176
I mean, obviously you've never
spent time in a locker room, but...

251
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:38,521
Look, I need you back on the team, OK?
Just come back on the team.

252
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,749
All right.
I will do it...

253
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:47,040
As long as you admit that I am
a better bowler than you.

254
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,163
It's a team sport, Allison.
It's not about individual achievements.

255
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:54,721
- Say it.
- I'm a better bowler than you.

256
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:59,028
Well, have fun at the Rusty Anchor.
Enjoy the catfish legs.

257
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:02,310
You're a better bowler than me, OK?

258
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,822
Thank you, thank you.
I will be there saturday night,

259
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:07,715
but please, would you get rid of Dennis?
I'd like to finish a beer.

260
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,268
It's gonna be historic!

261
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:44,848
Gosh, the Kims just pulled another
strike. They're like machines.

262
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:46,326
Maybe they are machines.

263
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:49,782
That would make a lot of sense.

264
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,659
Would it, dad, really?

265
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:57,070
Your whole life would just get tied
together if they were machines?

266
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,716
You just sanitized the ball when
you rolled it the last time.

267
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,859
Yeah, well, I don't know what happens
to it once it disappears back there.

268
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:05,375
All right. Here I go.

269
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,458
Would you go, already?! Go!

270
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,708
Gary! This is my process.

271
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:24,627
I can't just pick up a ball,
you know what? This is not my ball.

272
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,622
Have you noticed the score, Bbrooks?

273
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,961
I know painters aren't good at math,
but our score is higher than yours.

274
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,319
You're gonna need a lot more
than the highest score to beat us, Kim.

275
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,768
No, that's pretty much
how it works, Dennis.

276
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,801
I am on fire.

277
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:52,951
I wish you were.

278
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,823
- Are these somebody's?
- Those are mine.

279
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,196
- Why? Why didn't you say something?
- I just said those are mine.

280
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,574
- You threw in the garbage!
- Stop whining. It's your turn.

281
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,895
How am I whining? It's my food.
You threw my...

282
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,486
Gary, can I give you some advice?

283
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,821
Look, I'm just trying to help, OK?

284
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:18,267
We can still win this thing,
but I think you need a lighter ball.

285
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,344
- I don't need a lighter ball.
- You know what?

286
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:22,819
Men lose muscle mass
when they get older.

287
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,436
Stop. Just stop.
I don't need a lighter ball, OK?

288
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,582
Gosh! Look what you made me do now!

289
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,647
You would have more control
with a lighter ball.

290
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,869
I'll rember that the next time
I decide to bludgeon.

291
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,205
You know what, Gary?
You should be thanking me, OK?

292
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,795
I'm the only one that's
keeping us alive here.

293
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,215
I am the best bowler you have.

294
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:45,141
You're right, Allison. Thank you.
Thank you for making me miserable.

295
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:47,045
I can't bowl with you around.
I never could.

296
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:50,925
It's like you get inside my head and you
annoy all the talent out the other side.

297
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:52,995
Why did you want
me back on the team?

298
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,978
- I didn't! Stuart quit!
- Oh, crap.

299
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,219
Game over? 'cause we weren't supposed
to say that until the game's over.

300
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,696
What did you do?
What, did you just lie to me?

301
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:08,225
I wanted that trophy so bad, I thought
I could put up with you one night.

302
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,048
I was wrong.
Counting how many beers I've had,

303
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,090
throwing away my food,
sanitizing your ball,

304
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,903
doing that stupid ickey shuffle
before every time you roll the ball.

305
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:19,558
- I should have just forfeited.
- You know what?

306
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:22,217
- It's not too late.
- Where are you going? What?

307
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:25,266
No, you know what? Why don't you stay?
You're the queen of the lanes tonight.

308
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:28,250
You're the best bowler in the world.
You stay. I'll leave, OK?

309
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,407
But then what would we do
without our brilliant coach?

310
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,393
You'd probably sanitize the whole lanes.
That's what you've been doing all night.

311
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,821
You know what? If you want to
wallow in germs, be my guest.

312
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:38,234
- OK, think I will.
- That's nice.

313
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,176
Dog's rectum.
There it is. Dog's rectum.

314
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:43,561
Man, on attention, bowlers.

315
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:48,319
Would the party responsible for Tom
Brooks please report to the arcade?

316
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,686
The party responsible for Tom Brooks.

317
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,898
- Hey, mom.
- What happened?

318
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,061
I got my hand stuck in the claw machine.

319
00:17:57,194 --> 00:18:00,039
Did you hear my name over
the announcement? It's pretty cool.

320
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:03,049
Why were you trying to steal
something out of the claw machine?

321
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:06,305
It's not stealing, mom. I put all my
money in it just for that red Teddy bear

322
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,068
but the claw wouldn't drop it.

323
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:11,483
What happened to you, Brooks?
What, are you bowling or forfeiting?

324
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:14,770
I'm dealing with my kid right now.
Why don't you leave me alone, all right?

325
00:18:15,273 --> 00:18:17,914
This is your son?
Why am I not surprised?

326
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:19,435
What do you mean by that?

327
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,864
He's confused by
a machine with one button.

328
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:25,342
Don't make fun of him.
He was doing it for me.

329
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,503
- I like him, daddy.
- You're seeing bobby Kim's daughter?

330
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:35,577
You are not going to go out
with the son of a painter.

331
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:37,671
Excuse me.

332
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:42,058
Are you saying that my son isn't good
enough to go out with your daughter?

333
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:45,694
If you're talking about the kid with
his arm stuck in the machine,

334
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,643
yeah, that's what i'm saying.

335
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:50,304
Let me tell something Kim. You
can make fun of me and you can make fun

336
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:52,872
of my bowling team, my friends.
You can make fun of her all you want.

337
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,932
That's good. But listen,
when it comes to my kids, back off.

338
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,112
Yeah, that's right.

339
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:01,706
Our son is a bright young man who any
girl would be lucky to go out with.

340
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,078
Thanks, mom.

341
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,145
Is it loosening up at all?
Because my point would have

342
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,896
a better impact if you
weren't stuck in a prize slot.

343
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,505
Just tell your son to stay
away from my daughter.

344
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,938
You know what, Allison?
Maybe we should put our fighting aside

345
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:16,683
to take care of Kim brothers flooring.

346
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,192
Yeah, absolutely.

347
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,640
But then we're gonna pick up
right where we left off, right?

348
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:21,892
Definitely.

349
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:24,135
What do you say, Kim?

350
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:27,283
Let's get back out there
and settle this with our balls.

351
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,481
You know what he meant.

352
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,139
You don't put live animals in here,
do you?

353
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,833
Something's licking my finger.

354
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,687
Getting the feeling back
in your hand yet, son?

355
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:55,685
Yeah, my hand's still pretty sore.

356
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,419
You know, that's the last time
I do anything stupid for a girl.

357
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:02,297
Well, after your next 8 or 9
stupid things that you do,

358
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:04,491
you won't even bother
saying that anymore.

359
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:07,745
Ella was really sweet, Tom.

360
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,871
You should have told
us you were seeing her.

361
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,771
Yeah, that's probably over.

362
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,338
You didn't see the look on her face
when the maintenance guy

363
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:16,697
had to hold up a towel
so I could pee in a bottle.

364
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,910
You bowled a heck of a game, Allison.

365
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:25,611
- Thank you.
- Listen...

366
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:28,328
I still only have 3 people on my team,

367
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:30,377
and there's going to be
a new league starting off.

368
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,409
- Would you...
- No I'm not bowling on your team.

369
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:33,738
Thank god.

370
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,361
I can't believe we left with
this lovely little piece of hardware.

371
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,068
It is beautiful.

372
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:50,404
Yeah, no one expected us
to walk away with that.

373
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:53,712
Yeah, that's what the Kims get
for leaving their van door open.

374
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,456
