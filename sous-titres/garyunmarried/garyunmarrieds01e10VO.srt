1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,814
Hey. Hi, Allison. I'm here for the kids.

2
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:11,966
- What. What is that?
- 24,000 nickels.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,054
What?

4
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:16,571
I stopped at an Indian casino
on the way home from work last night.

5
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:18,496
- And I hit a jackpot.
- Well...

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,553
Congratulations.
Now get them out of my sink.

7
00:00:21,678 --> 00:00:23,555
No. This is your alimony payment.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,911
To the nickel, and it's early.
You're welcome.

9
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:28,231
- Kids, daddy's here! Let's go!
- Wait a minute.

10
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:31,714
You expect me to accept
my spousal support in nickels?

11
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:35,556
Yeah. I mean, you could take
it back to the casino and ask for Bills.

12
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,203
Why wouldn't you do
that when you were there?

13
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:41,481
Cause Bills are light and they bend.
And nickels are heavy and hilarious.

14
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,544
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, sweetie. Wide load.

15
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,328
I'm so glad you talked
me out of playing the flute, mom.

16
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:52,539
Louise, honey, you will thank
me for introducing you to the cello.

17
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:53,600
Here you go.

18
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:56,864
Well, if I ever need to
dispose of a body, I'll be ready.

19
00:00:58,247 --> 00:00:59,567
I'll be out in a minute, guys.

20
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,212
You think maybe I can
drive the car to school?

21
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,680
I've seen you play Grand Theft Auto.
And until you can operate a vehicle

22
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:09,754
without jumping the curb and killing
a pimp, I have to say "no."

23
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:15,249
Can I have the kids next thursday?
I need to know right now. 12 seconds.

24
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:16,582
Thurs... well thursday...

25
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:18,978
10 seconds, tell me now.
I'll let you have them on wednesday.

26
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:22,356
- You're freaking me out, i'm scared!
- What?! Yes! Yes!

27
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:23,957
OK. OK. Come on.

28
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,950
- What happened?
- Come on. OK. Allison, steady. Steady.

29
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,144
I did it, yeah! I did it!

30
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:36,907
No wonder I could never find your
G-spot. It's in the Palm of your hand.

31
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,379
- What was that all about?
- I was bidding online

32
00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:45,165
for concert tickets for me and the kids.
And I scored.

33
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:48,194
- You're taking them to a concert?
- Yeah. Michael Bolton.

34
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:52,435
Michael Bolton?!
I knew it. I knew it. You hate the kids.

35
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:55,003
It's 'cause they ruined your body,
isn't it?

36
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,162
I knew you were going to have
a problem with this.

37
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:01,412
I have a problem with it. Their first
concert shouldn't be Michael Bolton.

38
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,235
I'm sure Michael Bolton's a nice guy

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,743
and from outerspace looks like
a human being of sorts.

40
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:07,629
But come on, I mean, if I knew

41
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,459
that's why you wanted to switch days,
I wouldn't have agreed to it.

42
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,836
Why shouldn't this be their first
concert? I mean, I love Michael Bolton.

43
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:17,218
Remember? I played a CD in the delivery
room when I gave Birth to Louise.

44
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:20,826
That's why they had to put a suction cup
on her head and pull her out of you.

45
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,164
Well, Gary, it's too late.

46
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:28,003
Our divorce agreement states that once
we agree to switch nights, it's final.

47
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,512
Isn't there also a stipulation
in the divorce agreement

48
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:33,419
that we can switch back in the event
of a Michael Bolton concert?

49
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:36,973
I can't deal with this. OK? You told me
I could have the kids. That's it.

50
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:39,483
I'm taking them to the concert.
Discussion over.

51
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:45,856
Look who it is. It's Lance Armstrong's
great-great-grand father.

52
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,958
You ready for our bike ride?

53
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,447
Yeah. As soon as I get
Gary out of here. Come on.

54
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,716
Shall I throw his favorite ball
out the door

55
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,865
and close it after he gives chase?

56
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:58,914
You know what Krandall?
Here. Have some nickels.

57
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,880
I bet nickels were popular
when you were a lad. You can go...

58
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:07,463
Go to a picture show.
Get yourself some bread.

59
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,722
Maybe buy war bonds
for the boys overseas.

60
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,923
Over there, over there

61
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,052
those are way too tight, Krandall.

62
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,477

Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]

65
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,294
Michael Bolton? I mean, come on.

66
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:28,280
Michael Bolton?!
It's gonna smell like a rock concert.

67
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:31,027
It'll look like a rock concert. But
to the people that are actually there,

68
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:33,467
it's gonna be like they're
all stuck in an elevator!

69
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:37,437
Can you please stop gripping
about your concert issues long enough

70
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:40,454
- to make your own pizza.
- All right. What am I supposed to do?

71
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:43,755
Make your own pizza.
It's Kinda self-explanatory.

72
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,170
So, what's the big deal with
the Michael Bolton thing anyway?

73
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:49,315
I'll tell you what the big deal is.
It's a big moment your first concert.

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,482
Tell me what your first concert was.
Don't even think about it. Just say it.

75
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,592
OK. 1995. Willtern Theater.

76
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:58,173
I saw REM, radio head, and a very
angry look on my mother's face

77
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:00,248
when I snuck into the house
at 4:00 morning.

78
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,075
See that. Yeah! Now, that's a concert.
That's a big moment in her life.

79
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,953
- What was your first concert, Dennis?
- Van Halen.

80
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,078
- Roth or Hagar?
- David Lee, man.

81
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:13,919
Front row.
Diamond Dave jumped into the crowd

82
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,985
and Broke my right arm.

83
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:18,631
Heh. Look.
It's still shorter than the other one.

84
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,202
See that's what's important
about a first concert.

85
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,337
It's gotta be a big, great memory.
You know?

86
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:26,589
Ask me what my first concert was?

87
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,515
- OK. What was your.
- Scott Baio.

88
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,549
- Who?
- Scott Baio.

89
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:33,313
- From Happy Days?
- Scott Baio from Happy Days.

90
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:34,988
It's a little known fact.

91
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:38,390
Fonzy's little cousin cut
a couple of albums back in 1982.

92
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:41,763
And my cousin Gwen dragged
me to his boys night out concert.

93
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,489
And she bought me a Tank top

94
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:46,276
with Scott Baio's face on it.
And my mother made me wear

95
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:49,078
it to school the next day
so I wouldn't hurt Gwen's Feelings.

96
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,871
- That is awful.
- On picture day.

97
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,972
I can't believe i'm even
friends with you, man.

98
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,204
Dude, I can't believe I slept with you.

99
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,553
Why does Allison get to
take them to their first concert?

100
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:08,472
Well, why don't you just find
another concert to take them to first?

101
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:10,561
Bruce Springsteen's playing
at the forum next week.

102
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,208
Really? That's great idea that

103
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,707
30,000 other people
had the minute they announced it.

104
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:17,982
Well, smarty pants, they always release
a handful of tickets before the show.

105
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:20,122
- Really?
- Yeah. Comps that cancel or

106
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:22,361
extra seats that open up.
It happens all the time.

107
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:25,195
You just gotta get in line early because
every scalper in town will be there.

108
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,096
Oh, my gosh!
That's fantastic.

109
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:31,079
Can you imagine Tom and Louise's
first concert Being Springsteen?

110
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:34,515
That be amazing. I mean it's not as cool
as David Lee roth smashing your arm.

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,334
But it's still pretty good.

112
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,289
It's a good 4 inches.

113
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:42,301
You know when I swim,
I just go in circles.

114
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,345
Louise, sweetheart, come on.
I promised your mom that you would

115
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,039
practice your cello tonight.
You have to practice.

116
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:58,323
But dad it's embarrassing.
People think i'm a street performer.

117
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,252
They keep trying to hand me money.

118
00:06:00,377 --> 00:06:02,787
That's good. If we get enough money,
we can probably park

119
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,957
on someone's Lawn outside
the stadium. Come on.

120
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,984
Hey, I'm doing long division.
How about a little love for me!

121
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:19,023
Hey, Tommy, why don't you take
your sister to go get a soda. OK?

122
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,825
- Good evening.
- Howdy do.

123
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,995
- Big Springsteen fan?
- Yes, I am.

124
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:35,092
You know I hope you're not standing
in line for a ticket scalper, ma'am.

125
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:36,511
Because that is illegal.

126
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:39,951
No. I'm just a Springsteen fan like you.

127
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:42,868
Sure.

128
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:47,000
What's track 5 on side 1 of born to run?

129
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,470
There is no track 5.

130
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,276
That's an exceptional guess.

131
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,746
Excuse me. Gary! Gary!
What the hell?!

132
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,608
I just gave a street kid a dollar
because he looked like Tom,

133
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,592
and then I realized he was Tom!

134
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,343
Why am I picking up
my kids on Hollywood Boulevard?

135
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,052
It's kind of an emergency Allison.

136
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,302
See, that ticket window
is gonna open in 2 hours.

137
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,521
And I'm getting tickets
to see Springsteen.

138
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,990
So what, you have them here at 8:00
on a school night sitting on a filthy

139
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:20,729
sidewalk like homeless
bum children so you can get tickets?

140
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:24,026
Yeah. They're gonna remember
this night the rest of their lives.

141
00:07:24,217 --> 00:07:26,682
This concert better not be on
the Same night as Michael Bolton.

142
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,555
- No. It's the night before.
- Gary, I can't believe you.

143
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:32,911
You just, can't stand it that i'm gonna
take them to their first concert.

144
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,915
So you have to jump in
and take them to a concert

145
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,142
- the day before just to tick me off?
- No. I don't want to tick you off.

146
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:40,434
I don't want their first
concert to be a disaster.

147
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,633
I want it to be a good memory.
It's all about just

148
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:44,295
giving the kids good memories.

149
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,739
I wanted a good memory on our
wedding night, but then I

150
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:50,561
found out about your "if diehard is on,
I have to watch it" policy.

151
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,926
How many times have
we been through this? Mclane

152
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,160
wants to be with his family
on Christmas. But can't

153
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,472
be with his family on Christmas because
he has to save Nakatomi Plaza.

154
00:07:58,597 --> 00:07:59,713
Gary, listen to me.

155
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:02,037
We are going to have
a great time at Michael Bolton.

156
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:04,434
And you not gonna get them on
wednesday night just so you can

157
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:07,347
concert block me, OK?
Even if it is for Bruce.

158
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,651
- God, would you shut up?
- All right, look.

159
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:13,509
This is me and you here. Listen.

160
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:16,872
You have to give me the kids because
you agreed to switch nights. Right?

161
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,660
Our divorce stipulates that once
you agree to switch nights,

162
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,309
- you can't switch back.
- All right, fine, Gary.

163
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,155
But this isn't over. OK?

164
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,130
Kids, come on. Let's get your stuff.
Pack it up. We're leaving.

165
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:30,026
I think this is a new low.
Even for you.

166
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,573
I said "you."

167
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,907
I think I'm gonna be sick.

168
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,562
Sweetie, you saw what
happened to the neighbor's cat?

169
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,843
No. What happened?

170
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,899
He's taking a nap in the road.

171
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,619
He's adorable. He looks very peaceful.

172
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:55,636
And he's got a look on his
face like "mondays are a bummer."

173
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,724
Why are you sick, sweetie?

174
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:01,499
Because mom like Tom drive
the car in the church parking lot.

175
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,489
Wait. Your mother
let Tommy drive the car?

176
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:05,142
Well, if you call it driving.

177
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:08,678
Stop, start. Stop, start.
Stop, start. Barf!

178
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:15,115
- Hey, dad. Mom let me drive the car.
- Yeah, I heard. That's fantastic, man.

179
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,366
Check it out.
I made a right turn so perfectly,

180
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,337
the blinker turned off by itself.

181
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,927
You let Tommy drive the car.
I'm his father. That's a father's job.

182
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:28,192
Fathers have been teaching their
sons to drive for thousands of years.

183
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:32,224
I'm sorry, Gary.
Tom asked if he could give it a shot.

184
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:34,359
And I knew it was
something you'd want to do.

185
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:37,788
But then I rembered,
you stole the first concert from me.

186
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:40,328
And then the next thing I know,
we're driving through hedges

187
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,320
and nuns are giving us the finger. So...

188
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,322
Well, if you're sure
you want to play it that way, Allison,

189
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:49,629
be careful and buckle your seatbelt.
Because I can play that way, too.

190
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:53,999
That reminds me. I took Louise on her
first roller coaster ride yesterday.

191
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:57,703
- You didn't.
- Yeah. She's finally this tall.

192
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:05,445
- Tom, could I see you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

193
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,295
Louise, I got you a present.
It's on your bed. I got it at the store.

194
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,871
- Thanks, dad.
- You got it.

195
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,611
What's going on?

196
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:14,865
Well, Tommy,
your dad's gonna teach you how to shave.

197
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:19,524
There were are.

198
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:22,838
- Shave what?
- Shave your.

199
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:27,543
Your beard you big
hairy lumber Jack. Come on!

200
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:33,169
- What's with the first aid kit?
- Why don't we answer that question

201
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:36,903
if and when we need it? OK, son.
This is shaving cream.

202
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,576
I know what shaving cream is, dad.

203
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,613
OK. Good. There you go.
Lather some of that on there.

204
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,142
All right.

205
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,815
There you go.
Go ahead.

206
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,271
Use the mirror, son. Use the mirror.

207
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:53,360
It doesn't bother you that
I don't have any hair on my face?

208
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:55,600
No, listen, you're a brooks.

209
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:58,868
You come from a long line
of incredibly hairy people.

210
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,075
All right?
Remember your aunt rose?

211
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,785
Who do you think taught me how to shave?

212
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,316
Now, son, a man
is only as good as his tools.

213
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:10,076
Make sure you use a razor

214
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:13,278
made by a company that also
makes ball-point pens.

215
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,568
These are excellent because
they're hollow inside.

216
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:20,060
And if you cut yourself and
bleed to death, you can call for help.

217
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:24,825
Have at it.

218
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:28,637
Have at it. Go ahead. Go ahead.
There you go. You having fun?

219
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,496
- Yeah.
- Good. That's good.

220
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:33,327
Because from here on out,
it's a giant pain in the ass.

221
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:38,071
- So why did we have to do this today?
- It's all about milestones, son.

222
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,529
Fathers and sons doing
things for the first time.

223
00:11:40,654 --> 00:11:43,724
My father didn't get to teach me.
He's still mad at my aunt Rose.

224
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:47,038
You've got to be kidding me.

225
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,067
It's your first brassiere, honey.
Congratulations.

226
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,231
Thanks, dad. But I really
don't need this kind of pressure.

227
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,967
I have surprise for you guys. How would
you like to go to burgeroo's for dinner?

228
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,646
I called your mom, she said it was fine.

229
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,267
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.

230
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:15,278
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking pictures of you guys.

231
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,622
Look. You are so adorable.

232
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:19,885
Scotty, move closer. Don't be shy.

233
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,818
Your dad, he should be seeing this?

234
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:27,379
Do you guys always do this
before you go to Burgeroo's?

235
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:29,985
We going to Burgeroo's?

236
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:31,967
Not you, Tom.

237
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,547
Louise and Scotty are
going on their first date.

238
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,672
What?!

239
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,642
It's not really a date.

240
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:43,978
But you guys go wait in the car, OK.
I will be out in a minute.

241
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,937
I have to talk to Tommy about something.

242
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,112
What's going on here?
Why can't I go to Burgeroo's?

243
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:52,183
Well, your sister is going on a date.
Which brings me to something very

244
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:55,591
important that I'd like to discuss with
you. But I don't have a lot of time, so

245
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:57,952
listen carefully. OK. Here we go.

246
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:03,123
Tommy, when a man and
a women love each other very much.

247
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,210
I've already had this talk with dad.

248
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:10,503
Drugs.

249
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:13,768
- Someone offers you drugs...
- I've had this one, too.

250
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,139
Fine.

251
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,937
The game is called Blackjack.

252
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:27,342
Cured.

253
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:31,092
Cured.

254
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:37,897
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Krandall. But
there's a Lewis and Tom here to see you.

255
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,813
- Lewis and Tom?
- Louise. My name is Louise.

256
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:45,267
- Do I even look like a Lewis?
- Yeah. That's fine. Let them in, ellen.

257
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,339
This is a surprise.

258
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,580
- Hey, Dr. K.
- Is everything all right?

259
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:54,957
Not really. We need to talk to you.

260
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:57,405
Please, sit down. How did you get here?

261
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,606
We took public transportation.
And if the rest of the world did too.

262
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,353
Louise, one problem at a time. OK?

263
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:07,155
Things are getting a little
out of hand with mom and dad.

264
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,991
Why don't you tell me what's going on.

265
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,709
Well, dad took us
to Mexico the other day.

266
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,095
- That sounds nice.
- For dinner.

267
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,154
It was 6 hours in the car
and 10 minutes at a Taco stand.

268
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:20,779
Why would he do that?

269
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:23,494
So he could be with us
our first time out of the country.

270
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:26,614
OK. That sounds a bit extreme.

271
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,344
No. Extreme was mom taking
me on a college tour to cal State.

272
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:32,953
OK, that's crazy.

273
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:36,261
Of course it is.
Me, at a state school? Please...

274
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,591
What are you doing here?

275
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,736
The kids called and they told me
to come over.

276
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:45,653
They called me too.
Why are you on the porch?

277
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,966
The door's locked.
It's, like, bolted from the inside.

278
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:49,511
That's what you think scientist?

279
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:52,842
From the inside? As opposed to outside?
I used to have deadbolt on the outside,

280
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,035
but I got tired of my neighbors
locking me in my house!

281
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,701
- Is this important?
- Hey, all right. Let's go.

282
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:01,118
Tommy? Louise? Let's go!
What's going on in there, you guys?

283
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:05,277
Walter, what are you doing here?

284
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,304
Tom and Louise came by my office today,

285
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,610
told me about the little competion
you two have been engaged in.

286
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:13,555
Hey, what are they doing over there?
Is that a paper shredder?

287
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,802
- Are those my tickets?
- That's right, Gary.

288
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,582
3 Springsteen tickets,
3 Michael Bolton tickets.

289
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:22,042
Louise, honey, I love you so much.

290
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,982
Sweetie, don't let the bolton tickets
touch the Springsteen tickets. OK?

291
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:30,522
You have bigger issues, Gary.
Your children are very unhappy with you.

292
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:32,547
Walter, would you please let us in?

293
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,727
That was just the receipt.
Now do I have your undivided attention?

294
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:40,125
Yeah. Yes, you do.

295
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,425
If I let you in, will you
listen to what your kids have to say

296
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:45,854
and not make a grab
for the remaing tickets?

297
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,613
- Yes. We will.
- I promise. Yes.

298
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:51,257
- All right. All right.
- All right.

299
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:54,047
OK. We're good.
It's cool. It's OK. It's OK.

300
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,523
Why are you hands in the air?
It's not a stick-up.

301
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,245
- Sorry. I don't know.
- No. No. Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

302
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:03,416
You got it. You got it, Tommy.
You're the man. You're the man.

303
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:07,785
All right guys, let's not do anything
crazy. OK? Tom, Louise. Nothing crazy.

304
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,466
Crazy? Like buying your 11-year-old
a giant cafeteria Lady Bra?

305
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:17,641
- Seriously? You did that?
- I figured she'd grow into it.

306
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,442
What makes you think...

307
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:21,866
No. No. Back! Back!

308
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,481
Sorry. My mistake.
Was that Springsteen or Bolton?

309
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,802
What part of tickets
and shredder don't understand?

310
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:31,857
- Oh, my god.
- I'm sorry, Louise. We're sitting down,

311
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:34,045
we're listening to you now.
OK. Go ahead.

312
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,700
Why don't you begin.

313
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:40,636
Well, we want you to stop forcing us to
do stuff that we're not ready to do yet.

314
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:44,438
- Like shaving and dating.
- And driving.

315
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,216
Actually the driving I liked.
I'd like to see more of that.

316
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:51,526
- But everything else has to stop.
- Gary, Allison.

317
00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:54,762
I think your children deserve
an explanation for your behavior.

318
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,217
Look, when your dad and I were married,

319
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:01,185
we were together and we saw all
those first things,

320
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,647
you know, together.
The walking and then the talking.

321
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:07,684
Riding your bike. Losing a tooth.
Getting a ride in an ambulance.

322
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,349
Tommy, that all happened
for you in one afternoon.

323
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,576
I guess we're just afraid
that we're gonna

324
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,349
- Miss out on those things, you know?
- But they are going to happen.

325
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:22,934
And we need to know how you plan
to handle them now that you're divorced.

326
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,989
Pop quiz my first homecoming
dance what are you going to do?

327
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,891
Hey, that's mine.
Hey! Wait! Wait! No!

328
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,207
I'm gonna call your father.
Invite him over and include him.

329
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:38,526
And we'll show him the dress.

330
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,746
- Good?
- I'll take pictures.

331
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,667
And I'll give your mom
doubles of those pictures.

332
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,183
And I'll take your date in the backyard,

333
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,974
and I'll show him how quickly
I can dig a shallow grave.

334
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:51,119
Good answer.

335
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,709
But of course, I'll never participate
in such an outdated sexist ritual.

336
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,853
Though, if I do,
I want to look really pretty.

337
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:04,456
We want to do things together with
you guys. We do. And we're gonna try.

338
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,404
And whoever isn't there, we'll make
sure that person is there in spirit. OK?

339
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,063
- What?!
- What? What was that?

340
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,875
I don't know.
I'm drunk with power.

341
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,390
Give me some of these.
You're hogging them all. Let me do some.

342
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:21,547
Hey! Tommy, stop!

343
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,027
Enough. I'm your father.
I'm saying this has to end.

344
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:27,873
Give me the tickets.

345
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,210
What the heck are these?

346
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,822
The freudian pips?

347
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:40,237
They're left over from a little gig
I had with 3 of my psychiatrist friends.

348
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:44,857
We were sort of an up with
people for the clinically depressed.

349
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,375
You're a strange man, Krandall.

350
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:51,253
Give me my tickets.

351
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:53,640
All right.
Sorry I had to put you through that.

352
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,347
- But it certainly was effective.
- Yeah. OK. Here.

353
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:58,552
Hi, Bruce Springsteen tickets.

354
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,000
This is fantastic. This is really great.

355
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,334
You guys gonna have the greatest time
of you life when you go to this concert.

356
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,148
With your mom.

357
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,523
What? I thought you were taking us.

358
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,539
I was gonna. But she's right, Tommy.

359
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:17,554
It was her idea to take
you guys to your first concert.

360
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,329
And I just wanted to steal it from her.
And that's not right.

361
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:23,682
So your mom should take you.
That is, if you do want to go see Bruce.

362
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:27,000
What? Are you kidding me? Bruce!
Come on guys, we're gonna rock?

363
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,319
Kids, you think we could, I don't know,
buy your dad a Springsteen ticket?

364
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:36,391
Time out.
That's pretty expensive, Allison.

365
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:39,198
I don't know if we can afford it.
You know what we could do.

366
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,087
We could sell those
Michael Bolton tickets.

367
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,619
And with the money we make
we could buy cup of coffee.

368
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:45,809
And then we could drink it
while we're thinking of way

369
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,506
to buy a Springsteen ticket.

370
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:52,090
You know, I think I have enough nickels
in my kitchen to buy you a ticket.

371
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:54,644
All right.

372
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,678
And with the money left over
we can get you a Michael Bolton ticket.

373
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:04,016
Can you see anything?

374
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:07,713
And how many times is this guy
going to ask us if we're ready to rock?

375
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:11,780
Everyone has clearly said that they're
ready to rock. What more does he want?

376
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,677
I can't believe we have to
go to another one of these tomorrow.

377
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:18,882
Are we even facing the right way?

378
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,946
- I wish we could go home.
- Don't ruin it for them.

379
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,715
These memories will last
them the rest of their lives.
