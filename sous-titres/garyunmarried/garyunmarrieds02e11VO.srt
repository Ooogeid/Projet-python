1
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:05,367
Hey, allison. Here's the
rest of the kids' stuff.

2
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:06,702
Thanks for watching 'em tonight

3
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:10,106
While curtis and I go out
and celebrate my new raise.

4
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:14,372
Oh. Where you gonna go now
that chippendales closed?

5
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:15,480
Actually we're going to a new place

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,429
Where they have much
smaller banana hammocks.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,071
And...We're done with the bananas. Ok.

8
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:24,251
It's not a problem taking the kids.

9
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:26,131
Howard's coming home from hong kong tonight.

10
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:27,637
So, I'm going to be home anyway.

11
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:30,028
Gotta tell ya, I really miss him
when he's not here, you know.

12
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,744
And I know this is kind of soon,
but I feel like he and I

13
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:34,150
Might just go the distance.

14
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:37,501
Great. As long as that
distance is really far from me.

15
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:38,506
Hi, mom.

16
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:39,843
Oh, hey! Hey kids. You ready for dinner?

17
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:40,847
Yeah.

18
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:42,588
Yeah. I don't really have an appetite.

19
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:44,025
Or a will to live.

20
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:48,371
What's wrong, son? Well,
you know that gir, Mellisa?

21
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:50,010
Well, I thought she was into me.

22
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,853
But then I found out she went to
parabid lake with jerrod pinsky.

23
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:57,032
Jerrod pinsky is gross my friend danielle's
sister sits behind him in history class.

24
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:59,137
She said he gets dandruff all over her desk.

25
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:02,179
Oh, honey, that's not nice to talk
about people behind their back.

26
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,653
Your mom's right, honey.

27
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:05,190
The guy could have, like,
a medical condition or something.

28
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,263
You gotta show people a little compassion.

29
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:11,741
Ok? So, how'd this snowman
freak steal your old lady?

30
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:14,515
You know how I said I could impress melissa
with those shoes that you bought me?

31
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:15,851
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,722
Well, turns out jerrod had
those same exact shoes.

33
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:21,395
And unfortunately, underneath his
shoes was his dad's 20-foot ski boat

34
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,668
That they're going out on this weekend.

35
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,004
Ski boat?!

36
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,975
That's a tough one to beat my man.

37
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:29,145
You could have said, "hey,
my dad's got his own radio show."

38
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:33,555
Or "hey, my dad's got a van
with carpeting on the ceiling."

39
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:36,862
But if you ever need, your dad can
fit 7 hardboiled eggs in his mouth

40
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,635
At the same time. You're golden.

41
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:41,805
Now you remember?! But when I
did it at the cocktail party,

42
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:43,876
You acted like it wasn't happening.

43

44
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,632
[stammering] you think-- you think-
-you think we drank your whole raise yet?

45
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:02,270
You know, I don't like vodka.

46
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,805
I don't like jell-o.

47
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:06,909
You put 'em together and
I can have a whole tray.

48
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,181
Hey, man, you-- you ready for another one?

49
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:12,616
I don't know. Maybe we should--

50
00:02:12,617 --> 00:02:13,885
Maybe we should take a break.

51
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:16,454
We gotta take a break, curtis.

52
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:20,624
We prob--we probably
should just take a break.

53
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,094
Whoo. That's good for you?

54
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:25,361
We proved we could do it.

55
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,596
All right.

56
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:28,731
There you go.

57
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,199
I feel bad for tommy.

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,068
I can't stop thinking about how
he lost a girl that he likes

59
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,036
'cause his dad's some stupid boat guy--

60
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,271
Owns a boat.

61
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:40,107
How much-- how much is a boat cost?

62
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:44,310
A boat costs more than you got.

63
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,913
The only reason that jerrod kid was able
to steal tommy's girlfriend away from him

64
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,281
Is 'cause his dad had a boat.

65
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:52,984
Yep. The kid had an edge.

66
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:54,686
Tired of guys with edges.

67
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,121
You think my dad had a
boat in the driveway?!

68
00:02:57,122 --> 00:03:00,123
No, I do not.

69
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:03,459
You know what my dad had?
He had an empty oil barrel.

70
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,562
Just rolled it home one day.
Left it in the driveway.

71
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,998
You think that barrel gave me an edge?!

72
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:13,934
No. You did not have an oil barrel edge.

73
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:18,338
I think your edge was, "hey,
my dad always has pot!"

74
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:23,208
Hey, curtis, look at this.

75
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,943
There's a sailboat on ebay.

76
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:27,946
Used 14-foot catalina.
600 bucks. Oh my gosh.

77
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:31,015
You kidding me? What? It's got a
hole in it? Why is it so cheap?

78
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:35,152
Let me see this here.

79
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:36,987
Oh, that--that is nice.

80
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:39,989
Wait a second!

81
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,991
You thinking about buying a boat?!

82
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,793
Maybe I am.

83
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:47,028
Well, how much are you going to bid?

84
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,062
I'm not going to bid anything.

85
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:49,730
I'm just gonna click "buy it now."

86
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:53,833
Hey. Hey. That's a serious move, baby.

87
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,401
I'm a serious man.

88
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,668
Get that boat!

89
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,669
I'm getting the boat.

90
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,937
I press the key, and it's done.

91
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,038
Do it.

92
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,672
I'm gonna do it.

93
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,974
Buy the boat, baby!

94
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:06,010
I bought the boat!

95
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:07,344
Yes! We got a boat!

96
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:08,946
âTª we bought a boat! We bought a boat! âTª

97
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:12,081
âTª we bought a boat! We...
Bought...A boat! âTª

98
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,317
âTª we bought a boat! We bought a boat! âTª

99
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:16,385
âTª we bought a boat âTª

100
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:17,386
No, I bought a boat.

101
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,453
What?!

102
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:20,621
I bought a boat.

103
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:22,222
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:26,258
Hey, remember in high school when we got
pulled over by the cops and you said,

105
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,194
"hey, swallow this or we got a problem."

106
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,765
Well, now we got a boat.

107
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,869
Hey, that sounded like a boat.
Did you guys hear a boat?

108
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,337
That--

109
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:44,638
No, not yet. But, hey,
I got it all lined up with melissa.

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,277
She's totally into me again.
You told her about the boat?

111
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:49,812
Yeah, yeah. I just walked up to her
before school all cool and casual.

112
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:51,914
And I was like, "hey, melissa, 'sup.

113
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,549
"my dad just got this cool boat.

114
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,452
And if you want to go for a ride, whatever."

115
00:04:57,453 --> 00:05:00,621
Get this. She's like, "oh, my god, tommy.
You're so awesome."

116
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:04,758
It's--it's funny how you
remember it that way.

117
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,496
I saw the whole thing.
He chased melissa down the hall

118
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,831
With junk falling out of your backpack.

119
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:13,498
Then one of your shoes flew off,
and you shouted,

120
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:16,568
"my dad got a boat!
And you wanna go on my dad's boat?!"

121
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,573
Well, after we cleared that up...

122
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,542
She said yes. And that's all I care about.

123
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:26,509
[doorbell]

124
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,812
The boat! The boat! The boat!

125
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:33,048
Be cool! Be cool!
Act like you've been there before!

126
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:36,851
Gary brooks?

127
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,087
Yes!

128
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:41,989
Could you sign for a delivery, please?

129
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,826
Oh my gosh. True craft marine. This is it.

130
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:51,063
Here you go.

131
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,401
Have a good one.

132
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:04,475
I don't get it.

133
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:06,343
Well, open it.

134
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:10,746
Maybe the keys are inside
the box for the boat.

135
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:13,782
Hey, if the keys are this big,
the boat's gonna be huge.

136
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,288
Ok. Here we go.

137
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,059
Ok.

138
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:33,732
You know what? This is probably
a model to familiarize yourself

139
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,700
With the real boat when you get it.

140
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:38,436
Yeah. I don't think so, dad.

141
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:41,171
Dad, I hate to tell you.
But this is your boat.

142
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:43,974
You bought a collector's
replica of a 14-foot catalina.

143
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:45,308
What?!

144
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:49,778
That's impossible. I must
have been so drunk--careless.

145
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,080
Hey, dad, what am I
supposed to tell melissa?

146
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:53,248
You tell melissa you got a boat.

147
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,449
We're gonna put that in the harbor.

148
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,617
You just tell her it's really far away.

149
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:01,288
Is the boat here? Where's the boat?

150
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:10,228
Maybe it is so small,
because I am so far away.

151
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,434
Knock it off, curtis.
It's a model. You know it.

152
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:20,304
Wow. Look at the detail.

153
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:23,106
Got little strings for the sails.

154
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:27,276
Little tiny hinges on the hatches there.

155
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,778
Oh, there's a little dude
driving it inside there.

156
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,147
I'm gonna go call melissa and
tell her this whole thing's off.

157
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:35,082
Don't. We'll think of something, you know?

158
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,585
It's--hey, your mom's boyfriend has a boat.

159
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:39,319
What? You're gonna ask needleman?

160
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,654
Yeah. I don't care.

161
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,455
I'll ask someone that makes
me physically sick for a favor

162
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,257
If it involves my kids.

163
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,891
Ok. But you see bronson
pinchot at the shakies,

164
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:49,594
And you can't ask him
for an autograph for me?

165
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,630
The man was in the middle
of a shift, curtis.

166
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,805
Welcome aboard the u.S.S.
"needlefish," gentlemen.

167
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:05,907
Wow, you got a great boat here, needleman.

168
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:08,609
It's a yacht. Whatever. Doesn't matter.

169
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,411
I really appreciate you
letting me use it for tommy.

170
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:13,580
Oh, no problem, buddy. He's a good kid.

171
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:14,847
I'm starting to think of him like a son.

172
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:17,349
Ha. Yeah, don't.

173
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:20,952
Hey, man, is this gps right here?

174
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,420
Yeah. This boat's got everything.

175
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,121
Man, you got everything on this boat.

176
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:27,057
It's a yacht. Whatever. Doesn't matter.

177
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:29,626
Check it out. You got state of
the art navigation right here,

178
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:32,161
24-hour surveillance system right here.

179
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,430
I may have gone a little bit
overboard with the tanning bed,

180
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,433
But some days it gets a little
cloudy out here. So, you know.

181
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:43,537
I'd be happy with a boat that wouldn't
get sunk if it got rammed by a goldfish.

182
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:46,673
You know, guys, it doesn't
matter what you have on your boat

183
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:48,441
As long as you're drawn to the sea.

184
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:51,143
Boat guys are a special breed.
We stick together.

185
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,978
Welcome aboard, hombres.

186
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,480
Now, why don't I take you guys down below.

187
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:56,848
I'll show you how to work the head.

188
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:00,084
I appreciate you letting us use the boat.

189
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:02,720
But I didn't know there
would be strings attached!

190
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:08,592
You know, I really admire
what you're doing for tom.

191
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:12,029
I completely understand how a father
would want his son to have more than him.

192
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,064
Although my son will
never want for anything,

193
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:15,665
So, I can't actually relate to it,

194
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,535
But I do understand it as a concept.

195
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:19,902
[cell phone rings] oh!

196
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:21,737
Excuse me. Yes?

197
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,505
Uh, no.

198
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,007
Yes.

199
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:27,542
Excuse me guys. Excuse me just a second.

200
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,044
Yeah, no problem, man.

201
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,982
Boy, he got squirrelly all of a sudden.

202
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:36,184
Look at this place. Can you imagine
if we had this in high school?

203
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:37,885
This is way better than sideburns.

204
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,958
Man, we'd be getting
chicks port and starboard.

205
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,093
What's this button even do?

206
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:47,495
[soft piano music plays]

207
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:49,096
Ohh.

208
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,267
Oh, that's pretty.

209
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,468
Whoo!

210
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,103
Hey, man, you better turn that off

211
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:58,071
'cause you don't want that soap
getting on this lambs wool over here

212
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:01,141
That has been woven in
the french boucle style.

213
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,346
What I mean by that is you
can get busy on this stuff.

214
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:09,317
And whoa. Seems like somebody already did.

215
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,084
Allison's?

216
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,919
No. No. Allison never wore thongs.

217
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,882
She, uh, she always wore these
things called boy shorts.

218
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,081
It's one thing I do miss about allison,

219
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:21,683
For all the times I hated her guts,

220
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:23,618
She did have a perfect rear end.

221
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:26,286
She's a little too skinny for me, brother.

222
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:29,623
Like, when I'm at the mall and I see
a woman stop in front of a window

223
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:34,126
And it takes, like, 4 or 5 seconds for
her butt to stop moving and get still...

224
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:38,997
Then she's in the curtis zone.

225
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:43,100
All right, these are
definitely not allison's. Ok.

226
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,236
You think needleman's getting a
little something on the side?

227
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:48,505
If you had a girlfriend,
where would you take her?

228
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:52,341
Raintree lodge on riverside.
Free hbo and heated pool.

229
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:55,777
What's going on in here?

230
00:10:55,778 --> 00:11:00,648
We're just checking out your
boat and holding underwear.

231
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:01,649
Well, those are allison's.

232
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,083
She must have left them here.

233
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:06,286
Ha. Guess again, needleman.
We all know 4 of allison's boobs

234
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:08,922
Wouldn't fit in one of those cups.

235
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:12,158
Ok. Look guys, I may have
had a little indiscretion.

236
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,159
But it was no big deal.
It didn't mean anything.

237
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,094
But you told allison about it, right?

238
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,297
No. But the only reason I didn't tell her

239
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:22,900
Was because I thought it would
make her really, really upset.

240
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,301
Now, look guys.

241
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,870
I know I made a terrible mistake.
But I love allison.

242
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,137
And I may even ask her to marry me.

243
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,872
I don't want this to screw everything up.

244
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,207
Come on, we're boat guys.

245
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,909
Boat guys don't rat out other boat guys.

246
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,544
That's jet ski guys.

247
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,513
All right, but you are going to tell her.

248
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,314
No. I'm not. And neither are you,

249
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:43,917
Because that would immediately
negate your boat guy status.

250
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,753
Ahh. Maybe I don't want to be a boat guy.

251
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:49,989
Look guys, the reason I came clean with you

252
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,391
Is because we're sharing
all this boat stuff,

253
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:55,727
I thought we were taking our
relationship to a cool new level.

254
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,195
You came clean with us
because we caught you.

255
00:11:57,196 --> 00:12:01,567
Ok. Well, however it happened,
I would like to keep this between us.

256
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:03,702
Ok? And gary, if you're gonna go ahead

257
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:06,837
And screw everything up for me
and allison, then it's game on.

258
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,372
And I'm gonna win.

259
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,874
All right, great. Just keep in mind,
you're gonna win a woman

260
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,344
That will never really
understand how to work the head.

261
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,843
Allison, I gotta tell you something.

262
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,810
What's going on?

263
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,978
Well-- allison.

264
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,078
Listen, I've given a thought of thought.

265
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,380
And I know it seems soon, but I love you,

266
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,181
And I want you to be my wife.
Hey, what's up, gary?

267
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:35,251
Oh. Oh. Yeah. Oh my god! Yes,
I'll marry you.

268
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:38,221
Hey, can your thing wait?

269
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,022
No. No, it can't wait.

270
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:41,590
I have to tell it to you. It's important.

271
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,025
Maybe you didn't see the ring.

272
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:47,395
He's a cheater, allison!
I found women's underwear on his boat.

273
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:50,464
I'm not surprised. I rent out
the yacht almost every weekend.

274
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:51,565
Allie knows that. Yeah.

275
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:52,899
You would be amazed by some of the things

276
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,134
I found on the boat.

277
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,302
One time I found a sex
swing hanging over the bed

278
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:59,138
In the master bedroom.

279
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,675
Knock it off, needleman.
Tell her the truth right now.

280
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:04,509
Ok. Gary, please. Please don't do this.

281
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,779
Ok. I know it's a fast engagement,
but it's what I want.

282
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,947
I know this may be hard for you to process,

283
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:12,149
But we both knew this day was
going to come for one of us.

284
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,918
And the fact that you thought it
was going to come for you first,

285
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,221
Is, well, sad and a little funny actually.

286
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:22,591
I'm looking out for you, allison.
You gotta believe me.

287
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:25,126
Howard, are you having an affair?

288
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:28,328
No, allison, I'm not.

289
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,930
Well, that's good enough for me.

290
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:32,098
[gasp] are you kidding me?
Who you going to believe?

291
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,766
Me--the guy you've known for 20 years

292
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,901
Or the guy you've been dating for 6 months?

293
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:40,471
I think I'm gonna go ahead
and go with my fiance.

294
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:44,306
Wow. All right, well, when he breaks your heart,
don't come crawling to me

295
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,675
'cause I'll just have to tell you,
I told you so. All right?

296
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,475
Gary, hold on. No hard feelings.

297
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:51,410
Look, I know you still want to take tom
out for a spin on the old "needlefish."

298
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:54,080
So, she's all yours.

299
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,783
I will for tom's sake.
But I am going to tell my son

300
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:58,785
That if being a boat guy
involves lying and cheating,

301
00:13:58,786 --> 00:13:59,885
It's not worth it.

302
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:01,519
You got it, buddy. Have fun!

303
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,456
Man, these boat names are hilarious.

304
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,525
Look at this, the "boatweiser."

305
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:13,329
You get it? It's like
the beer except a boat.

306
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,065
Look at the "happy hooker."

307
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,000
'cause it's a fishing boat, see?

308
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,835
Oh, well look at this over here.

309
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:24,771
The "blow the man down."

310
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:27,006
Look, it's 2 dudes on deck there that--

311
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:31,151
Oh, I shouldn't be seeing that!
Ok. [indistinct]

312
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,421
I can't believe allison doesn't
know that needleman's lying.

313
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:36,056
She always knew when I was lying.

314
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:38,258
And it got to the point where I would
come home and I would have to tell her

315
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:39,892
How much money I spent, how much I drank,

316
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:44,796
And how long I starred at the hot
neighbor mowing the lawn in her tube top.

317
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:45,964
So, what are you going to do?

318
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,465
Tommy, come on up here!

319
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,802
Hey, if the underwear in the boat
wasn't enough to convince her,

320
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,637
I gotta find something else
that will convince her. Ok?

321
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:54,738
I'm gonna go look around. Hey, tommy.

322
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:55,739
Yeah?

323
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
Come on, you want to steer the boat?

324
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:57,874
Well, yeah. Are you serious?

325
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,576
Yeah, I'm serious. Come on up here, fella.

326
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:02,746
And melissa, you can be
his special navigator.

327
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:03,947
Cool. Yeah, cool.

328
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:06,385
You just keep it pointed
at the lighthouse, ok son.

329
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:08,921
And if you need me,
you just call me on the intercom.

330
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,222
Ok.

331
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,389
Curtis and I are gonna go
down below and do some real,

332
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,324
You know, kinda private business.

333
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,358
All right. Ok.

334
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,559
Let's  pal

335
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:19,697
You're the cutest little captain ever.

336
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:21,032
Aw, thanks.

337
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,133
Hey, look at that "blow the
man down." that's funny.

338
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:26,302
Hey, there's 2 dudes-- ok,
we shouldn't be seeing this.

339
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,339
I searched the staterooms and
the bathrooms, top to bottom,

340
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,707
Nothing incriminating in there.

341
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,142
It's no use. Once we found the underwear,

342
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,380
Probably came back and
cleaned the entire ship.

343
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,684
Oh, no. He definitely did. I don't know
what he used to clean that tanning bed

344
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,052
But I slid right off.

345
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:45,021
We gotta keep looking, curtis.

346
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:46,456
It doesn'tattewhat we find.

347
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:48,157
Once that rock went on allison's finger,

348
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:49,559
He's the new guy in her life.

349
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,793
Man, he's got the edge.

350
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,061
[soft piano music plays]

351
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:54,963
Oh! You're sitting on it. Get off of there!

352
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,598
We gotta keep looking.

353
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,899
We gotta find something.

354
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,333
Well, you keep looking.
I'm gonna even the score my way

355
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,102
By drinking his booze.

356
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:03,604
This is a 17-year-old bottle of scotch

357
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:06,206
That's not going to live
long enough to vote.

358
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,609
We gotta find something.
A pocketbook, some lipstick,

359
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,443
Dead hooker--something.

360
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,613
Oh, my gosh.

361
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:17,649
What? You find a dead hooker?

362
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,450
Better.

363
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,919
A live hooker?

364
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,288
[doorbell]

365
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,223
Hey, they're here.

366
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:28,124
Hi, guys. Come on in.

367
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,492
What's this about, gary?

368
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:33,729
You want me to help you find the
end of the saran wrap again?

369
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,932
It's all the same color!
How I am supposed to find it?!

370
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,367
Allison, I've brought you guys
over here because you were right.

371
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:42,869
I wanted to apologize.
I acted like a complete jerk.

372
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,339
I saw him put the ring on your finger,
and I just absolutely lost it.

373
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,274
It was a huge shock.

374
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,277
I think because I was surprised,

375
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,780
I immediately just let my mind
go to the darkest place it could.

376
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,615
The mind is a tricky thing.

377
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:01,350
And when put on the spot
and put in that situation,

378
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:03,819
I just said the most hurtful thing
about needleman I could think of.

379
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,288
Just nasty words.

380
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:11,092
So, needleman, what do you say?
From one boat guy to another, I'm sorry.

381
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:14,828
So, you're admitting that you falsely
accused me of cheating on allison?

382
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,163
Well, apology accepted, buddy.

383
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,330
All right.

384
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:20,033
Really? Gary, just all of a sudden,
out of the blue,

385
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,033
You're onboard with this?

386
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,569
All aboard! Toot-toot.

387
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,842
Curtis, it's good. All right?

388
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:33,778
All right. Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go into the kitchen.

389
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,514
Excuse me. Congratulations, allison.

390
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,783
Ok. Well, gary, I appreciate the apology.

391
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,618
So, I guess we'll go.

392
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,921
Don't go yet, because I got you
a special engagement present.

393
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:48,189
Needleman--

394
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,659
Don't tell me. You got me
something for my yacht?

395
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,927
Actually I gotou something from your yacht.

396
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:58,031
You have an amazing surveillance
system on that baby.

397
00:17:58,032 --> 00:17:59,465
Care to take a look?

398
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,367
Uh-- what? What?

399
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:04,336
Actually, no. We should get going, allie.

400
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:05,970
Howard, honey, what's wrong?

401
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:09,540
Oh, nothing. I remembered that I just
left the oven on in my house in aspen,

402
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,308
Which you've never seen,

403
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:15,078
And I would like to take you there
right now on my jet. Let's go.

404
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,179
Ok...

405
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,380
Come on, needleman. Come clean.

406
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:19,148
Tell her the truth. No one has to see this.

407
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:21,316
See? See what?! What are
you guys talking about?

408
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,618
Nothing, allison. Gary's freaking out again!

409
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,088
Allison, look at me. Am I freaking out?

410
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,689
No. Actually, you're not.

411
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,258
Ok. You know what?
I want to see what's on the dvd.

412
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,126
Ok. Well, I'm gonna take off--

413
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:35,028
Howard, sit.

414
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,562
Gary, let's see it.

415
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:39,198
Come on. Have a seat.

416
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,500
Enjoy the show needleman.

417
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:46,071
Woman: Wow. Your boat is amazing.

418
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:49,373
Howard: Yacht. Whatever. It doesn't matter.

419
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:50,675
Who's the slut, howard?

420
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:53,410
I don't know. That's not me.

421
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:54,411
Uh-huh.

422
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:56,980
Woman: Come here, howard needleman.

423
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:02,784
Allison, I swear I was going
to tell you about this.

424
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:06,788
Howard: We're gonna take this to our grave!

425
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:08,356
Shut up, needleman!

426
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,525
You know what, gary? I've seen enough.
Just turn it off.

427
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,561
Look, hey. Allison, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to have to show you that.

428
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:17,231
But you just didn't believe
me when I told you the truth.

429
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,166
Allison, look. Why don't we talk about this

430
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,102
Over a very expensive dinner on my train?

431
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:23,770
Ok. You know what, howard?

432
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:25,938
I don't want to go out to dinner with you.

433
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:28,174
In fact, I never want
to see your face again.

434
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:29,775
Get out.

435
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:30,843
Come on, allison.

436
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:32,144
I mean it! Get out!

437
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:34,045
Hold on, allison. Let me tell
you something, needleman.

438
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,613
From one boat guy to another,

439
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:39,077
You got 5 seconds to get out of here
before I drop anchor on your face.

440
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,780
You know what? You can take this with ya!

441
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,048
Are you crazy?! That's a 3-carat diamond!

442
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,950
Ok. Totally, unrelated,
I need to get some fresh air!

443
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:53,498
Are you ready for another?

444
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,634
Oh, hang on.

445
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:04,176
Hit me.

446
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,245
This one's for you.

447
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:11,082
How about the maiden voyage
of the s.S. "gary" boat?

448
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,350
You ready? Yeah.

449
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:13,485
You do the honors.

450
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:15,721
Ahh! Lovely!

451
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:16,922
Ok.

452
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:19,358
Here she goes!

453
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,326
Ohh!

454
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,996
And there she goes!

455
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,332
The guy that sold that to me on ebay

456
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,934
Is going to get a lot of negative comments.

457
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,572
Look, gary. I know you were
just looking out for me.

458
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:36,407
Hey, come on. You don't have to say it.

459
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,342
Wait, were you just going to apologize?

460
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,376
Yeah.

461
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:41,478
Yeah, you gotta say it.

462
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:44,448
I'm sorry I didn't believe you, gary.

463
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:46,283
You don't have to say it.

464
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:50,053
Hey! How'd it go with the ring?

465
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,689
Well, it landed in the neighbor's dog dish.

466
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,325
And now it's inside the neighbor's dog.

467
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:57,893
So, what do we do?

468
00:20:57,894 --> 00:21:00,161
There's only one thing we can do.

469
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:02,763
We wait.
