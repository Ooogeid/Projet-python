1
00:00:00,865 --> 00:00:02,231
<i>Previously on</i> Traveler...

2
00:00:02,913 --> 00:00:03,936
Did you get out?

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,537
We're at the corner. Where are you?

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,863
<i>I'm sorry, I had to do this.</i>

5
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:11,682
You think Will framed us for this?

6
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,396
Will apologized right before

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,898
the museum exploded,
and our faces are on TV.

8
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:17,806
I'm not gonna see you again?

9
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:22,366
Jay, you can't run from this.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,743
I need to figure out
who Will Traveler really is.

11
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,016
Seems Traveler has left us quite a mess.

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,392
You know what to do.

13
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,206
He's an undercover federal agent.
He's one of us.

14
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:34,205
We already know about you
and Maya getting involved.

15
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,400
Maybe we were supposed to die
in the Drexler.

16
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,985
What are you saying?
That my father wanted to kill us?

17
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:45,781
Not until I hear him tell me.

18
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,497
You take off now,
I won't be here when you get back.

19
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:51,544
Don't do this.

20
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:52,982
I have to.

21
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:58,445
He's running! Out of the way!

22
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,625
Wait, wait, wait!

23
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:32,822
FBI! Get out of the way!

24
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:40,528
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know!

25
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:44,893
There!

26
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,484
Suspect heading west on 53rd.
I need backup!

27
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,402
Couldn't bring me in yourself, Jimmy?

28
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:22,679
Had to leave it to Alex?

29
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:27,329
Look, obviously there's been
some kind of... misunderstanding

30
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,892
Why'd you tell Alex I was coming?
Somebody pay you?

31
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,366
Come on.
I'm just a supplier to you guys.

32
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:38,101
You know I don't ask questions.

33
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,886
Any sign of him?

34
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,033
This is Chambers.

35
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,000
We lost Tyler Fog
heading west on 53rd street.

36
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,297
I want roadblocks,
bridge and tunnel closures...

37
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:27,496
Whatever I can get.

38
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,501
And tell N.Y.P.D.
I need bodies down here now.

39
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:32,739
All right.

40
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:39,083
I'm gonna kill you. This is your last
chance to tell me what you know.

41
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:42,371
I told you, I don't know nothing,
I don't know crap.

42
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:44,963
I swear.

43
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:47,693
Where you going, man?

44
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:51,128
What are you doing, Will?

45
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:53,526
Don't do it, okay?

46
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,977
Will, you don't want to do this!

47
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:59,039
All right, all right!
I know something, okay?

48
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:00,736
I know something. It's about Maya.

49
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,775
Okay, the guy who killed your girl?

50
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,621
He stopped here for supplies
on his way to Deer Harbor.

51
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,872
- Who is he?
- I don't know!

52
00:04:11,838 --> 00:04:13,290
I don't know, okay?

53
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,961
No! Oh, God!

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,510
I don't know his name.

55
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:22,206
All I know is he's got brown hair

56
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,412
and he's all inked up,
and he's out of New York.

57
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:25,821
Okay? That's all I know.

58
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,372
We good? Yeah. Where you going, Will?

59
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,911
What are you doing?
You gotta let me down.

60
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:39,951
<i>You reached Kim's cell.
Leave a message.</i>

61
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:43,697
Please, Kim,
I don't know where Jay is...

62
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,951
I thought that you might, and...

63
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,890
And I don't...
I don't know if he was at Eddie Hahn's

64
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,889
when the FBI got there.

65
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:56,197
I went back to get him,
and I guess I was just...

66
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,141
<i>If you're satisfied with your message,
please press one.</i>

67
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:17,639
All agents and officers, gather around.

68
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,711
If Fog is in the area,
then Burchell must be close.

69
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,513
I want random vehicle checks
and a 3-mile grid search.

70
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:26,620
Anyone answering to Fog's description,

71
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:30,344
anyone wearing a hat,
any male between the ages of 16 and 60,

72
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:32,104
stop him. Search him.

73
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,108
Transit police are covering the subway,

74
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,009
we're gonna get this guy tonight.

75
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,293
Let's go!

76
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,907
Borjes, any news on Fog?

77
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:42,557
I'll be right there.

78
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,378
<i>From the scene
of a foot chase that took place</i>

79
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:08,800
<i>on the upper east side, FBI officials
have refused to confirm reports </i>

80
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:12,043
<i>that they were pursuing
Drexler bombing suspect Tyler Fog,</i>

81
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:15,223
<i>saying only that both Fog
and suspect Jay Burchell</i>

82
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,443
<i>are still at large.</i>

83
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,567
What do we got?

84
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,696
N.Y.P.D. spotted it
on Roosevelt avenue in Queens,

85
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,380
brought it here.
V.I.N. Number confirms that it's Fog's.

86
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:31,916
No idea when Fog left it there?

87
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,489
Street cleaning was yesterday.

88
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:35,693
It would have been towed
any time before that.

89
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,428
And nothing inside that explains

90
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:39,314
why they would have
come back to New York?

91
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,490
Not that I could see.

92
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,077
Why abandon the vehicle in Queens?

93
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,319
Fog was in the city,
not exactly nearby. It doesn't track.

94
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,440
- Anything else?
- You heard that surveillance

95
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:55,027
picked up a phone message
Fog left for Burchell girlfriend?

96
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,333
Seems like Fog
doesn't even know where Burchell is.

97
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,429
Kim Doherty's from Queens, right?

98
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,404
Chambers said that he convinced her
to move back in with her folks.

99
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,275
You think this is
just about Burchell's girl?

100
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:30,646
We already know about
your indiscretions...

101
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,264
You and Maya getting involved.

102
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:41,500
- Let her go.
- Unfortunately...

103
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,264
<i>I'll talk to him!</i>

104
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
I told you.

105
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,718
I told you!

106
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,692
It was a recording, Will.
I killed her two hours ago.

107
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,578
<i>I killed her two hours ago.</i>

108
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,591
I'm gonna kill you, I swear to God!

109
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:31,102
Subtitles: swsub.com

110
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:43,910
Mr. Doherty, I'm agent Jan Marlow.

111
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,164
No more. You have put my daughter...

112
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:48,539
I know this has been
a difficult time for your family,

113
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:51,202
but I have some new information
on Tyler Fog and Jay Burchell.

114
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:53,451
- If I can just talk to Kim...
- Talk to my lawyer.

115
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:54,671
Dad, wait.

116
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:58,364
Let her in.

117
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:08,375
This is about making it right.

118
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:11,641
It's about securing
the future of this family.

119
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,396
Without me?

120
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:15,580
You're not strong enough, Tyler.

121
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:34,676
What can I get ya?

122
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,518
Three shots of whiskey
and a bottle of stout.

123
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,239
You know, I figure I'm going down.

124
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,134
Might as well dull the pain
as much as possible, right?

125
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:48,298
What was that?

126
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:52,489
Forget it.

127
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,053
Yeah, that's right.

128
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,581
I'm him.

129
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,910
Let me guess,
the man of my dreams, right?

130
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:11,627
Afraid I've heard that one before.

131
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:14,721
Have you?

132
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,390
Well, maybe this time it's true.

133
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:26,833
- Thanks.
- You have news about Jay?

134
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:29,375
Tyler Fog was spotted in Manhattan.

135
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:32,387
- The news said that wasn't...
- It was Tyler.

136
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:35,976
We found his car
less than a mile from here.

137
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,928
Fingerprints place Jay inside.

138
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:40,513
Wait.

139
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:41,695
Jay's here?

140
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:44,490
Well, that's what we're trying
to determine.

141
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,558
Have you heard from Jay
or seen him in the last 24 hours?

142
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:51,613
What about Tyler? Heard from him?

143
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,070
No.

144
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:01,732
Well, it must be nice
having your family around

145
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:03,148
in the middle of all this.

146
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,133
I guess.

147
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,582
My dad's a little...

148
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,633
Well, you met him.

149
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:11,515
He just wants to protect you...

150
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:15,486
Just like you want to protect Jay.

151
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,317
Thing is, you can't protect him,

152
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:22,508
but I can.

153
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:25,445
I can protect him.

154
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,257
As long as he's on the run,
he's a moving target.

155
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,294
- But if he turns himself in...
- Then what?

156
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,250
I can help him,
see that he's treated fairly,

157
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,444
that proper procedure is followed
when he comes in.

158
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,576
That doesn't always happen
with terror suspects.

159
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,622
Something else, Kim.

160
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,992
I know you were telling the truth
about Will Traveler.

161
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,663
What?

162
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:52,934
I know Will exists,
and I think he's still alive.

163
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,452
And if you're right

164
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,198
that he set Jay and Tyler up
in the Drexler,

165
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:01,102
then I think that Will
might still be a threat to them.

166
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:10,510
If Jay does try to contact you,
give me a call,

167
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,070
day or night.

168
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:34,096
Does this routine usually work for you?

169
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,222
Wait, routine?

170
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,320
- Killer. Ouch.
- Let's get out of here, baby.

171
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,997
Wait, this is what you call okay?
Seriously?

172
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:42,905
- You got a problem, bro?
- No.

173
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:47,912
I don't, because actually
while you were over there doing shots,

174
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:50,533
I was over here enjoying
this beautiful woman's company,

175
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:52,500
so, I think it's you
who's got the problem.

176
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:53,664
I got a problem.

177
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:55,745
No problems.

178
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,185
- Nobody's got any problems, all right?
- Come on, let's go, skinny, you and me.

179
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,820
- Let's dance outside, bro.
- There's my door. See ya, man.

180
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:05,022
Dude, what is your problem, man?
I had that.

181
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,473
Oh, you had that. Easy,

182
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,327
that guy had 30 pounds on you.

183
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:10,811
Please. I got skills, man.

184
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:14,408
I think you need
to quit pulling this crap,

185
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,637
'cause one of these days
I might not be around to save your ass.

186
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,535
It's already paid for. "Kim Doherty"?

187
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:34,886
- I didn't order any...
- It's already paid for.

188
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,307
I want that info now.

189
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,159
You should've told me
you were gonna question Kim Doherty.

190
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,272
I didn't plan on it, sir,

191
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,932
but when we found Fog's car,
I put two and two together.

192
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,149
- I didn't want to waste any time.
- Waste time?

193
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:10,378
What about all the time I've spend
cultivating Doherty as a witness?

194
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,232
- You consider that a waste?
- Sir, I...

195
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,449
What, are you trying
to make yourself look better,

196
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,039
trying to cut me out of the loop?

197
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,538
Good.

198
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,159
Don't.

199
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:55,390
Listen, my shift's ending,

200
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:57,917
if you wouldn't mind
settling your tab...

201
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:04,305
Anyone ever tell you
you look like that bomber guy?

202
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,599
I've been getting that a lot this week.

203
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:27,944
I wasn't sure if you were gonna come.

204
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,044
Neither was I.

205
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:33,107
I missed you.

206
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:40,918
- What?
- I don't know.

207
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:46,499
Hey, it's me. Talk to me.

208
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:47,974
Please.

209
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:50,630
Just...

210
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:54,419
You don't know
what it's been like since you left.

211
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,935
I know.
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

212
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,097
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:04,283
I got a plan, okay?

214
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,248
And soon everything...
Everything will get back to normal.

215
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:10,224
Normal? Nothing is normal.

216
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:14,984
Everything is different,
everything is gone.

217
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,676
Your career, my career... gone.

218
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,610
Our apartment... gone.

219
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:22,065
Our life together...

220
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:24,729
gone... because you ran!

221
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,328
I said I would come back to you,
and I did.

222
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:14,022
I got a message...

223
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:15,647
from Tyler.

224
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:18,773
What did he say?

225
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,933
That he was looking for you.

226
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:24,513
He said where he was?

227
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,212
No.

228
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,706
Carlton Fog set us up.

229
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:34,521
What?

230
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:37,145
Tyler's dad knew about
the Drexler bombing in advance.

231
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:40,345
Tyler didn't want to believe it, but...

232
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,304
I'm pretty sure Carlton Fog's
been in on this from the beginning.

233
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,209
Tyler's father?

234
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,617
- That's...
- It's crazy, I know.

235
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
I know.

236
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,306
I don't know if I can do this on my own.

237
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,388
You don't have to.

238
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,747
That woman from the FBI
came to see me today...

239
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:14,548
Agent Marlow.
Jay, she knows about Will.

240
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:17,446
I think she believes
there's more to this,

241
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,308
that it's not your fault.

242
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,992
Did you bring your camera like I asked?

243
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:41,687
I found this stuff in Will's lock box.

244
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,118
Will sure had us fooled.

245
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,339
What?

246
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:06,040
There aren't any pictures on this.

247
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:12,936
You're right, but it does have
an audio file.

248
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,145
My camera's got a speaker, so...

249
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:17,818
<i>There is one aspect of this</i>

250
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:20,174
<i>that we haven't discussed,
and that's your roommates.</i>

251
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,018
<i>They will be framed for the bombing...</i>

252
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,284
<i>And they are expected
to die in the blast.</i>

253
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:27,261
Oh, my God.

254
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:29,189
<i>Is that gonna be a problem for you?</i>

255
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,884
<i>No. Not at all.</i>

256
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,292
<i>Good, because
there's no room for error, Will.</i>

257
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:38,024
<i>The Drexler's just the first step
in a much larger plan.</i>

258
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:41,184
<i>Your country appreciates it.</i>

259
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,399
Thanks.

260
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,147
You think Burchell and Fog
coming to New York

261
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:49,864
has anything to do with our John Doe?

262
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,238
Otis Whaley? Possible.

1
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:55,895
I got N.Y.P.D. watching the apartment
where we found him.

2
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,488
Still no hits on the B.O.L.O.

3
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:00,092
Come here.

4
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,501
You tell anybody he was a fed?

5
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,139
Not yet. I'm still waiting to see
if any of my leads pan out,

6
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:15,450
but I think
Chambers ought to know, don't you?

7
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,150
Of course. It's just...

8
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,216
What?

9
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,472
It's just that I think
it might be a good idea

10
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:23,957
to keep a lid on this for a while.

11
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:27,045
Pursue it on your own.
Call it an instinct.

12
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,894
We're talking about defying procedure.

13
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,528
We're talking about an ex-FBI agent

14
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,367
who escaped from our custody
and killed one of our people.

15
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,216
He's a subject of interest
in the Drexler bombing.

16
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:39,685
What if this guy
still has contacts inside the agency?

17
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,648
The minute you run this
up the chain of command...

18
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:45,419
Whaley and his contacts
start covering their tracks.

19
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,041
Why would Will keep a recording

20
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,650
that implicates him
in the bombing

21
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,784
and in this much larger plan?

22
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:58,182
Well, and what does that even mean?

23
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,575
More bombings?

24
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:03,341
I don't know.

25
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:05,592
Maybe.

26
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:12,905
Wait. What are you doing?

27
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:14,779
Going to the FBI.

28
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:18,739
Oh, Jay, it is the right thing to do.

29
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,489
They almost caught Tyler today.

30
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,108
It is just a matter of time,

31
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,913
and agent Marlow said
that she could help protect you...

32
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:27,836
- Protect me?
- I mean, if you turned yourself in,

33
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,206
- she said that she...
- No,

34
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:31,676
turning myself in is...

35
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:34,160
not exactly what I had in mind.

36
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:50,794
Ed Carter?

37
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:53,668
That's me.

38
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:56,700
You work late?

39
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,168
You'd be surprised the number
of people who get drunk

40
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:01,701
and decide they want a tattoo
at 1:00 in the morning.

41
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:03,389
Happy to help 'em out.

42
00:22:04,504 --> 00:22:05,544
First tat?

43
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:08,589
I'm told this is your work.

44
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,609
You know, it is gettin' kind of late.

45
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:12,670
But you just said that...

46
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:14,985
Thing is, my time is valuable.

47
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:17,420
If you're not a paying customer...

48
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:23,585
Know you're not lookin' for a bribe, Ed.

49
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,977
No, not me.

50
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,482
Yeah, I did those.

51
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,920
On who?

52
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:33,473
Guy's called Martin.

53
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:35,743
That a first name or a last name?

54
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:38,296
Don't know.

55
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:40,756
When did you do his tattoos?

56
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:41,926
Still doin' 'em.

57
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,990
Takes a while
to do a sleeve that elaborate.

58
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,034
There's only so much pain
a guy can take.

59
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:49,880
Martin's got a higher tolerance
for pain than most.

60
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:55,003
When did you see him last?

61
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:56,901
About a week ago.

62
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:00,552
He's in and out of town, so it's
taking me a while to get them finished.

63
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:02,450
You know where I can find him?

64
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:06,201
Said he stays there...

65
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:07,607
Hotel Regal.

66
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:10,662
Thanks.

67
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:33,956
Hi, Kim. Everying okay?

68
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:37,031
I need to talk... in person.

69
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:38,476
I'm on my way.

70
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:45,834
- Where are you going?
- Kim Doherty.

71
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,524
She's seen Jay. I know it.

72
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:49,502
Well, hold on.
I'll roll with you.

73
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,256
I don't want to spook her.
If it checks out I'll call you in.

74
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,338
I've got three Tyler Fog sightings
within a 2-block radius

75
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,048
of 42nd street and 8th avenue
all within the last five minutes.

76
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,232
Make that four.

77
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:01,846
Everybody, let's go!

78
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:05,534
Pull up live feeds
of every traffic camera in the area.

79
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:12,170
Come on, come on.

80
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:15,293
There!

81
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,374
Who is that girl?

82
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:20,188
Get me a visual I.D.
Cross-check with the D.M.V.

83
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:21,808
I want her name and where she lives,

84
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:24,413
everything about her.
Where are they?

85
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,743
43rd and 7th, heading south.

86
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,825
I want all available agents
on the scene,

87
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,151
and notify local police units
in the area. Now.

88
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:35,329
We got him.

89
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,097
42nd and 7th, southwest corner,
heading east.

90
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:43,030
Times Square.
Where are all the damn cops?.

91
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,938
All units in the area
have been notified.

92
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:46,348
Should be any second now.

93
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:48,764
They're not going anywhere.
It's a live feed, right?

94
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:50,889
There is a 30-second streaming delay.

95
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:57,483
Notify transit police.

96
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:59,634
Suspend all subway service
out of Times Square.

97
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:01,794
Almost every line in the city
goes through there.

98
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:03,980
- With a 30-second...
- Fog could headed anywhere

99
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:06,259
in the city by now. Damn!

100
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:18,630
- Should we talk inside?
- Actually, no...

101
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,550
I can't talk.

102
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:22,284
I have to get going.

103
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:24,649
- I tried to call.
- I didn't get a message.

104
00:25:26,856 --> 00:25:27,856
Sorry.

105
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:42,269
So sorry.

106
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:55,919
Go back.

107
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:02,106
Push in.

108
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:06,459
Got a name on this girl yet?

109
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:08,691
So far, no matches with the D.M.V.

110
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:14,970
Sir, doesn't it strike you as odd?

111
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,179
What?

112
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:19,436
Doesn't it strike you as odd
that in the middle of all this,

113
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:20,825
Tyler Fog is on a date?

114
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:22,189
We need to talk.

115
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:23,877
Certainly.

116
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:32,819
Bring it back up.
Maybe we missed something.

117
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:37,223
Who was that?

118
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:41,054
Robert Cole, head of O.P.R.
handles employee misconduct.

119
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:44,355
Thought Cole was out of D.C.
What's he doing here?

120
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:47,411
I don't know.

121
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,042
Just tell me, dad,
that you didn't try to have us killed.

122
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:20,837
This is the real world, Tyler,

123
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:23,597
and there are choices
that have to be made.

124
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:26,213
Some of those choices
are bigger than you.

125
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,683
Stay here and watch the house.
I'm on this.

126
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,836
Come on!

127
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:14,400
You killed her.

128
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
Who?

129
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:16,976
Maya.

130
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,985
I don't know who you're talkin' about.

131
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:22,635
That's the worst part.

132
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:24,851
Hometown?

133
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:30,574
Then you know
that I was just followin' orders.

134
00:30:33,102 --> 00:30:34,102
Who gave the order?

135
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:37,582
I said who gave the order?!

136
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:39,561
Who are we working for?!

137
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:40,788
Freed!

138
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:42,397
Freed gives all the orders.

139
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:46,007
Look, Hometown's
been shut down for two years.

140
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:48,775
Freed's used us for his own agenda.

141
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,813
You don't want me.

142
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,334
Go after Freed.

143
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:56,896
You got something he wants.

144
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:01,046
Please.

145
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:12,209
You made the right decision.

146
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:15,647
Your girl Mary would have
appreciated that.

147
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:26,792
Her name was Maya.

148
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:43,265
My office.

149
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:54,143
Why didn't you tell me
you sought increased security clearance

150
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,670
to investigate our escapee?

151
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:59,213
And when that failed,
you received covert assistance

152
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:02,546
from an N.S.A. Agent...
Harold Stone?

153
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,256
Agent Fowler was a friend, sir.

154
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:06,999
His death...

155
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:10,840
I took it personally,
and I took it upon myself

156
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,891
to find out
about the man who killed him.

157
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,974
I'm sorry that I strayed
from procedure, but...

158
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:16,415
No apologies necessary.

159
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:21,198
N.S.A.? Very resourceful.

160
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:23,437
I'm impressed.

161
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:24,688
Thank you.

162
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:28,162
Still, this guy... what's his name...
Whaley

163
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Otis Whaley.

164
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,158
I know agent Stone
told you Whaley's ex-FBI.

165
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,627
What I don't know is why you
went to Stone about this at all.

166
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,500
I could have gotten you that information

167
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,148
without alerting O.P.R.

168
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,481
I'm sorry, sir.
With Burchell and Fog in the city...

169
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:51,934
Unlike your partner,

170
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:54,129
you've got an immaculate record.

171
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:55,446
Don't ruin it.

172
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:01,513
Agent Marlow has made it clear
she wants my job.

173
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:04,428
But you're former military.

174
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,257
You respect the chain of command,
correct?

175
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:12,695
Yes, sir.

176
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:13,819
Good.

177
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,889
I want a full report
on Whaley by morning.

178
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,019
Will do.

179
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:43,637
Who's that man with my father?

180
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:47,154
Don't know him.
I think he's up from D.C.

181
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,663
"Carlton Fog with
homeland security's Jack Freed."

182
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,529
Jack Freed?

183
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:26,499
"Homeland security's Jack Freed,
former deputy director, FBI."

184
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:29,498
This is proof, man,

185
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:32,081
something to take to the FBI.

186
00:36:13,728 --> 00:36:16,622
I don't want to hurt you.
I just want to talk.

187
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,011
I'm listening.

188
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:20,438
We didn't have anything to do
with the Drexler bombing.

189
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,888
We were set up,
and I have proof.

190
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,762
Kim, it's Tyler. Listen to me.

191
00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:34,024
You're breaking up. I'll call you back.

192
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:47,097
Are you crazy?
My phone's tapped.

193
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,870
<i>Listen to me.
There's this guy, Jack Freed,</i>

194
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,770
he's FBI. He used to be
deputy director for god sake, okay?

195
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:56,641
Now I think...
I know he's mixed up in this.

196
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:59,535
<i>He's on a list of people
who sold Holloway stock </i>

197
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:00,904
<i>before the Drexler bombing.</i>

198
00:37:01,382 --> 00:37:04,449
Listen,
my father is working with the FBI,

199
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,252
trying to have us killed.

200
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:10,138
Now before I took off,
Jay said he was going to the FBI.

201
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:13,271
- <i>You can't let him to that.</i>
- No, it's too late.

202
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:14,427
What do you mean?

203
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,949
He's meeting with agent Marlow,
now at... at Fervor.

204
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,467
<i>On fourteen?</i>

205
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:21,583
Okay,
I'm going down there now.

206
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,750
Oh, my God.
you are that bomber guy.

207
00:37:38,477 --> 00:37:40,387
Looks like you got it all figured out.

208
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:43,621
I gotta hand it to you, Burchell.
Not a bad place to meet...

209
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,274
loud, dark,
easy to get lost in the crowd.

210
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:48,268
And luring me here...

211
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:50,936
you and your girlfriend
make a good team.

212
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:53,666
Kim had nothing to do with this.
It was my idea.

213
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:55,112
What's this?

214
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:57,205
Names of people
who sold Holloway Insurance,

215
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,329
who profited from the Drexler bombing,

216
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:01,452
a few of Will Traveler's fake passports.

217
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:02,595
I see.

218
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,950
That's nothing.

219
00:38:09,142 --> 00:38:10,956
This is a recording
of some guy named Joseph

220
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:12,793
telling Will to blow up the Drexler,

221
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,365
Saying he should frame
Tyler and me for doing it,

222
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:18,437
and the Drexler is just the first step
in a much larger plan.

223
00:38:18,865 --> 00:38:21,754
It's all very interesting, Jay.
This could exonerate you.

224
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:26,701
Turn around and place
your hands on your head!

225
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,560
I told you we've been set up.
If you just listen to that recording...

226
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:35,521
Unfortunately, this is about
more than just the Drexler now.

227
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,953
You're suspected of murder,
not to mention the kidnapping

228
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,127
of Tyler'susiness school friend
Eddie Hahn.

229
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:43,927
Jay, don't move!

230
00:38:44,257 --> 00:38:45,550
Everybody, stay calm!

231
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:05,034
This is Marlow.

232
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,549
I've got Jay Burchell
at Fervor on 14th street.

233
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:11,635
<i>1013, 1013,</i>

234
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:14,827
<i>Suspect Jay Burchell
has been spotted at Club Fervor.</i>

235
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:34,081
<i>1013. Burchell's
been spotted in the alley.</i>

236
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:35,993
Copy that.
I'm on my way.

237
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,291
Freeze!

238
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,503
Put your hands where I can see them.

239
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:01,617
You drop the gun!

240
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,575
I said drop your gun!

241
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:10,353
Come on, Tyler. Let this
man go and surrender peacefully.

242
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,985
- We can straighten this out.
- Jay, she's lying.

243
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:15,433
- They're in on this.
- What are you talking about?

244
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,267
You have to believe me.
The FBI is involved. I have proof.

245
00:40:20,677 --> 00:40:22,567
Yeah. See? She knows!

246
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,525
I know that you were
telling the truth about Will Traveler.

247
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:28,195
We've got him on video.
You were telling the truth about Will,

248
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,608
and I think you were telling
the truth about the Drexler,

249
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:32,634
and with the evidence
you showed me tonight...

250
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:34,756
Don't believe her.
You have to trust me.

251
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:36,938
- Now you do as I say.
- You drop that gun!

252
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:38,982
Come on, Tyler,
you're not gonna shoot anyone!

253
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:40,292
No, but I will.
