1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,089
<i>Previously on</i> Traveler...

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:06,000
Head down first. I'll be right behind,
taping the whole thing.

3
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:07,193
Good luck.

4
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:09,737
Hold it!

5
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:13,530
<i>- Did you get out?</i>
- Yeah, we're at the corner.

6
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,723
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm sorry, I had to do this.</i>

7
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:20,312
You think Will framed us for this?

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,945
Will apologized right before
the museum exploded,

9
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:24,617
and our faces are on TV?

10
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:28,034
<i>We think a friend of ours was in
the building. His name's Will Traveler.</i>

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,817
We found your friend
Traveler in the museum... dead.

12
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:34,241
<i>I'm standing outside the home
of girlfriend of suspect Jay...</i>

13
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,321
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!

14
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:42,231
What happened to Will?

15
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:44,209
The only people you trust
are each other.

16
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:46,897
There's one more place
to look for evidence on Will.

17
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,438
A train schedule.
He's marked trains to Deer Harbor.

18
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:51,038
Yeah, that's where he's from!

19
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:58,203
Then what do you want?

20
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:51,550
Excuse me.
Aren't you Maggie Hamilton's kid?

21
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:53,965
No, ma'am.

22
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,469
It's uncanny.
You could be twins.

23
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,617
Excuse me.

24
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:12,837
It's the guys from the Drexler!

25
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,976
Stop them! Someone stop them!

26
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:19,179
- What now?
- Pull the cord.

27
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,467
Federal marshal! Freeze!

28
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:09,008
It's time to go.

29
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:17,498
<i>Next stop... Deer Harbor, Maine.</i>

30
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,882
You get any sleep?

31
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:39,508
Not enough.

32
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:42,632
I've had, like, five hours
in the last two days.

33
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,378
If we don't start getting some sleep,
we're not gonna be on the run for long.

34
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,982
I'm gonna go check this out.

35
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,541
It's a reservation code, son...

36
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,820
from two weeks ago.

37
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:09,978
Any idea who it's for?

38
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:11,783
I can't tell you that.

39
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
You sure?

40
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:21,049
Daniel Taft.

41
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,278
It's gotta mean something.

42
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,221
Yeah. It means someone named
Daniel Taft... not Will Traveler...

43
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:27,965
took the train here two weeks ago.

44
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:31,619
Yeah, or Will was using
the name Daniel Taft.

45
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:38,478
Come on. If Will was here,
maybe someone knew him.

46
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:41,597
You feel it?

47
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:44,301
- What?
- We're being followed.

48
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:47,544
No, you're paranoid.

49
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,261
Maybe I'm right, Jay.
Maybe we should leave.

50
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:51,886
Will Traveler, Daniel Taft,

51
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:54,388
we don't even know
who we're looking for at this point.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,609
No, I think leaving's a bad idea.

53
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,930
"Have books... Will Travel"?

54
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,091
- All right. You stay here.
- No way am I missing this.

55
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,543
We can't always walk around together.
It's too risky.

56
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,788
If one of us gets caught,
the other one's gonna...

57
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:33,653
Alright?

58
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,765
Can I help you find something?

59
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:13,829
No, thanks. I'm... Just browsing.

60
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,304
My name's Maya. Just let me know
if you have any questions.

61
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,752
- You won't believe this.
- Forensics found something else?

62
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:32,903
No, the techs did.

63
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:34,893
It turns out that stuff
we found in New Haven...

64
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,020
Burchell's manifesto, Fog's video...
It's already on the internet.

65
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,019
Stuff's on more than 50 different
web sites, ready for download.

66
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:45,664
<i>It's 2006, and the America
our parents knew is long gone.</i>

67
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:48,198
<i>A democracy? What democracy?</i>

68
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:51,149
<i>We don't even have elections
anymore. We have auctions.</i>

69
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:53,807
<i>President Shears has sold this country</i>

70
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,234
<i>to the highest bidder.
It's unbelievable...</i>

71
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,342
Looks like the perfect way
for Burchell and Fog

72
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:01,184
to promote their hatred of the President
and his administration.

73
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,687
<i>The right to do whatever they want.</i>

74
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:05,415
<i>This generation needs
to stand up for what's right.</i>

75
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:07,973
<i>Take a stand.
It's time to have a revolution.</i>

76
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,495
<i>We need to wake up
and take this country back.</i>

77
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,280
<i>It's time for blood in the streets.</i>

78
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,175
<i>Blood in the street.</i>

79
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,591
It doesn't make any sense.

80
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:21,285
I know that look.

81
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,214
Why take the risk?

82
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:25,673
What? Going back to New Haven?

83
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:29,044
Going back to destroy evidence
that's already on the internet.

84
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:30,611
Destroying the originals,

85
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,624
covering for the girl who had them...

86
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,477
- Maybe they're just toying with us.
- Put yourself in their shoes.

87
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,629
You're on the run.

88
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,220
Do you go back for evidence
that's already out in the open?

89
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:40,898
I get it, but that is their stuff.

90
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:43,710
Hair fibers matched
on the clothes that we salvaged.

91
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,234
Fingerprint samples were positive,

92
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,548
and last night we gave them
a chance to come in,

93
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:48,993
and they still ran.

94
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,450
<i>We need to wake up
and take this country back.</i>

95
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,242
<i>It's time for blood in the streets.</i>

96
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:56,064
<i>Blood in the street.</i>

97
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:06,971
Subtitles : swsub.com

98
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,197
Okay, Doherty, you're in luck.
The photographer dropped the charges.

99
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:45,956
- Is this your store?
- Yes, it is.

100
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:48,686
I like the name.

101
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,875
Thanks.

102
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,533
<i>On The Road</i>. Good book.

103
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:59,407
$9.43, please.

104
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,188
You know, I have a friend
who used to live here.

105
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,895
He talks about this place all the time.

106
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,855
- Yeah?
- Yeah. His name's Will Traveler.

107
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,996
I've never heard of him.
I can see why he likes my store, though.

108
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,223
<i>Are you sure you don't know him?</i>

109
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:21,690
<i>He said he came here a lot.</i>

110
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:23,864
<i>Yeah. I think I would remember
a name like that.</i>

111
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,059
Enjoy your book.

112
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,581
How about Daniel Taft?

113
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:32,685
Ever heard of him?

114
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,923
Sorry. I can't help you.

115
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:38,879
Can't or won't?

116
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:41,391
It's important.

117
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:42,867
- We need to figure...
- Look,

118
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,468
I would love to help you,
but I don't know your friend.

119
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,594
It's a small town.
Maybe you should try city hall?

120
00:09:53,747 --> 00:09:54,747
That's okay.

121
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:57,353
Thanks for your time.

122
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:58,561
No problem.

123
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,168
- So she knew the name Daniel Taft?
- Yeah, I think so.

124
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,184
Then she was lying to you.
We've gotta go back.

125
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:18,932
And do what? Say, "please"?

126
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,913
Okay. We follow her.

127
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,847
Just give me a minute, okay?
I need to think.

128
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:31,105
Since when did this become
a one-man show?

129
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:36,684
Look, if you want to make
suggestions, make good ones.

130
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:38,384
She mentioned city hall.

131
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,965
That's where police are based
in small towns like this.

132
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:43,259
What if she recognized me?

133
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:46,132
Then we'd be sitting
in the back of a cop car,

134
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:47,695
not at this table.

135
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,287
You're not always right.

136
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,661
<i>You can see the level
of Tyler Fog's animosity</i>

137
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,217
<i>towards president Shears.</i>

138
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,705
<i>President Shears has sold this country</i>

139
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,573
<i>to the highest bidder.
It's time for blood in the streets.</i>

140
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,500
<i>Blood in the streets.</i>

141
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:19,117
<i>What I have to say is this.</i>

142
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,897
<i>The actions that the United States
takes...</i>

143
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:23,164
This guy is a liar.

144
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:26,120
The man's never fully answered
a question in his whole life.

145
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:29,133
Wouldn't know the truth
if it walked up and bit him on the ass.

146
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:32,612
Well, I am shocked...
Shocked to learn that politicians lie.

147
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:35,200
Any thoughts on where
this country's headed, Mr. Fog?

148
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,056
Turn that off. I want to watch this.

149
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:39,779
America needs to hear from you.
The future of this country

150
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,146
is guys like us,
not blowhards like Shears.

151
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:45,840
Yeah, he's right. Besides, this guy's
got more hot air than the Hindenburg.

152
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:48,476
<i>I would call this
a working vacation, Peter.</i>

153
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,367
<i>And just because I'm leaving Washington,</i>

154
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,340
<i>doesn't mean
that Washington is leaving me.</i>

155
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:56,191
- Oh, God.
- That's crap, Jay.

156
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:57,492
Hey, listen up!

157
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:02,656
President Shears has sold this country

158
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,213
to the highest bidder.

159
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,277
I think it's time for blood
in the streets.

160
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,937
Blood in the street.

161
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:28,110
Will's video is on the news.

162
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:30,319
The one he's been shooting
the past two years

163
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,347
- every place we go.
- His video blog?

164
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:34,459
Yeah, "blood in the streets."
you remember that?

165
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:36,157
- That was a joke.
- Not anymore.

166
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,654
The video was part of the frame job.

167
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:43,724
- Son of a bitch!
- Think.

168
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:47,035
Did you ever see his blog
other than on his computer?

169
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,724
Okay. So what do you want to do?

170
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,233
Honestly? I want to go to New York,
find Kim and disappear,

171
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,522
but since that's not an option,
I guess we keep looking for Daniel Taft.

172
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:02,775
Good,

173
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,241
'cause I found a listing
for Daniel Taft...

174
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:07,914
but it's not a house.

175
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:18,195
Fog's video...
we have the originating I.P. address?

176
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:20,084
World Wide Web... Video's everywhere.

177
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,796
Tracing it back to the first computer

178
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:23,917
that uploaded it
won't be easy or quick.

179
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,261
What's going on?

180
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,077
Q.D. Came back with results
of Burchell's manifesto.

181
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:31,442
The handwriting analysis
was inconclusive.

182
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,075
Apparently, the Ps don't match up.

183
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:38,301
We need a hand-writing exemplar
to make a match,

184
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:40,863
so I'm going to the source...
Mom.

185
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:47,492
Hi.

186
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:53,476
Christmas card, 2002...

187
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:55,529
Jay's last communication with me.

188
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:57,458
"Happy Holidays, Jay."

189
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,581
Thank you. This will help.

190
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,453
To convict my son or exonerate him?

191
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:03,613
To understand him.

192
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,608
So why don't you two talk?

193
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:09,938
Does it have to do with Jay's father?

194
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:12,797
Jay thinks I betrayed him,

195
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,915
that I left his father
in his time of need.

196
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,833
But I didn't. I was protecting my son.

197
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,431
Protecting him from what?

198
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:20,334
Jay's father was a soldier.

199
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:22,762
Ambitious, loyal.

200
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,553
But when he was court-martialed,

201
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:27,741
things changed.

202
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,357
It wasn't safe for us to stay.

203
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,699
So how old was Jay when his father died?

204
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:35,616
15.

205
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:38,841
His death must have been tough
for both of you.

206
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,475
You think that's why Jay would do this,
don't you?

207
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,782
To avenge his father.

208
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,302
- That's what the press are saying.
- What do you say?

209
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,542
There were times when I questioned
the goodness in my husband.

210
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:54,268
Never Jay.

211
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:03,204
Number 32.

212
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,504
Are you sure this is it?

213
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:12,472
- This is the place.
- Then where's Taft's boat?

214
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,251
The girl at the store was named Maya.

215
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:24,889
Come on.

216
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:04,495
The press is having a field day
since you took out that photographer.

217
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,752
This is the second time
you've given me a ride home this week.

218
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,952
You've been getting
in a lot of trouble lately.

219
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,953
Your men
already went through everything.

220
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:38,834
Sorry.

221
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:40,467
Old habits.

222
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,615
You have family in the area, don't you?

223
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:44,927
Queens. My mom and dad.

224
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:47,248
Maybe you should visit them.

225
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,444
Take a break from all this.

226
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:51,081
I'll be fine.

227
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,400
You ever heard of Occam's Razor?

228
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,037
Given two choices...

229
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,138
... the simplest theory
is usually correct.

230
00:16:58,503 --> 00:17:00,096
You learned that in FBI school?

231
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:03,049
The way I see it,
there are two possibilities.

232
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,387
Either a massive conspiracy

233
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,498
has created the persona of Will Traveler

234
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:09,743
and manipulated events
for the past two years

235
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,373
to frame your boyfriend,

236
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:15,623
or Jay Burchell and Tyler Fog...

237
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:18,773
two men with a bone
to pick with President Shears...

238
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:22,422
joined forces with a third individual
to commit an act of terrorism.

239
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,047
I told you, Jay is not involved.

240
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,547
Then why is he still running?

241
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:28,915
He's scared.

242
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:30,872
Of this vast conspiracy?

243
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,228
Yes.

244
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,075
Or maybe he's still on the run
because he's now linked to a murder

245
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,653
and the disappearance
of a deputy in upstate New York.

246
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,041
I have a daughter, Kim.

247
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,333
Senior in college.

248
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:52,848
I pretty much let her run her own life,

249
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,942
and she pretty much does
a good job of it,

250
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,745
but when she's about to get hurt,
I step in.

251
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:02,904
Something's telling me
you're gonna get hurt in this.

252
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,354
Thanks for the concern.

253
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:07,991
Take a break from this
before you get into more trouble.

254
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,952
I may not be there next time
to bail you out.

255
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:29,913
I think miss Doherty
is gonna help our case.

256
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,355
Look at this.

257
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:58,807
Somebody planned
on being away a long time.

258
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,657
And if Will was Daniel Taft...

259
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,899
... this boat was his out.

260
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:17,596
What kind of person
would keep stuff like this around?

261
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:19,395
A soldier.

262
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:24,673
You know, if Will was planning a trip...

263
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:27,770
Then maybe he made a record.

264
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,573
Maybe he charted a course or something.

265
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,079
Somebody's coming.

266
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:58,670
Who the hell are you two?

267
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:01,397
Look, we're really sorry.
We didn't mean to intrude.

268
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,129
We're looking for a friend.

269
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:06,323
Are you Daniel Taft?

270
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:10,906
Yep, and this is my boat.

271
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:23,370
So this means what, exactly?

272
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:26,390
The chemical residue
in the box found in New Haven

273
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:29,048
matches the taggants
found at the Drexler bombing...

274
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:31,715
Aluminum, naphthalene, palmitate.

275
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,821
Napalm. So these guys are our doers?

276
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:37,105
- It's not my job to speculate.
- But it is mine, so spit it out.

277
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,478
- Your suspects are students, right?
- Yale grads.

278
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:40,755
One with military training.

279
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,212
This is an exotic mixture,
even for the military.

280
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,894
Camp Pendleton and Fort Hood
both have small quanties.

281
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,259
But we checked those out,
and they're not missing any.

282
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:49,538
So this is homemade.

283
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,651
One of our suspects
was studying chemistry.

284
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:54,349
Right, but you don't learn
this kind of thing in chem 101.

285
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,056
I don't care where you went to school.

286
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:57,586
- But it's not impossible?
- No.

287
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,985
If you could put your hands
on the right ingredients.

288
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:03,285
Most times, nut jobs like this,
it's 40 pounds of fertilizer,

289
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,289
a few blasting caps, and boom,
you're on the 11:00 news.

290
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:09,169
I'm not saying your guys
aren't the doers.

291
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,921
I'm just saying
this isn't the work of amateurs.

292
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,596
Lab says the chemical taggants
at the Drexler

293
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,841
are a close match
with the New Haven boxes.

294
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:24,299
Evidence aside, what do you think?

295
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:28,038
Fog and Burchell are developing
a profile like I've never seen before.

296
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:29,631
There are variables to the evidence.

297
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,839
- I'm not sure what to think.
- And the manifesto?

298
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:34,926
Much more typical of this kind
of perp... political, aggrieved.

299
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:36,183
Would you take it to court?

300
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,445
Not without better confirmation
on the handwriting.

301
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:40,428
I need to explore
the evidence more fully.

302
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,737
Nonetheless, Burchell and Fog
remain our best and only suspects.

303
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:44,901
Yes, sir.

304
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,702
I spoke with Burchell's mother.

305
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:49,921
So has half the bureau.
She's a dead-end.

306
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,958
Jay's father stood his ground
to the end.

307
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:53,546
He lost his family, his name.

308
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:55,401
He died proclaiming his innocence.

309
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:57,493
You believe Burchell do the same thing?

310
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,245
He will not stop running.

311
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:00,745
Until we catch him.

312
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,025
Never heard of him.
You say he lived around here?

313
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:07,714
Well, that's where he's from.

314
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,096
When was the last time you saw him?

315
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:11,308
Two days ago.

316
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:15,688
Look... You must have been tied

317
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:17,843
if he wouldn't mind you
pawing through his gear.

318
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:19,484
We're really sorry about that.

319
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:21,222
We thought this was his boat.

320
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:25,553
People know each other
in a small town like this.

321
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,496
Maybe your friend is from another spot.

322
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:31,716
Are you planning
for an invasion or something?

323
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:35,849
Old habits die hard,
even harder for old marines.

324
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,120
Oh, really? Where'd you serve?

325
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,337
You name it, I probably humped it.

326
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:42,841
Iraq?

327
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,816
First recon...

328
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,327
That's the same as my dad.

329
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:53,204
Well, you don't say.

330
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,277
Ask yourself this.

331
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,239
Do you think that the government
lied to you about your father?

332
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:09,916
- That's different.
- Different how?

333
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,312
He takes the fall
in some friendly fire incident

334
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,893
so some General somewhere
doesn't have to lose his star?

335
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:17,778
He died for a lie.

336
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,195
What are you doing, Will?
You're being a jerk.

337
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,028
Anyway...

338
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,100
One way or another,
one time or another, we all lie.

339
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:29,944
All of us.

340
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,644
<i>We all lie. All of us.</i>

341
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:36,851
Have you been to New Haven...

342
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:38,565
Maybe in the last couple weeks?

343
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,132
You guys don't give up.

344
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:42,341
No, I stay pretty busy right here.

345
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:43,528
Fishing?

346
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:45,578
That's how you make a living
in this town.

347
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,325
Now listen, I gotta make a call.

348
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:51,417
There's beer in the fridge
if you promise to stay out of my stuff.

349
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:53,665
- Thanks a lot, man.
- You got it. Sorry again.

350
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:04,314
- This is not a fishing boat.
- Let's skip the beer.

351
00:24:04,436 --> 00:24:05,468
Good idea.

352
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:15,088
It's locked, man.

353
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:20,567
Yes, sir.

354
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:25,728
<i>Unlock the hatch!</i>

355
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:40,338
Son of a bitch.

356
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:41,869
Son of a bitch!

357
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,412
Get back.

358
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,592
What are you doing?

359
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:46,940
Wait, wait, wait!

360
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:26,926
Let's get out of here.

361
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,515
Wait. Wait. Not yet. Not yet.

362
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,113
I want Taft to think
he finished the job.

363
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:39,676
He's gone.

364
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,539
This is meant merely as an update.

365
00:25:56,738 --> 00:25:58,859
There will be no questions
taken at this time.

366
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,224
I'm special agent in charge
Fred Chambers

367
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,403
of the New York field office of the FBI.

368
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:06,323
Our two suspects
in the Drexler bombing...

369
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:08,318
Jay Burchell and Tyler Fog,

370
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,829
<i>have been positivly IDed
in the New Haven area.</i>

371
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:13,672
<i>Our investigation
has recently uncovered facts</i>

372
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:16,605
<i>that we believe further
implicate Burchell and Fog.</i>

373
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:19,150
<i>Chemical evidence found in New Haven</i>

374
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,707
<i>matches evidence found at the site
of the Drexler bombing.</i>

375
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:23,299
Who cleared this?

376
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:26,874
... possessions that preach
a message of hate

377
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,941
towards President Shears
and the current administration.

378
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,745
He knows we're working that evidence.

379
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,349
It's his call, Marlow.

380
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,423
He's putting conjecture out as fact.

381
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:41,383
Oh, come on. He's the boss.

382
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,737
He needs to give the public something.

383
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:46,248
- People want to see progress.
- I don't approve of this.

384
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:47,485
This is not how it's done.

385
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,716
We can't investigate evidence all day.
We should get out there, find them.

386
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,711
You're siding with Chambers on this?

387
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:58,738
Go work those leads.

388
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:00,853
<i>We appreciate your vigilance.</i>

389
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:02,416
<i>We encourage you to continue</i>

390
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,055
to call our hotline,
as we take every tip seriously.

391
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,371
Thank you very much.

392
00:27:09,264 --> 00:27:11,149
I disseminate information as I see fit.

393
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:13,153
- Yes, sir.
- Chain of command. You remember.

394
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:14,423
My concern is,

395
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:17,093
based on my reservations
on the evidence in those boxes,

396
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,744
I think we're making a mistake
releasing this to the public.

397
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,333
- Is that all?
- This is not my opinion alone, sir.

398
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:42,029
Repeating your history with me
would not be in your best interest.

399
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:45,267
- I was cleared for what happened.
- You went around the chain of command,

400
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:47,622
got soft on a suspect,
and an agent died.

401
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:55,645
We can't just release evidence
to the public

402
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:59,103
to give the illusion of progress.
It could compromise my investigation,

403
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:00,689
and it creates undue fear.

404
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:02,889
Fear is a great motivator, Marlow.

405
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:06,588
If one of those tips leads
to Burchell and Fog's capture,

406
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:08,641
then all your questions
will be answed.

407
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,332
Find them, and then ask the questions.

408
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:41,976
Surprised to see us?

409
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:44,665
- What are you doing here?
- Daniel Taft... you know him.

410
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:47,770
<i>He just tried to kill us in his boat.
Or was that Will's boat, huh?</i>

411
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:01,519
They're listening.
They listen to everything.

412
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:03,230
- Who's "they"?
- We have to go.

413
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:06,701
No, you lied to us once already.
How do we know you're not lying?

414
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:09,411
Your name's Jay Burchell,
you got a 170 on your l.S.A.T.

415
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:11,354
Your favorite team the Chicago Cubs.

416
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:14,277
You wanna know about Will, come with me.
You wanna die, stay here.

417
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Don't move.

418
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:33,510
You're treading
in some deep waters, pal.

419
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:37,773
You.

420
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,135
What do you know about Traveler?

421
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:42,838
We're just supposed
to watch the bookstore.That's it.

422
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:44,051
Keep an eye on the girl.

423
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:45,640
Is Traveler coming here?

424
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:49,311
You're not the only one after him.

425
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:54,010
Look, I don't know
about Traveler, I swear.

426
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:55,736
You're lying.

427
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:08,035
Hold all my calls for one hour.

428
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,421
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>
- What's your 20?

429
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:29,691
<i>We're ten minutes from Deer Harbor.</i>

430
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,529
Tell me about the man on the boat.

431
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:58,599
We told you already.
He said his name's Daniel Taft,

432
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,739
and he blew up the boat with us in it.

433
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,457
Whoever you saw wasn't Daniel Taft.

434
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,516
How do you know?

435
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,305
Because Will was Daniel Taft.

436
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:10,807
At least, that was his name
when I met him.

437
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:15,271
Will wanted us to take
that boat away together.

438
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,124
You and Will were...

439
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,155
He told me about you.

440
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,924
He showed me videos of you guys.
That's how I recognized you.

441
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,494
But you lied to us anyway.

442
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,603
I was hoping you'd just go away,

443
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:29,523
for both of our sakes.

444
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:32,805
She's a terrorist, too.
We've got to get out of here.

445
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:35,332
I'm not a terrorist,
and neither is Will.

446
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,319
Well, then who are you people?

447
00:31:39,301 --> 00:31:41,964
Look, five years ago,

448
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:44,316
my brother was charged
for drug trafficking.

449
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,862
Turns out he's keeping half
of his stash in my store.

450
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,422
I got brought up on charges.

451
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,115
This lawyer comes to me,

452
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:52,087
says he can make it all disappear, if...

453
00:31:52,264 --> 00:31:53,820
I start working for his bosses.

454
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:57,287
I wasn't in a position to refuse.

455
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,547
So Will... is he some kind of spy?

456
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:36,965
He wouldn't tell me anything
when he came here a few years ago.

457
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:41,016
Okay, but I know that he believed
he was serving his country.

458
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,052
It was my job
to help him work on his cover.

459
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:46,183
He was gonna be a student,
say he was from here.

460
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:47,753
When was the last time you saw him?

461
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:48,989
Two weeks ago.

462
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,045
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

463
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:56,779
We don't have a meet scheduled.

464
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,251
I just got my directive.

465
00:32:58,762 --> 00:32:59,784
And?

466
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:01,344
It's time to get out.

467
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:06,209
What's the order?
What is going on, Will?

468
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,850
The room's secure.
What's going on?

469
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:10,173
Job's in two weeks.
The boat will be ready by then.

470
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,805
When I come back here,
we take off, and we're out.

471
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:14,240
No looking back, okay?

472
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:16,861
Maya, we're ready for this.

473
00:33:17,387 --> 00:33:18,487
If you say so.

474
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:19,907
You have to trust me.

475
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:21,837
And what if you don't come back?

476
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:23,572
Then you take the boat,

477
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:25,573
and you go on your own.

478
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:32,425
He never came back.

479
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,264
He hasn't responded to any
of my attempts to contact him.

480
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:37,652
Well, the Drexler was his last job.

481
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,013
He died in the bombing.

482
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,016
I wouldn't be talking to you otherwise.

483
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,396
Despite what you may think,
Will liked you.

484
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:54,671
Well, he talked about you.

485
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:56,915
A rich boy and a soldier's son...

486
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,736
I don't think he understood
the friendship himself.

487
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:00,926
Friendship?

488
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:03,907
He framed us for a terrorist attack.

489
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,094
He was following orders.

490
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,397
It's a friend who watches the store.

491
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,345
Okay. They're coming.

492
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:18,399
Who?

493
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,767
Here? How do we know
you're telling us the truth?

494
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,874
Because I'm done with this life.

495
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:25,825
The people who used Will...

496
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:27,567
they used me, too.

497
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,759
They're the ones responsible
for the Drexler and Will's death.

498
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,714
And even if I can't do anything
about it, you can.

499
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:42,617
Will asked me to keep this for him.

500
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:47,491
- What's it for?
- I don't know, but it's important.

501
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:51,056
Will said that if we ever had to,
it could help us fight back.

502
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:06,812
Who are they?

503
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:08,383
Please, just take the key. Go.

504
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:10,669
- What will they do to you?
- They're not after me.

505
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,962
I'll be fine. Go!

506
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:39,299
We got the girl.
Burchell and Fog got out.

507
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:41,396
<i>Do you want us to pursue?</i>

508
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:44,077
No, stay put.
I have other elements in play.

509
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:45,417
I'll get back to you.

510
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,168
<i>And financial epicenters
has yet to be determined.</i>

511
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,309
<i>Local police and federal agents...</i>

512
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,210
Day and night?

513
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:55,748
My neighbors no longer speak to me.

514
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:57,815
Whole country is going to hell.

515
00:35:58,205 --> 00:35:59,337
Dad, please.

516
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,765
I mean, what kind of man
calls that work?

517
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:03,779
Harassing innocent people.

518
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:05,446
Thank you for that.

519
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,340
I say innocent, I mean you,
not your boyfriend.

520
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:11,252
- You promised.
- All right.

521
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:14,595
Have you got everything?

522
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,598
Just gimme a second.

523
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,605
I'm gonna take this stuff
down to the car.

524
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:48,852
Are you sure we should make this call?

525
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:50,740
You've been dying to do it all day,

526
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:54,002
and, you know, frankly,
I want the FBI up here to look around.

527
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:55,515
Bound to find something.

528
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,071
So make the call, and make it fast,

529
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,049
before these guys recognize us
and try to make some real money.

530
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:08,873
Who is this?

531
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,312
I had to hear your voice.

532
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:16,437
Where are you?

533
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:18,495
I can't say.

534
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:20,936
So are you okay?

535
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:23,315
Jay, why are you still running?

536
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:28,561
It's complicated.

537
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,766
<i>What happenned to that man, up state,</i>

538
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,400
here still people are saying
you killed him.

539
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:36,007
No, he tried to kill us.
We left him alive.

540
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,362
I can't tell you any more.

541
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:42,370
<i>I want to help you.</i>

542
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:45,392
But when you're out there...

543
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:48,720
and people keep dying...

544
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:51,054
It's not like what you're
seeing on the news is true.

545
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,388
Believe me. It's different.

546
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,212
<i>Just tell me. </i>

547
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:57,945
Things are gonna be okay.

548
00:38:01,353 --> 00:38:02,573
You're gonna be fine.

549
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,279
<i>You don't think this phone is tapped?</i>

550
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:17,890
Her dad was there. He hung up.

551
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:22,306
Wait, her dad?
I thought they didn't get along.

552
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:24,061
Yeah, that's exactly why I'm worried.

553
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:29,097
Kim's tough. She'll be all right.

554
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:34,685
I think I hear the train.

555
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,456
Jay, that's... That's my car.

556
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:51,566
That's not your car.
It's a different color.

557
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:55,077
No, that's my car.
Look at the front.

558
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:56,603
The grille is broken.

559
00:38:57,174 --> 00:38:59,129
We're tired. Man, you're seeing things.

560
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:03,524
- All right?
- Yeah, you're right.

561
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:15,419
It's Will. It's Will.

562
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:42,856
Traveler, stay down!
