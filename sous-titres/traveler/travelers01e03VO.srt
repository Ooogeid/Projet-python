1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:02,774
<i>Previously on </i>Traveler...

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:03,914
<i>Three best friends...</i>

3
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:05,148
Go first.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,550
I'll follow taping the whole thing.
Good luck.

5
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:09,281
<i>... And one innocent prank...</i>

6
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:10,415
Hold it!

7
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:12,405
<i>Lead to an unthinkable betrayal...</i>

8
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:15,293
- <i>Did you get out?</i>
- We're at the corner. Where're you?

9
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:21,031
Do you think Will framed us for this?

10
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:22,903
Will apologized right before

11
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,272
the museum exploded,
and our faces are on TV?

12
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,760
We found Traveler in the museum. Dead.

13
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:29,449
Will avoided cameras,

14
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,772
but if you want a picture,
how about this?

15
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,909
I've done as you asked.
They'll be here tonight.

16
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,031
Good.

17
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:37,996
What's Fallbrook Dunn?

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,850
I hired 'em to save your asses.

19
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:41,665
You leave the country immediately.

20
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,833
Watch out.

21
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,937
Stay out of sight. I'll handle this.

22
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:48,405
Go!

23
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:56,786
Who hired you?

24
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:58,221
My father knows about this?

25
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:00,168
Your father is the least
of your worries.

26
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:06,056
New York field office.

27
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:07,906
Sir, you need to contact
Chicago.

28
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,550
I'm afraid Los Angeles is outside
our current search radius.

29
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,202
What do we got?

30
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:14,533
Upstate New York.

31
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:16,439
Franklin
county sheriff sent these images.

32
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,595
Partial prints suggest Fog
was the driver.

33
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:21,410
Franklin county... That's where
Marlow and Borjes are headed.

34
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:23,173
If our suspects are still in the area,

35
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,138
they'll be looking for food,
clothing, transportation.

36
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,805
Let's think, people.
Where would these guys go?

37
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,585
- What about Traveler?
- Nada. No pictures, no IDs.

38
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,279
- A ghost.
- Franklin county Sheriff's

39
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,162
reporting a murder, sir.
Tolman airfield.

40
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:54,850
How close is that to the Fog estate?

41
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,913
- It's less than 2 miles.
I don't believe in coincidences.

42
00:01:58,096 --> 00:01:59,824
Tell Franklin county I'm on route.

43
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,138
How much for the jeans?

44
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:23,266
<i>... update on the Drexler museum
bombing.</i>

45
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:24,929
<i>Authorities now feel certain</i>

46
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,103
<i>suspects, Fog and Burchell,
remained in the New York area.</i>

47
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,121
<i>If you have seen these two suspects...</i>

48
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:32,430
I know, man.
I've been getting that all day.

49
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,440
I look like that guy, right?

50
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:37,753
Will 40 bucks cover it?

51
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,246
- Yeah. You want a bag?
- No, thanks.

52
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,427
I got one already.

53
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,003
How much evidence do you think
they contaminated?

54
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,766
Don't get cocky. These locals were
on the scene 1 hour before us.

55
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:06,575
They must be doing something right.

56
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,544
- Can I help you two?
- Special agent Marlow,

57
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,335
- New York office. This is agent Borjes.
- Oh, right. Deputy Sheriff Roach.

58
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,775
Deceased's name is Jon Ellington.

59
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,536
Worked for a crisis management firm
out of Washington.

60
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:19,678
We understand he was on retainer
to Carlton Fog?

61
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,843
Yep. And according to
the prints we found inside,

62
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,867
he was here with
Jay Burchell and Tyler Fog.

63
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,057
Nice work.

64
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:31,711
We have to go!

65
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:34,884
What the hell are you doing?

66
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,020
Changing my hair.

67
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:38,896
"Auburn sun"?

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,041
- You gonna be a redhead now?
- That's all they had at the store.

69
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:45,278
If we need to stay inconspicuous,
we don't walk around with bad dye jobs

70
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:47,352
and haircuts that make us
look like criminals.

71
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,637
We have to be smart!

72
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:51,412
Housekeeping!

73
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,168
Yeah, can you please come back?

74
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:56,366
Office said you checked out already.

75
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,561
Yeah, but I haven't packed yet.

76
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,601
- Could you please just come back?
- Okay.

77
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:08,580
<i>And we have breaking news just in,</i>

78
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:11,205
<i>Police have discovered the body
of a man bound</i>

79
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:14,169
<i>and gagged inside a hangar
at Tolman airfield today...</i>

80
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,016
We left Ellington alive this morning.

81
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:18,138
We didn't kill him.

82
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,183
And we didn't blow up
the Drexler, either.

83
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:24,316
He tried to kill us,

84
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,391
and then he ends up dead.
What does that mean?

85
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:27,933
It means we need to keep moving.

86
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:35,873
Maybe the hair dye
wasn't such a bad idea.

87
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,165
Have you seen a wound like this before?

88
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:46,287
Sure.

89
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,916
What do you mean, "sure"?

90
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:51,199
Slow bleeding kill shot, femoral artery.

91
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:53,038
Saw a couple in Iraq.

92
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,099
It's an insurgency torture technique.

93
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,373
Not the kind of thing
you learn in the ivy league.

94
00:05:57,528 --> 00:05:59,976
Burchell was ROTC,
his father's faithful icon.

95
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,637
These guys invented stuff like that.

96
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,548
Maybe, but is that the kind
of thing you teach your kid?

97
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:05,786
Agent Marlow?

98
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,789
Burchell's been spotted
in a black sedan.

99
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,912
- Where?
Roadside motel,
half-hour south.

100
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,102
Half-hour?

101
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,056
What do you say we close that gap?

102
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,118
FBI! Everyone down!

103
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,245
Clear!

104
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:22,934
It's empty.

105
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:24,816
Damn it!

106
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,992
Car's clear.
Hasn't been driven for hours!

107
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,620
They're running up their lead.

108
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:36,227
Tell New York that our suspects'
descriptions have changed.

109
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,069
So you think they'll really buy it?

110
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:47,293
That we dyed our hair
and changed our look?

111
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,580
That's the first thing
you learn in law school...

112
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:52,244
Play to the jury's expectations,
they'll believe every word.

113
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,651
You know, I think we're going
in the wrong direction.

114
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,537
Yeah, we're... We're heading south, Jay.

115
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:08,144
The border's that way!

116
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:09,714
We're not going to Canada.

117
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,173
What do you want to do?
Go back to New York

118
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:13,393
Sign some autographs?

119
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,121
We tried your way, Tyler.
It almost got us killed.

120
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:19,142
So are you blaming me
for what happened?

121
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,193
- No.
- Then who? My dad?

122
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,307
We're going back to Yale.

123
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,287
No. That's suicide.

124
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:27,966
No way am I going back there.

125
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,729
- You have a better idea?
- Yeah! I do.

126
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,743
It's about 70 miles north from here!

127
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,214
It's got good beer, bacon
and way fewer guns, Jay!

128
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:37,988
They sent a man to kill us!

129
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,369
I'm not saying your dad knew
about Ellington.

130
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:45,795
But whoever sent him, whoever
he and Will were working for,

131
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,709
do you think they're gonna be stopped
by matters of jurisdiction?

132
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:50,690
- I'm not going back, Jay.
- Why not?

133
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,949
New Haven will be crawling with cops!

134
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:55,281
So Will every border crossing
into Canada.

135
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,535
That's why we're going back
to where this all started,

136
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:04,068
and New Haven is the only place to find
hard evidence that Will ever existed.

137
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:07,010
That's the first step
to clearing our names.

138
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:12,951
<i>Thanks, Jack.</i>

139
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,149
<i>I'm standing outside the home
of Kim Doherty,</i>

140
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:19,039
<i>reputed to be the girlfriend
of Drexler bombing suspect Jay Burchell.</i>

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,378
<i>Doherty moved to Manhattan
six months ago,</i>

142
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,100
<i>where she and the suspect
were often seen together.</i>

143
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,593
<i>Needless to say,
the question on everyone's mind</i>

144
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,404
<i>is whether or not Kim Doherty
knew of yesterday's events</i>

145
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:30,785
<i>before they happened.</i>

146
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:32,930
<i>Michelle, have authorities
mentioned any idea</i>

147
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:35,328
<i>whether Ms. Doherty
is a suspect in the case?</i>

148
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,510
<i>No, jack, police won't confirm anything.</i>

149
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,922
<i>Neighbors, however, do say
she has been questioned by the FBI.</i>

150
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,450
She's not answering.

151
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:46,416
You want me to have our men
keep the paparazzi off her?

152
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:52,277
Ms. Doherty should get used
to her celebrity status.

153
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:53,948
- Sir?
- Walk with me.

154
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,749
We interviewed the staff,
gone over the room.

155
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,714
We think Burchell and Fog left
a little less than an hour ago.

156
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,087
The county's fully mobilized,
but it's not much.

157
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,525
And the body at the airfield?

158
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:05,339
He worked for a firm in Washington, D.C.

159
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,934
He was hired by Carlton Fog.

160
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,772
Sir, we found their old
clothes in a dumpster out back.

161
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,836
So they changed
their clothes and their look.

162
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,800
Our suspects are starting to adapt.

163
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,777
I want every cop in the county
watching the Canadian border.

164
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:21,243
Get me mock-ups of Burchell and Fog's
potential new look,

165
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,066
and get me as much press here
as possible.

166
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,193
You want press, sir?

167
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,268
If Burchell and Fog
are making a run for Canada,

168
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,316
I'm gonna make sure
everybody knows about it.

169
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:35,515
If we steal a car, it's best to pick
one that won't be missed for a while.

170
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:37,172
Wait, you've stolen a car?

171
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:40,199
Yeah, it was kind of a rite of passage
where I grew up.

172
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:42,581
- Yeah, I'm impressed, Jay.
- Don't be.

173
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,829
I went to Yale to get away
from stuff like this.

174
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,748
It's another one heading north.

175
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,650
You were right on that call.

176
00:09:56,384 --> 00:09:58,372
All right, this one looks good.

177
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:02,760
- What are you doing?
- We smash the window.

178
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:04,659
9 times out of 10,
the owner leaves the key

179
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,679
- in the glove compartment.
- Wait.

180
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,404
Nine times out of ten,
cars like these are left unlocked.

181
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:18,153
It's easier to get blue book value
from the insurance company.

182
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:22,931
- Oh, yes. That was the easy part.
- What's the hard part?

183
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,053
New Haven.

184
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:35,294
Subtitles: swsub.com

185
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:42,512
We're still on course. This is working.

186
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,558
Where are we with the damage assessment?

187
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:46,126
I took care of Ellington.

188
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:48,484
I don't mean Ellington.

189
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,164
I'm still getting reports
from the Drexler, but

190
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,792
right now we can assume that everything
in the museum has been taken care of.

191
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:56,598
- The entire collection?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,382
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

193
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,575
Knowing that Burchell and Fog
have altered their appearance,

194
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,176
our forensic artists have created

195
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:11,145
these mock-ups of possible new looks.

196
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,454
I think boss likes talking
to them more than us.

197
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:14,576
'course he does.

198
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,839
With us, he doesn't get
to see himself on tv later.

199
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,641
We found their prints
at the crime scene.

200
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,320
So until we rule out their involvement,
Burchell and Fog

201
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:24,327
should be considered
armed and dangerous. Thank you.

202
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:30,368
Carlton Fog is being brought
into New York.

203
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,208
I'm going there now to question him.

204
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:35,018
I want you 2 to head north
and help oversee the border operation.

205
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,563
- Actually, sir...
- Yes, agent Marlow.

206
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,691
I'd like permission
to pursue another course of action.

207
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,914
You have a better idea?

208
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:44,721
Just a different one.
We're working off a nascent profile,

209
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,496
but if they were running for the border,

210
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,328
why drive south from the airport?

211
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,836
They could have turned around.

212
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,141
Then why take the time
to color and cut their hair?

213
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,642
We all know that every second counts
for a fugitive.

214
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:57,816
They would have been better off
going straight for Canada.

215
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:59,138
Interesting theory.

216
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,331
If they head south,
where are they going?

217
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:04,725
I think they're running scared.
And if they don't flee the country,

218
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,304
they're gonna be looking for shelter
with friends, family,

219
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:08,507
whoever they can trust.

220
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,460
Maybe back to New York,
another Fog house.

221
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,482
We have units covering those, so...

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,828
I'd like permission to go to New Haven.

223
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:19,255
You think they would be crazy enough
to go back there?

224
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:20,494
Even if I'm wrong,

225
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:23,642
at least we'll get more interviews
and help build a profile.

226
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:28,873
What's your feeling?

227
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:34,621
Don't know, sir, but I think

228
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:37,944
we're more effective on the move
than sitting at a border crossing.

229
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:45,286
You've got 24 hours.

230
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,762
Events such as those
of the past 36 hours

231
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,661
remind us
that it's become increasingly difficult

232
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,507
to offer protection and solace
to those that we hold dear.

233
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:04,997
I'm being called into the fbi today
because I was contacted by my son,

234
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:08,812
in the hours following the bombing
of the Drexler museum.

235
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,765
<i>- Tyler sounded distraught...</i>
- That's my dad.

236
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:14,314
<i>He professed his innocence,
and I did what I believe</i>

237
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:16,487
<i>any father would do...
I asked him to come home.</i>

238
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:20,036
My hope was
that I could persuade them

239
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:22,011
to turn themselves in
to the authorities...

240
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:26,215
- You still believe him now?
- He's saying that because he has to.

241
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:29,305
He can't admit that he tried to help us.

242
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:31,286
<i>And although a man ended up dead,</i>

243
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:33,384
I Will say this...

244
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:38,215
I still believe that my son
is innocent of this crime,

245
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,114
just as I am sure he is innocent

246
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:43,625
of the bombing of the Drexler museum.

247
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,015
If you can hear me, if you're there,

248
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:52,473
<i>I want you to know
that I am here to help you,</i>

249
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,870
<i>and I Will do everything
in my power to make sure</i>

250
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,306
<i>that you get a fair trial,
and that you are...</i>

251
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:00,533
- What the hell?!
- He's saying that to protect himself.

252
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,745
Look, I'm only gonna say this once.

253
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,869
But you wouldn't have lived
in that house with us

254
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,780
if your father hadn't cut you off.

255
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,930
Do you call that loyalty?

256
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:11,839
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

257
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,243
Fine. But as long
as we're sticking together,

258
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:16,681
your father is not an option.

259
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,621
Yeah, then, what's the plan?

260
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,278
Will and I left some boxes
at a friend's house.

261
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,303
They had his chemistry work, clothing...

262
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:28,790
- Things we can take to the feds.
- Why didn't I know about this?

263
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,928
Because we left 'em at Nell's.

264
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,685
This just gets better and better.

265
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:36,745
Whatever happened
between you and Nell,

266
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:39,402
it's way less important
than what we'll find.

267
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,656
Kim, tell us about your boyfriend.

268
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,682
How long you been with a guy like Jay?

269
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:10,682
Hi, Roger.

270
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,665
- I tried to call you.
- Sorry. I had to turn my cell off.

271
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:19,678
Every tv station and newspaper
in town has been calling.

272
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:23,232
- Kind of nice to have work to run to.
- Yeah, about that...

273
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,079
I'm not firing you.
Once this whole thing gets resolved...

274
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,265
- Right
- It's just not the kind of publicity

275
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,051
we need for the gallery right now.

276
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,159
Well, I've got your stuff inside.

277
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,526
And I need your key.

278
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,282
Right.

279
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,910
I got it.

280
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:15,449
Come on, Will.

281
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:20,705
Come on!

282
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,201
- There's gotta be one!
- It's okay. We'll keep looking.

283
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,160
How do you live with somebody
for 2 years

284
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:28,022
and not have a single picture of them?

285
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:11,566
All right. Hurry it up.

286
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:14,006
I've already counted five cops
since we got to town.

287
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:17,022
Yeah, we'll just grab Will's stuff
and get out of here.

288
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:25,082
So did Nell ever ask
why I wasn't storing boxes with her?

289
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:28,584
She was more interested
in why you left without calling.

290
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,008
All right.

291
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,732
Look for Will's notes, chemistry papers,

292
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:36,519
housing records,
anything that proves he existed.

293
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,440
What the hell?

294
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:47,629
What's up?

295
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:50,246
Will labeled all his boxes.
They're not here.

296
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:53,007
- Maybe Nell moved 'em.
- No, they're not here.

297
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:54,129
How could that be?

298
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,554
We only dropped 'em off three days ago.

299
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,878
That's all the time they needed...
To set us up.

300
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,628
What are those?

301
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:13,064
Floor plans...

302
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:14,939
for the Drexler.

303
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,680
There's printouts on explosives...

304
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,768
Blast patterns...

305
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,831
Casualty estimates.

306
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:33,248
They didn't take Will's stuff.
They just made it look like it was mine.

307
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,762
This is Will's
chemical engineering research,

308
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:37,475
and it's in my handwriting.

309
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,703
Here's, like, a hundred pages
about how the government

310
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:44,614
is no longer on the side of the people,
and we need to fight back.

311
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,764
What kind of person
can pull such a thing off?

312
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,043
Someone who knew
our stuff was down here.

313
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:53,759
Will's dead.

314
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,140
- What about Nell?
- Come on, Jay. We know her.

315
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,887
All I'm saying is anyone
could be involved with this.

316
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,009
With what?

317
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:11,015
Don't worry.
If I really thought you were terrorists,

318
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,084
I would have called the cops already.

319
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,808
What happened to our stuff?

320
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:23,508
- What are you talking about?
- Someone switched out our things.

321
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,250
Did you know about it?

322
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:27,630
- And your roommates?
- They left last week.

323
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:30,444
- I'm the only one that stayed...
- You're sure no one else knew

324
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,834
- about these boxes?
- Yeah, Jay. I'm sure.

325
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,586
She didn't know about it.
We got in. So could anybody else.

326
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,486
- And besides, I know when she's lying.
- How?

327
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,086
Because she didn't do it
until we started dating.

328
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:00,181
You think it's too late
to go back to school?

329
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:02,182
You better put those feelings on hold,

330
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:05,074
'cause this is who we're gonna be
spending the next 24 hours with...

331
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:08,160
Burchell and Fog's
known friends, lovers and acquaintances.

332
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:11,118
It's gonna be a good day.

333
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:43,310
Anyone ask you
if you'd like anything to drink?

334
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,719
They did...

335
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:46,675
40 minutes ago.

336
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,590
The fact that it never came,
I assume, is part of your strategy

337
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,290
to make me feel uneasy, right?

338
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,465
As are the camera and the recording
equipment in the next room.

339
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,607
Are you uneasy, Mr. Fog?

340
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:00,379
I'm simply concerned.

341
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,025
As you should be.

342
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:06,122
<i>What were you trying to do
with your son yesterday?</i>

343
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:08,061
- What I thought best.
- Really?

344
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,518
Because you know
what it looked like to me?

345
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,466
It looked like you were messing
with a federal investigation...

346
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:17,089
Getting involved in something
you should not be getting involved in.

347
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,158
Tyler is my son.

348
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,901
It's a little late to play the
concerned father card, don't you think?

349
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,792
You have children, agent Chambers,
don't you?

350
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,606
A daughter, right?

351
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,604
Now how would you react
if something were to happen to her...

352
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:33,833
Listen to me.

353
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:37,840
The only reason that I have not booked
you for obstructing justice...

354
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,821
... Is because you can't.

355
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,797
It's because
you're more use to me out of jail.

356
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:44,833
Tyler might try and contact you.

357
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,810
But I want to make one thing clear.

358
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:50,138
It is my job to bring your son in,

359
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,385
and if you get in the way of that,

360
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,247
there Will be consequences.

361
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,463
Maybe I should have brought my lawyer.

362
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,898
Do you know where your son
and his friend are?

363
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,211
You get a call from them
in one of your many houses,

364
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:07,735
I want to hear about it.

365
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:10,659
You wake up with an idea
of where they might be,

366
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:13,276
I want to know about it.

367
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,456
This must be hard for you.

368
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:24,469
I'm sure you're...

369
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:27,063
You're under a tremendous pressure

370
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:29,472
from your superiors
to wrap this case up.

371
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:31,151
Nothing I can't manage.

372
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,528
Or middle manange, as the case may be.

373
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:36,803
You have a good day.

374
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,516
- Sorry, miss. I didn't see you.
- No, it's my fault.

375
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:30,501
- What about the rest of the stuff?
- We ditch it.

376
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:32,206
Trash doesn't come until tuesday.

377
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:33,914
That's not fast enough.

378
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,268
But...

379
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:40,012
this might be.

380
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:43,295
All right. Pack up the rest
of the stuff. I'll start the grill.

381
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,199
Tyler, let's go.

382
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,346
I thought you could use these.
You know, blend in.

383
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,516
We're okay.

384
00:23:58,441 --> 00:23:59,635
I'm only trying to help you...

385
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:01,687
I don't have a lot of time for this.
Okay?

386
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,998
Hey, you ran from here last week.

387
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:05,775
You couldn't leave on that trip soon...

388
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,134
I didn't like this place
when we were going to school.

389
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,710
People have expectations
about who I am,

390
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,400
you know, what I could do for them.

391
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:19,115
Do you still think I only dated you
because of your father?

392
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:21,662
Well, when you applied
for job at his company,

393
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:23,427
things just got a little confusing.

394
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:25,984
- You told me you were cool with that.
- But,

395
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,605
I became part
of the interview process, didn't I?

396
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:38,122
Look at me.

397
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,446
Do you think
I'd be helping you right now

398
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:43,023
if it was just about a job?

399
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,111
- Hold on.
- No. Stay here.

400
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:20,550
- Stay here.
- I don't know. That was Will.

401
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:28,057
He's got a carrel down here?

402
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,015
I didn't get you through
that investment class

403
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:37,381
so you could come down here
and hang out with Will.

404
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,864
Well, since my stock is rising...

405
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:48,951
<i>He's got a carrel down here?</i>

406
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,845
There's one more place
to look for evidence on Will.

407
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:02,145
- Where?
- He had a carrel

408
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,518
at the cross campus library.

409
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:06,113
Engineers don't have offices there.
Are you sure?

410
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:20,970
How long ago? All right. Thanks.

411
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:23,689
You have to go.
The cops are questioning

412
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,890
everyone who knew you,
and my name is on the list.

413
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:27,801
Let's go, man.

414
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:35,337
Sorry we dragged you into this.

415
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:38,358
When they get here,
just exercise your right to an attorney,

416
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:40,362
and when a lawyer arrives,
you tell the truth.

417
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:43,340
You came home, found us looking
through the boxes. That's all you say.

418
00:26:44,508 --> 00:26:45,509
One last thing.

419
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:48,514
When things settle down,
can you contact Kim for me?

420
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:51,552
Just tell her I'm okay,
and I'll be in touch as soon as I can.

421
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:52,798
Thank you.

422
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,249
Wait...

423
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,364
what should I tell them about your hair?

424
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:02,463
Last time I checked,
you were supposed to be a red head.

425
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,317
Well, like Jay said...

426
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,375
I was wearing a hat,
and then I ran from you.

427
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:24,868
- Nell Gaham?
- That's me.

428
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,074
I'm special agent Marlow with the FBI.

429
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:29,607
We're investigating
the Drexler bombing in New York.

430
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:31,027
I'd like a lawyer present.

431
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,237
Excuse me?

432
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:35,237
I'd like to have a lawyer present
before I answer any more questions.

433
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:36,549
Something's burning.

434
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:38,216
Around back.

435
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:42,371
Out here!

436
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,568
Get on the radio.

437
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,754
They're here.

438
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,037
We got over a hundred New York
and Connecticut officers coming in.

439
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:07,348
- They won't get outta this city.
- Never say never.

440
00:28:07,976 --> 00:28:09,111
Anything from the girl?

441
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,021
She's staying silent
until her lawyer arrives.

442
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,567
Maybe she's in on it.

443
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:22,499
Or maybe she's just trying
to buy Burchell and Fog some time.

444
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,354
We're pushing it.

445
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:33,005
Don't worry.
If things get bad, I got an out.

446
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,689
- This is the floor.
- Are you sure?

447
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,364
Yeah. Art history.

448
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:17,505
Nell had a thing for Botticelli.

449
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,951
Okay, we were over there,
which means that Will...

450
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:24,840
was down here.

451
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,588
Where are you going? Exit this way.

452
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:33,397
Will went that way.
I was thinking we could surprise him.

453
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,569
- Come on.
- I know he's your friend and all,

454
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,456
but he's kind of always
given me the creeps.

455
00:29:39,672 --> 00:29:41,711
Please? Come on.
Let's not and say we did.

456
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,710
Come on.

457
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:53,158
<i>He's kind of always
given me the creeps.</i>

458
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:55,878
- Is this it?
- I don't know. This place is a maze.

459
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:58,569
Wait. Yeah, this is it.

460
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:02,015
He used a... A map to, like,
cover the window.

461
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,897
- But it's locked.
- Not for long.

462
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:11,901
I want to be on with
the New Haven field office in five,

463
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:13,932
and get the live feed up
in the strategy room.

464
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:15,087
Yes, sir.

465
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:19,556
Ms. Doherty, what brings you here today?

466
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,549
You finally decided to help us?

467
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,550
I'm here to help Jay and Tyler.

468
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,782
I'll take it from here.

469
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,263
I found a photograph of Will
with Jay and Tyler.

470
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,835
That could help, right?

471
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,264
It wouldn't hurt, but...

472
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:35,300
I was fired today.
Well, not fired, exactly.

473
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:37,727
But, uh, it was a rough day to start.

474
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:39,755
I've been hounded by photographers,

475
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,269
I'm on the news, and then
there it was, right in front of me.

476
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,815
They're not here.

477
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:53,216
- The pictures?
- Yes,

478
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,085
the pictures. That's why I came here.

479
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,752
Maybe you left them at your apartment.

480
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:58,833
I just had them developed.

481
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:03,942
All right. You're distraught.
I understand.

482
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:05,270
Why don't you take a seat...

483
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:12,728
<i>Sorry, miss. I didn't see you.</i>

484
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:16,630
That man.

485
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,393
There's a man
who bumped into me at the store.

486
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:21,927
He could have taken them.
That's who we need to find.

487
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:26,278
All right. Now this man
who bumped into you...

488
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:28,449
did he somehow reach into your purse?

489
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,923
I don't know. We...

490
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,358
You don't believe me.

491
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:40,625
I'm not saying that.

492
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:42,564
You don't have to.

493
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:54,310
There's nothing in there.

494
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,649
The rest are empty, too.

495
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:58,400
They must have been cleaned out
when people left.

496
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:00,216
We don't have time to relax. Come on.

497
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:02,895
I know I didn't want to come back,

498
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:05,303
but we cannot leave until
we've exhausted all the options.

499
00:32:05,404 --> 00:32:06,834
I know, but we've looked everywhere.

500
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:08,823
Maybe we need to look
at things a little...

501
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,063
differently.

502
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:14,004
Why would somebody stand up there?

503
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:16,718
Wait a second.

504
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:30,795
You were right.

505
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:35,088
There's gotta be...

506
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,661
$10,000 in here.

507
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:39,273
What's that?

508
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:40,525
A train schedule.

509
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:43,096
North from New Haven.

510
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:48,084
Deer Harbor.
He's marked trains to Deer Harbor.

511
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:49,423
Yeah, that's where he's from,

512
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,076
But my... My dad said
there's no listing for him in Maine.

513
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:54,239
Yeah. It doesn't mean
he hasn't been there.

514
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:55,975
Hey, check out this code.

515
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:01,392
You think this was some kind
of stash point?

516
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:03,881
Why leave it?

517
00:33:06,142 --> 00:33:08,300
Maybe he thought
he'd make it out of the Drexler alive

518
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:09,754
and come back for it.

519
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:30,802
I guess there's some people
you just never really know.

520
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:32,526
Drop your weapon, Fog!

521
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:41,623
Put it down!

522
00:33:57,794 --> 00:33:59,913
We got 'em on level one.
Seal the exits.

523
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:36,775
I think they went down.

524
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,472
Two of you with us.
The rest cover every stairwell up.

525
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:47,936
I told you I had an out.

526
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:57,016
This is the bottom floor.
Nowhere to go.

527
00:34:57,986 --> 00:34:59,604
Jay Burchell and Tyler Fog,

528
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:02,301
this is special agent Marlow
of the FBI.

529
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,061
I want to talk.

530
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,336
Wait!

531
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,937
- In here.
- What is this?

532
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:18,873
Clear.

533
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,381
They gotta be here somewhere.

534
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:31,419
Let's tear this place apart.

535
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:36,000
I told you I had an out.

536
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,691
- Are these the steam tunnels?
- Yeah. Come on.

537
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,074
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

538
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:02,694
Stop it.

539
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,216
Would you people just leave me alone?!

540
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,537
- Take it easy.
- Just stop it!

541
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:12,457
Back off. I'm with the "Post."

542
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:15,442
Not the camera.

543
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:19,872
You're a lunatic, lady.
I'm calling the cops.

544
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,174
I'm pressing charges!

545
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:45,788
- So how far did we go?
- About a quarter of a mile.

546
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:47,445
We just went under the whole campus.

547
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:48,780
How the hell did you find'em?

548
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:51,199
I used them to break into
the library during off hours,

549
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,645
- among other things.
- Are you kidding me?

550
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,805
Your obsessive study habits
just saved our ass, pal.

551
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:13,781
How long?

552
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:16,715
According to the schedule, the next
train for Deer Harbor leaves in...

553
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,133
less than ten minutes. Come on.

554
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:19,653
Wait, wait.

555
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,456
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm bummed we're leaving.

556
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,130
We'll be back.

557
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:46,767
The negatives are inside.

558
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:49,387
Photos courtesy of Kim Doherty.

559
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:55,324
Does Ms. Doherty
have any more pictures of Traveler?

560
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,934
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

561
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,398
It seems Traveler
has left us quite a mess.

562
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,291
You know what to do.

563
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:24,302
Well...

564
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,427
Excuse us.

565
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:39,074
This was destroyed
in the Drexler bombing.

566
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,616
I can't move this.

567
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:43,625
I'm not looking to sell it.

568
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:45,461
Then what do you want?

569
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,498
I want to know what I have.
