00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:22,372
Hey! Slow down!

3
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,219
Will!

4
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:37,557
Will, you're in here?

5
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:43,547
<i>We're still waiting for a report</i>

6
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,695
<i>on casualties
and details are hard to come by,</i>

7
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:48,076
<i>- but police are not ruling out...</i>
- Jay!

8
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,591
<i>Two men were seen fleeing the scene.</i>

9
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:53,164
<i>- Thank you, Heather.</i>
- She's talking about us.

10
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:55,187
<i>Your call cannot be completed
as dialed...</i>

11
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:57,298
- She's talking about us, Jay!
- I know, Tyler!

12
00:00:58,674 --> 00:00:59,674
I think I'm gonna puke.

13
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,279
- Where the hell is Will?
- He's dead!

14
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,328
We don't know that.

15
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,133
- He was in there!
- We don't know that!

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,247
We haven't done anything wrong.

17
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:09,877
So let's just take a breath
and go to the police, okay?

18
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,540
They can handle this.

19
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:26,913
- A guide book.
- Guide book?

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,916
Jack Kerouac wrote the great
American novel in less than 3 weeks.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,365
The guy didn't need to invent

22
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:34,747
the adventures of Dean Moriarty
and Sal Paradise.

23
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:35,908
He lived them.

24
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,727
They teach that at chemical engineering?

25
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:41,121
I'm not a chemical engineer
for the next two months.

26
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:44,261
And you are not a venture capitalist.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,605
And you are definitely not a lawyer.

28
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:47,833
For the next two months,

29
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:51,779
we are professional vagabonds,
Moriarty and Paradise,

30
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,642
living between the East of our youth...

31
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:55,899
- and the West of our future.
- Exactly.

32
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,897
- That's from the book.
- Yeah. Right. I know.

33
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:04,342
Well, looks like
it's time to say goodbye to the Castle.

34
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:07,374
Shotgun!

35
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:11,768
You suck!

36
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:14,890
Every damn time...

37
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:22,083
What, are we 12 years old or what?
Come on.

38
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:23,246
We're good.

39
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:28,484
Quit playing games.

40
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:45,773
Welcome to New York.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,111
You booked us here?

42
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,438
It's our last night to live like kings.

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,865
After this,
it's all motels and camps all the way

44
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,123
- to San Francisco.
- Catch!

45
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,299
You guys check in.
I'm gonna go park the car.

46
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:00,372
They've got valet.

47
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,353
I know a garage in 51st.
It's half the price.

48
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,311
I'll meet you guys up in the room.

49
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,299
Are you gentlemen in town
for business or pleasure?

50
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:11,457
Definitely pleasure.

51
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:14,229
You're on a road trip?

52
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:16,731
I can tell by the bags.

53
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,878
I like to guess where folks are headed
based on their luggage.

54
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,147
- It's a cool trick.
- Yep.

55
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:25,051
And we plan to start this trip off
with a bang.

56
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:28,861
So, if you could arrange a limo for us
this evening, we'd be in your debt.

57
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,433
Of course, sir.

58
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,804
Concierge will have a car waiting.

59
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,022
Thanks.

60
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,725
You don't have to pay
for everything on this trip.

61
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,675
We said Will
would be in charge of planning,

62
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:47,296
I would cover major expenses
and you will keep us out of trouble.

63
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:48,938
Of the three....

64
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,944
I'd say you have the hardest job.

65
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,652
Wake up, Jay! It's just the beginning.

66
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,002
Suit yourselves, ladies.
Go ahead.

67
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,707
Hey, act like you're having fun.

68
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:11,616
You take that thing
everywhere on this trip?

69
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:13,253
You'll thank me for this someday.

70
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:15,282
Excuse me. Ladies,

71
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:17,598
we didn't come to the most exclusive
club in Manhattan

72
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,869
for you to play wallflower, ok?

73
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,983
Now, I've got 3 interns from Vogue
over there looking for dance partners.

74
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:24,761
But if we don't act fast,
they'll gonna be taken off the market.

75
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,375
Hey man, some of us have girlfriends.

76
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,940
No. You, Jay, have a girlfriend,

77
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,305
but if you take advantage
of your time with me tonight,

78
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,042
We might just make that girlfriends.

79
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,431
Careful Tyler!

80
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:37,679
Give it back, man.

81
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,098
Hey, hon, Jay will call you back...

82
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:45,838
in like 2 months.

83
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,506
- Why?
- I'm just looking out for you.

84
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:51,453
We'll be there in a minute. One minute.

85
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:53,096
I'll be waiting.

86
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,556
It's the 3rd time
she's called you tonight.

87
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,926
Doesn't want you to go?

88
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:04,198
She's not the only one
having second thoughts.

89
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,077
Got to see the world before
you can change it, right?

90
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,678
Yeah, I've also to pay
80,000 in loans, too.

91
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Jay, come on, look.

92
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,298
You're doing the right thing, here.
A trip like this,

93
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,235
you take time to step off the path

94
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:19,490
and really see
what makes this country tick.

95
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,151
It'll change your life.

96
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,542
- Alright?
- Alright.

97
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:26,997
Good. Now,

98
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,942
you do whatever damage control
you need to do,

99
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,286
and you come out here

100
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:33,850
and get your groove on.

101
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:36,839
Can I see that move again?

102
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,480
- It's call fun.
- You are so horribly white.

103
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,566
Wake up call!

104
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,191
Rise and shine,
we've got a lot to do today.

105
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:01,599
If you're done,

106
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,478
I've an unforgettable way
to start our trip.

107
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,834
Will, can I just say how proud of you
I am right now?

108
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:20,367
Rumor is Kerouac
streaked this place back in 47

109
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:22,278
as a "screw you"
to New York establishment.

110
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,330
This is genius.

111
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:25,971
My grandma used to drag me here
like once a month.

112
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:27,423
I figure we race from the top,

113
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:30,082
whoever gets out first
doesn't drive till Chicago.

114
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:31,702
Like that med-school prank?

115
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,751
It was 2 years ago.

116
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:36,444
Here we go again.

117
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,978
Look, you said it was my job
to keep us out of trouble, all right?

118
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,933
Things are a little different now.
We're not in grad school anymore.

119
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:44,055
Jay, it's a prank.

120
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,992
So what if we get
in a little bit of trouble?

121
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:48,826
Tyler, there's a difference between
getting hired by a major law firm

122
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,577
and going to work for your dad.

123
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,389
You know what, Jay?

124
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:54,532
Wake up.

125
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,161
Cause that law firm is gonna run
your life in about 2 months.

126
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,240
And this trip is your last chance
to actually have a little bit of fun.

127
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:02,296
No, and actually do something memorable.

128
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,084
If we do this thing,
we're gonna do it together,

129
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:06,920
we said that from day one in this trip.

130
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:09,710
- So you're putting this on me, now.
- If you're out, we all are.

131
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:15,984
I win, Tyler keeps his mouth shut
about Kim for the rest of the trip.

132
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:18,711
Oh, it is on, my friend,
it is on!

133
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,493
Let's go!

134
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:29,985
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

135
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:34,141
<i>the special Docents tour
will be beginning in five minutes.</i>

136
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,492
I haven't done this since hockey season.

137
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:58,066
Don't make excuses.
It's like riding a bike.

138
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,375
OK. You guys head down first, I'll be
right behind you taping the whole thing.

139
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,464
And if we get split up?

140
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:04,474
We meet outside North/East corner.

141
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:05,989
Amen.

142
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,298
Good luck.

143
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:56,709
Sorry.

144
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:58,832
What happened, man?

145
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:02,035
- Where is Will?
- You two!

146
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:03,278
Hold it!

147
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:08,120
- Go. Let's go!
- <i>Attention, this is a fire alarm.</i>

148
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:11,904
<i>Please follow a docent
or a security guard to the nearest exit.</i>

149
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:16,070
No, you can't do that in here!

150
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,170
Coming through! Thank you,
thank you guys! Sorry!

151
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,489
- This was not bad.
- Not bad!

152
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:54,299
By the way,
you're driving to Chi-town.

153
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,238
- No, there was blatant interference.
- I was first to the door.

154
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:58,631
- Calling Will?
- Yeah.

155
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:01,693
<i>Did you get out?</i>

156
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:03,824
<i>- Did you get out?</i>
- Yeah, we're at the corner.

157
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:04,847
Where are you?

158
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:09,732
- I'm sorry I had to do this.
- Do what?

159
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:38,926
<i>President Shears
personal art collection</i>

160
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:40,976
<i>was on display at the Drexler.</i>

161
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,685
<i>It may have been the bomb's target.</i>

162
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,483
<i>New York's counterterrorism units
are taking no chances.</i>

163
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,644
<i>All public transportation
has been suspended.</i>

164
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:53,114
<i>The East wing of New York's
oldest Art Museum is still burning.</i>

165
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:57,291
<i>3 guards have been rushed to Bellevue
Hospital and are in critical condition.</i>

166
00:10:57,432 --> 00:11:00,096
- <i>But no fatalities...</i>
- All of Will's stuff is gone!

167
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:03,067
I mean there's no way
he could have beaten us back here.

168
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,768
<i>... it clearly shows
2 men fleeing the museum.</i>

169
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,889
<i>They appear to be using rollerblades.</i>

170
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:11,834
<i>The suspects are Caucasian,
in their late 20s.</i>

171
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,113
<i>The authorities are asking
anyone with information</i>

172
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:16,528
<i>to call the city's terrorism hot line.</i>

173
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:18,927
They're calling us terrorists, now!

174
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,565
<i>The Drexler is an invaluable part
of this city...</i>

175
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,640
- What are you doing?
- Get changed.

176
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,661
- My dad had a great lawyer downtown.
- We got a lawyer right here.

177
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,206
- A real lawyer!
- I'm a real lawyer!

178
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,707
Stop pretending
this is not happening, Jay!

179
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:36,422
Will apologized right before
the museum exploded.

180
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:37,757
By the time we get back here,

181
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:40,456
all of his stuff is gone
and our faces are on TV?

182
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,199
What are you trying to say?

183
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:43,870
Do you think Will framed us for this?

184
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,582
There's no reason that our best friend,

185
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:47,522
a guy we lived with for 2 years
would do this!

186
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:49,979
Well, I'll be happy to ask him
what he was thinking,

187
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,550
but he's not here, now, is he?

188
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:54,080
Then we call the cops
and let them look for him.

189
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,215
Come on!

190
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,635
This is Will we're talking about!

191
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,938
This is special agent in charge
Fred Chambers.

192
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,241
I understand I'm speaking with one of
the men from the Drexler museum video.

193
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:15,053
<i>Yes. This is Jay Burchell.
I'm sorry, who am I talking to?</i>

194
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:17,016
Start the work up.

195
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,111
Thank you for calling, Mr. Burchell.

196
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,047
You're doing the right thing
by contacting us.

197
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:25,235
This can only help your case.

198
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:28,463
I want to make it clear upfront that we
had nothing to do with the bombing.

199
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:31,580
<i>But we think a friend of ours was
in  the building when the bomb went off.</i>

200
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:33,957
- You think?
- <i>His name is Will Traveler.</i>

201
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,250
<i>We spoke just before the explosion.</i>

202
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:38,991
<i>If he's alive,
he might have seen something useful.</i>

203
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,725
So you're saying
there is a third suspect.

204
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,135
<i>Yes. No!</i>

205
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,509
Listen, I know how this must look,
but we're not involved.

206
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:47,980
All right, it was just a prank.

207
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,844
<i>We were rollerblading
through the museum...</i>

208
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,649
- You needed to get somewhere quickly?
- I told you it was a prank.

209
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,592
You pulled
right before the Drexler exploded.

210
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,785
It was an innocent joke.

211
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,708
And I'm pretty sure that FBI procedure

212
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,542
does not allow you
to put our faces on TV

213
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,997
<i>without reasonable bases for suspicion.</i>

214
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,574
I suggest you calm down, Mr. Burchell.

215
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:08,328
Bingo. Triangulation...

216
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:10,989
Got them at Park Avenue
between 49th and 54th.

217
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:14,559
Mr. Burchell,
this is special agent Jane Marlow.

218
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,513
I was curious if you might be a lawyer?

219
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:18,664
Yes. Well, not technically, but...

220
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:21,195
Then you understand that in cases
of national security,

221
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,182
standard protocol takes a back seat.

222
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,929
Son, what the hell
did I just see on TV?

223
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:28,112
Dad, listen to me, I can explain, OK?

224
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,828
Are you still there, Mr. Burchell?

225
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,886
<i>Look, I called to help, to tell you
our friend was in the building.</i>

226
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:35,656
Just please, check the security footage.

227
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:39,377
He's 5'10'', he's wearing--
a dark blue track jacket.

228
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,721
Swallow it.

229
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,109
Got them. Burchell, Jason.

230
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:50,251
Room 509 Worcester Park Hotel.

231
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:52,412
Ordered 5 pizzas
from room service last night.

232
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:54,218
How far out are our nearest units?

233
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,714
Less than 2 minutes.

234
00:13:57,322 --> 00:14:00,180
We'll check the footage again.
How does that sound ?

235
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:01,314
Good.

236
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:08,212
Yesterday, over ten million shares
of Holloway Insurance

237
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,816
were sold on the stock market.

238
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:11,351
Do you know what they cover ?

239
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:13,181
Yeah, they're specialized in fine Art.

240
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,092
The Drexler foundation to be exact.

241
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,065
That means that somebody, somewhere,
knew this was gonna happen.

242
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:20,557
- It's all we have ?
- The rest was destroyed by the fire.

243
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:21,593
<i>Do you see him now ?</i>

244
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,833
I'm afraid the rest of the footage
was lost, Mr. Burchell.

245
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:26,297
There's no sign of your friend.

246
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,262
Jay wants us to go to the cops.

247
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,496
<i>That is not an option.</i>

248
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,158
If you're on TV, it is not an accident.

249
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,785
But dad, we weren't involved !

250
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:35,599
That hasn't stop the authorities
from screwing this family before.

251
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:37,616
<i>You need to get out of there now.</i>

252
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,098
Son ?

253
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:43,881
Jay...

254
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:50,401
Are those cars for us ?

255
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,811
<i>Burchell, this is Fred Chambers.</i>

256
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,055
You should come in.
We can talk about this in person.

257
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,890
I told you. You got the wrong guys.

258
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:57,688
It's time to go.

259
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,977
My dad just called, OK ?

260
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:02,220
This is bigger than Will.

261
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:05,943
People, in very high places, knew
that something was gonna happen today.

262
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,238
Now, we have to get out of here,
out of the city.

263
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,287
- If we run, we look guilty.
- It's a little too late for that.

264
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,816
Someone put our faces on that TV.

265
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:20,487
Someone wants us
to take the blame for this.

266
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,073
You of all people know that
this can happen.

267
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,342
We find Will.

268
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:36,373
He's the only one
who can back up our alibi.

269
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,012
Whatever gets you out of this room.

270
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:17,307
Hold it !

271
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:19,476
Come back here !

272
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,120
Where'd they go?

273
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:29,627
<i>Hey, you!</i>

274
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:31,925
Cover that exit!

275
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,446
Suspects on either 3 or 4.

276
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,748
On 3 !

277
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:48,397
Come on!

278
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:03,644
Any more ideas ?

279
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,094
Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.

280
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:09,596
- We're running out of options.
- We call in a bomb threat.

281
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:10,794
You're right, I don't like it.

282
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,463
If they think it's the truth,
they'll clear the hotel.

283
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,630
You two are a long way
from the luxury suite.

284
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,207
We ran out of shampoo.

285
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:34,180
Don't worry.
I ain't no fan of the police.

286
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:37,228
Look, a friend of ours is in trouble
and unless we get out of here

287
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,573
- we're not gonna find him.
- And we can pay.

288
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:40,928
You ain't got enough.

289
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,439
But I do like that watch.

290
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:47,360
It is all yours.

291
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:51,571
- NYPD. Open the door!
- One minute!

292
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:54,286
This leads to the basement.

293
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,240
Take the hall to your right, it leads
to the building next door.

294
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,861
I'm changing. Be right there!

295
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:02,573
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

296
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:04,777
You got three seconds!

297
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:06,999
Come on guys! Gimme a break!

298
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:11,918
Jay Burchell, 26. Graduated Yale Law
last week, top 5 in his class.

299
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,349
UCLA for undergrade,

300
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,770
grew up in Romington California.
Rough neighborhood.

301
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:16,892
What about parents?

302
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:19,643
Mother, Felicia Cruz,
holds multiple jobs in Los Angeles.

303
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,183
- Mainly housework.
- Father?

304
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,043
That's where it gets interesting.

305
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:27,067
Sergeant William Burchell,
served in Iraq, 1992.

306
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,525
He's court-martialed
for a friendly fire incident

307
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:30,838
that killed 5 men.

308
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,898
He took his own life a year later.

309
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:34,049
It's a potential motive.

310
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:35,217
It sounds like payback.

311
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:38,604
So far we haven't found any matches
for the name he gave us, Will Traveler.

312
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:41,092
We checked DMV, NCIC, Credit bureaus.

313
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:42,567
We're looking in the old records.

314
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:44,646
- It sounds like a decoy.
- I don't think so, sir.

315
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,703
He was panicked but his speech pattern
didn't suggest he was lying.

316
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,135
Come on people, talk to me!

317
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:53,657
They got out.

318
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,940
We were on the phone with them
five minutes ago!

319
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:57,821
The room was registered to Tyler Fog.

320
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,212
Calvin Fog's son?

321
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,696
We compared Fog's DMV picture
with the Drexler footage

322
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,018
and got a positive match.

323
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,968
So Tyler Fog's our number two.

324
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,421
OK, I want a profiler running point
in the field.

325
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,052
- That means you, Marlow.
- Me sir?

326
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,740
Richardson's still in DC.
That makes you my senior profiler.

327
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:13,626
So take Boris and check out the Drexler.

328
00:19:13,748 --> 00:19:14,748
No problem, sir.

329
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,649
Cheyenne, I want you
and every available SOG

330
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,661
looking for contacts.

331
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:18,655
Captain Fitz!

332
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,640
I want port authority transit
and MTA to lock up the island.

333
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,431
These guys do not leave Manhattan

334
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,840
unless I personally walk them
across a bridge.

335
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,335
Let's go.

336
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:39,919
- Your car is not here.
- Are you sure?

337
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,847
Look, man, I checked three times.

338
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,179
Now you need to leave.

339
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,193
A lot of people coming here to get cars.

340
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:47,354
Cops are shutting down the subways.

341
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:49,080
Wait, they're what?

342
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:50,391
The subways, man.

343
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,411
Looking for two guys on that bombing.

344
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:54,584
White, not Arabic if you can believe.

345
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:56,725
It's not here Tyler let's go. Thanks.

346
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:58,873
They're shutting down the subways.

347
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,911
Great. Just keep walking.

348
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,483
- Dad.
<i>- Tyler, what's happening?</i>

349
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:07,871
They took the car.

350
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,549
Minor setback.
You need to get to Queensborough bridge.

351
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,232
<i>That's the quickest way for you to get
out of town and get to Elysium.</i>

352
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:15,735
We're heading there now.

353
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:17,503
<i>Good. You still have my black card,</i>

354
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:20,298
- the one I gave you for emergencies?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

355
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,229
Albright, listen. The Pin number

356
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,909
<i>is your birthday.</i>

357
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:26,716
<i>Find an ATM, get out as much cash
as you can.</i>

358
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:29,872
<i>Go to the bridge directly,
and walk across.</i>

359
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:31,440
Call me when you get to Queens.

360
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,358
<i>- And son?</i>
- Yeah?

361
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,558
Good luck.

362
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,167
OK. We're 20 minutes
from getting out of here.

363
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:43,291
Then he states a two hour drive.

364
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:45,987
We'll be safe, there.
That's off the grid.

365
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:47,737
I'm not going.

366
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:49,747
- What?
- I left that room

367
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:51,275
so we can find Will,
not to run.

368
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,633
Will is a part of this, man!

369
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:55,075
He's the one who parked the car
so they could take it.

370
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:57,504
Maybe he was set up too.
Did you ever think about that?

371
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,376
Maybe he had a gun to his head
when we talked to him on the phone.

372
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:02,299
We get his picture, take it to the feds.

373
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:05,355
- Let the system find him.
- But he doesn't want to be found!

374
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:06,703
Tyler!

375
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,507
Look, I know you and Will were closer,
that you knew him better.

376
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,821
But things are different now.

377
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,930
We are the ones out on this sidewalk,
not him.

378
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:19,141
- Then run, Tyler.
- Don't do this, Jay.

379
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:21,719
It'll be easier for you to get out
on your own.

380
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,872
I don't want to go without you.

381
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:43,517
All right, fine.

382
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,478
But I'm gonna wait for you
on the Queensbourough bridge footpath.

383
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:52,666
And if you're not there in an hour,
I'm gonna leave without you.

384
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,073
But Jay...

385
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:57,863
for both of our sakes,

386
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,485
I hope you're there with me when I go.

387
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,344
You're the tenth person who's called me.

388
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,755
I'm just getting home.
I'll call you later.

389
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:39,621
<i>...were able to salvage
some of the artwork inside.</i>

390
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,108
<i>Along with Burchell,
police are looking for this man:</i>

391
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:43,472
<i>Tyler Fog.</i>

392
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:45,586
<i>He's the son of Carlton Fog,</i>

393
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:49,018
<i>one of the richest man in America
and convicted conspirator</i>

394
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,502
<i>for the Iran contract scandal
in the late 80s.</i>

395
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:56,832
- I don't have a lot of time.
- Are you alright?

396
00:22:57,653 --> 00:22:59,335
Are these all the pictures
that you have?

397
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:01,811
Calm down

398
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,075
and tell me what the hell is going on!

399
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,965
I've been calling you all day!

400
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,835
Come on, tell me so I can help.

401
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:13,886
We're not terrorists.

402
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:16,489
You know that, right?

403
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:18,072
Yeah, of course.

404
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:23,340
Why are they saying you're involved?

405
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:27,664
'Cause someone...

406
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:30,053
is trying to make it look like
it's our fault.

407
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,164
Look, Will was in the museum
when the bomb went off,

408
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:36,462
I need pictures,
just something to take to the cops.

409
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,539
Alright then. We'll look together.

410
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,204
Come on, Will!

411
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:46,797
Every photograph...

412
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,595
He never wanted his picture taken.

413
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:51,437
He'd try steeling my camera at parties.

414
00:23:58,106 --> 00:23:59,113
Come on!

415
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:00,767
There's gotta be one!

416
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:03,759
It's okay, we'll keep looking.

417
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:04,929
It's not okay.

418
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,632
How could I live with him for two years,

419
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:07,975
and not have one picture of him?

420
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:13,811
Tyler was right.

421
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:20,207
Will was a part of this.

422
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:24,116
Ground zero.

423
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:28,515
My team found traces of aluminum,
naphtaline and palmitate.

424
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:29,923
Napalm.

425
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,373
Highly compressed
to get this kind of dispersion.

426
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:34,139
You think a law school grad
could do this?

427
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:35,496
Yeah, if he's Ted Kazinsky.

428
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:37,284
This is some pretty complex engineering.

429
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,977
I want a copy
of Burchell's and Fog's transcripts.

430
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:41,099
Sure thing.

431
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:42,523
Lucky that people got out.

432
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:44,748
Such a blast should have caused
more casualties.

433
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:46,408
Not everybody got out.

434
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:01,961
Burchell mentioned a friend
in a blue track jacket.

435
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:08,725
<i>What about the idea
that this might somehow be</i>

436
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:11,394
<i>an act of retribution
for what happened to their fathers?</i>

437
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:13,875
<i>Perhaps, but if Fog and Burchell
have ties</i>

438
00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:15,644
<i>to terrorist groups overseas,</i>

439
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,961
<i>they will be considered
enemy combatants</i>

440
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,477
<i>and remanded
to the military...</i>

441
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:22,688
Alright. Then we get a lawyer!

442
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,911
A whole team of lawyers!

443
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:25,142
- This is not over!
- It is!

444
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:27,402
Tyler's dad said people knew
this was gonna happen.

445
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:29,302
You're gonna believe a man
like Carlton Fog?

446
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:31,354
Listen to what they're saying about us!

447
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,756
Enemy combatants!

448
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:36,063
Alright? If we go in now, they will
ship us out to Guantanamo Bay.

449
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:45,362
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:48,914
Will was my best friend.

451
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,176
I told him things, I trusted him.

452
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:55,706
What if everything he did and said
was a lie?

453
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,091
Then we...

454
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,166
- fight this!
- No, I have to fight this.

455
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:03,747
I don't want you to get involved.

456
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,914
You know,
half the city is on the streets.

457
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:11,336
By now, those people
are trying to get home

458
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,208
They haven't seen the news yet,

459
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,023
They're not focused
on what we look like.

460
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:16,483
But they will be soon.

461
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,695
Wait...

462
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:19,667
Somehow, I'm gonna see you again?

463
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,795
Do you remember
the first time we met?

464
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,557
Will did everything he could
to keep me from calling you.

465
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:28,057
He probably knew
it would complicate his plan.

466
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:29,857
But he didn't keep us apart then,

467
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:32,028
and he won't keep me
from coming back to you now.

468
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:49,916
You can't run from this.

469
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:53,738
My father died because someone
in the government betrayed him.

470
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:57,005
It didn't make me hate my country,
it made me want to fix it

471
00:26:57,752 --> 00:27:00,595
but if I'm gonna fix this,
whatever is really going on,

472
00:27:01,502 --> 00:27:03,833
I need to figure out
who Will Traveler really is.

473
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,565
- We got something here.
- What is it?

474
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,143
I've got Carlton Fog making
six $500 withdrawals

475
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:31,318
near 59 and Lex.

476
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,863
Carlton Fog is not in the city.

477
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,660
I want Burchell and Fog
wrapped up tight

478
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:36,857
before President Cheers
returns from Tokyo.

479
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:38,221
That means today!

480
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:39,667
Sir?

481
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:41,609
We found Tyler Fog.

482
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:48,562
- Can you hurry up, please?
- Have a little patience.

483
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:03,351
<i>All units look for Tyler Fog.</i>

484
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,485
<i>White male...</i>

485
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,212
12-9 to Central,
I've got the Drexler suspect

486
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:19,915
heading East to the tramway path.

487
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:21,708
What's your 20?

488
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:23,714
We're on it.

489
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:07,277
- Cover the block.
- Marlow!

490
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:26,446
FBI! I will fire!

491
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,894
Keep your hands up and turn around.

492
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,184
There's nowhere to run, Fog.

493
00:30:36,063 --> 00:30:37,079
Cover me.

494
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,549
Look...

495
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:50,768
the guy you want left hours ago.

496
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,501
You can tell me all about it
when this is over.

497
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:57,176
<i>Marlow, this is Chambers. Copy?</i>

498
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:58,641
Take him.

499
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:01,268
Go for it, Marlow.

500
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,395
<i>A call coming through
on your cell. Answer it.</i>

501
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:05,100
- Who, sir?
<i>- Jay Burchell.</i>

502
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:09,140
- Okay, you're on, Mr. Burchell.
<i>- Who am I talking to?</i>

503
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,863
Mr. Burchell,
this is special agent Marlow.

504
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,456
- I'm glad you called.
- Stay down.

505
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:17,169
We're taking your friend
into custody.

506
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,550
Any chance you'll come in too?

507
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:20,030
<i>I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

508
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,657
I won't tell you
how the law works.

509
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:24,101
If you don't cooperate now,

510
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:26,799
<i>you'll go away for a long time
when we catch you.</i>

511
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,777
I've got another bomb in the city.

512
00:31:42,395 --> 00:31:44,803
I want you to call of your men
or I will have to detonate.

513
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:47,621
What if I said I think you're bluffing?

514
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,409
We found your friend Traveler
in the museum...

515
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:51,779
dead.

516
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:01,343
I'd say you'd never really know
what someone is capable of.

517
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:04,123
And you still have to take my deal.

518
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:22,307
I've got Burchell on hold.
What do we have ?

519
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:24,271
Cell tower put him
within a 3 block radius.

520
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:25,899
I'm working on video from dock cams.

521
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:27,603
- Marlow, I'm pulling you out.
<i>- What?</i>

522
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,182
- I want you out of there now.
- We can't negotiate!

523
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,304
<i>We're not.</i>

524
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:32,436
Tell him what he wants.

525
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,720
Let him see what he wants.

526
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:35,919
But I am moving undercover agents
in the area.

527
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,491
So give the word for your men
to stand down.

528
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,648
Yes, sir.

529
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,062
Put Burchell back on line.

530
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,489
It's your lucky day,
you can have your friend.

531
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,930
<i>It's gonna take a minute to clear.</i>

532
00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:52,270
All units, pull back.

533
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:54,454
All units, pull back of the area.

534
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:56,093
Pull back!

535
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:01,422
Get him up!

536
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:10,446
- Uncuff him.
- What?

537
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:11,591
Come on, uncuff him!

538
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:23,950
Burchell, we're leaving Fog now.

539
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,363
Pull back !

540
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,613
The bomb. I want the location.

541
00:33:57,388 --> 00:33:58,391
<i>Brooklyn Bridge,</i>

542
00:33:58,543 --> 00:33:59,816
North West abutment.

543
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,131
<i>- Jay, what did you tell them?</i>
- I gave up a 2nd bomb.

544
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,020
<i>- You did what?
- No, it worked.</i>

545
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:19,243
<i>Just like you said
it would, they're clearing out.</i>

546
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:26,656
I didn't think you'd come back for me.

547
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:28,711
You'd do the same for me.

548
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:31,747
They'll still be watching the building.

549
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,213
Be careful getting out.

550
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,123
Okay, you too, pal.

551
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,620
That's enough, Mr. Fog.

552
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,431
It's a hell of a way
to start a road trip.

553
00:35:56,992 --> 00:35:58,801
I should have listened to you
this morning.

554
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:00,831
Not Will.

555
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,429
Will's dead.

556
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,053
I know.

557
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:09,217
You were right about him.

558
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,130
Look, I know we've been at each other...

559
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:21,054
Shut up back there!

560
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,354
Get out!

561
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,554
On your feet!

562
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,261
Come with me.

563
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,302
Now!

564
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:03,154
Who are you?

565
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,630
I'm the only person who believes
your side of the story.

566
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:09,760
Wait a minute!

567
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,980
You just killed two FBI agents.

568
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,108
Get up!

569
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:32,551
What happened to Will?

570
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:34,860
If you know what's going on, tell us.

571
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:41,309
You'll need this more than me.

572
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,345
Once you get over the bridge,

573
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:47,473
the only people you trust
are each other.

574
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,151
Now go.

575
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:50,865
Go!

576
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:25,786
Dad, it's Tyler.

577
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:27,233
We just got out of the city.

578
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,698
If all goes well,
we'll be there by 7, maybe 8.

579
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:49,935
You must be Will.

580
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,546
- Oh, actually I'm Jay.
- I thought I'd take a chance.

581
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:54,212
Tyler Fog.

582
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,996
Wait, you're a Cubs fan?
I thought you were from L.A.?

583
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,535
My dad was from Chicago.

584
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:01,377
I was actually at the game
when Barber went for the foul ball,

585
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,677
- cost him a pennant, total heartbreak.
- Yet again.

586
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:08,588
And the circle is complete.
Hey, you must be Will Traveler?

587
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,396
- Yeah.
- Tyler Fog, school management.

588
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:11,743
- This is...
- Jay.

589
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:13,284
Jay Burchell, law school.

590
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:15,523
I read the housing ticket.

591
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,821
Looks like we've got a nice place.

592
00:40:18,055 --> 00:40:19,857
Yeah, well, wait till you see upstairs.

593
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,784
I'm sorry, guys, I have to take this.

594
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,442
Hey, dad, can I call you back?

595
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:27,424
So that's Tyler Fog?

596
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:30,470
I wonder what he's doing
in grad housing.

597
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:32,469
I'm sure he'll be happy to tell us.

598
00:40:34,963 --> 00:40:37,018
You're kidding me? You're a Cubs fan?

599
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:39,710
Yeah, we just went through this.

600
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,817
Wait. You too?

601
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,576
I am loving this house already.

602
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:49,606
Wait. What are the chances that 3 guys

603
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:52,458
from L.A, Maine and the Hamptons
all like the same team?

604
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,084
Must be fate.

605
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,846
<i>I know a garage in 51st.
It's half the price.</i>

606
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:01,009
<i>I'll meet you in the room.</i>

607
00:41:01,131 --> 00:41:02,508
<i>You take time to step off the path</i>

608
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,809
<i>and really see
what makes this country tick?</i>

609
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:07,034
<i>- It'll change your life.
- If you're out, we are.</i>

610
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,734
<i>Good luck. I'm sorry I had to do this.</i>

611
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,323
My dad knows a used car dealership
2 blocks away

612
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:14,445
and they take cash.

613
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:16,204
Can he help us track down
and phone Will?

614
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,923
- He's the only lead we got.
- He's already looking into it.

615
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:20,753
- Dad?
- Okay, son, listen...

616
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:23,905
Call from the road
if you have any problems.

617
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,155
We'll see you soon.

618
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:42,157
I've done as you asked,

619
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:44,819
they'll be here tonight.
