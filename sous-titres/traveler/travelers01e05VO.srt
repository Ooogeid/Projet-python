1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:01,981
<i>Previously on</i> Traveler...

2
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:03,267
<i>Did you get out?</i>

3
00:00:03,457 --> 00:00:04,848
We're at the corner. Where are you?

4
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,451
<i>I'm sorry, I had to do this.</i>

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,892
You think Will framed us for this?

6
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:13,609
Will apologized right before
the museum exploded,

7
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:15,064
and our faces are on TV?

8
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:18,158
<i>We think a friend of us was
in the building. His name Will Traveler.</i>

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,812
We found Traveler
in the museum... dead.

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,108
This was destroyed
in the Drexler bombing.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,605
I wanna know what I have.

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,478
Will asked me to keep this for him.

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,968
It can help us fight back.

14
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:29,748
You and Will were...

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,820
I don't know about Traveler.

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
You lie.

17
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:38,165
It's Will.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,420
Everything has been taken care of.

19
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,951
Except for Burchell and Fog.

20
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,433
No. We're coming with you.

21
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:14,907
Did you know Will was alive?

22
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:16,450
I didn't think he was dead.

23
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,974
- Wait! The other van's got...
- Not the one we want!

24
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:34,506
Watch out!

25
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:02,653
Tell me you got a lead.

26
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,041
Techs traced a call
to Kim Doherty this morning.

27
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,819
A small town in Maine...
Deer Harbor.

28
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,184
Are we on that?

29
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,810
Chambers gave it
to the Boston field office.

30
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:15,188
That's the only solid lead
we've had since New Haven.

31
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,176
Boston's 3 hours closer,
and hoofing it

32
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,560
all the way up there
just to interview a few witnesses

33
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,090
ain't my idea of a productive day.

34
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:24,506
Besides, we got something else
going on down here.

35
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:40,813
What is that thing?

36
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:42,999
A tracking device.

37
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,587
They cut it out of him.

38
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:47,002
How do you know?

39
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:49,376
Because I shot him with it.

40
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,545
What do you want with Will?

41
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:54,222
The girl in Deer Harbor,

42
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,671
the one at the bookstore,

43
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,448
- did she give you anything?
- Maya?

44
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,453
You've been watching us?

45
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,040
You'll need this more than me.

46
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,697
You put one of those things
in my watch, didn't you?

47
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,960
You know, we've almost died
like eight times out there.

48
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,423
Where the hell have you been?

49
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,214
This was never about us
for you, was it?

50
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,039
You're just using us to find Will?

51
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:25,534
Nothing personal.

52
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,768
Did she give you anything?

53
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,464
She didn't.

54
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,232
We're not done with you!

55
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,030
The morgue called.
Jenny's on her way down...

56
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:56,929
Said she had something interesting
on the dead guy from the Drexler.

57
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,933
Don't worry. I haven't told him yet.

58
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:02,836
Good, because I don't think
he would approve

59
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,805
of this little detour
in the investigation.

60
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:05,927
Why not?

61
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,623
Because right now
he's focused on those two boys,

62
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,138
and this is about Will Traveler.

63
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,366
You think he's in there?

64
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,751
Probably a switch point.

65
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,438
With a 10-minute lead,
they could be anywhere.

66
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:34,769
Yeah, or they're in there
waiting for us.

67
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,231
One way to find out.

68
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,350
John Doe from the Drexler, right?

69
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:44,449
Adult male, Caucasian,
average build, nice dental work?

70
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:45,886
Where are we on D.N.A.?

71
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:47,930
Running it through C.O.D.S. As we speak.

72
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:50,682
So why are you down here? I know
you like my company, but...

73
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:52,744
It seems your victim
was dead before the blast.

74
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,710
- What?
- No smoke in his lungs.

75
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:57,686
Plus he had some minor contusions
and a broken neck.

76
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,852
You see there?

77
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,867
The anterior displacement
between C3 and C4.

78
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,993
Usually what you see
in a quick-kill scenario.

79
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:05,961
So Burchell and Fog
snapped Traveler's neck,

80
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,162
planted the body. It fits
with the initial theory.

81
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,617
Sure, until you see this.

82
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,573
I just finished
the facial reconstruction.

83
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:19,427
That's not our guy.

84
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,319
So whoever Will Traveler is...

85
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,704
He didn't die in the Drexler.

86
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,054
The van's clear.

87
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,915
It's the middle of nowhere.

88
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,807
- It's worth it.
- Alright, Will is alive.

89
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,911
How do you know Will is alive, Jay?

90
00:07:58,088 --> 00:07:59,113
There's blood in that van!

91
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:02,169
If they were gonna kill him, they would
have done it at the station.

92
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,238
That's comforting. Thank you.

93
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,119
So, which way do we go?

94
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:08,699
We don't go anywhere.

95
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,464
You said after the Drexler
you were the only one

96
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,208
who believes our side of the story. Why?

97
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,309
Because I know there were other people
behind the bombing that day.

98
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:18,668
Who?

99
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:21,526
We're not going anywhere
until you tell us.

100
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:23,903
Alright, what about Will?
How do we find him?

101
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,814
You don't. He's not your friend,

102
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,149
and he's not someone you want to find.

103
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,587
Someone's out there.

104
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:38,465
What?

105
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:43,281
Get outta here. This is a trap!

106
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:46,964
Go! Get the hell out of here!

107
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:49,454
We're not going anywhere
until you tell us...

108
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:55,236
I can't protect you if you stay! Now go!

109
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:23,532
Subtitles: swsub.com

110
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:36,993
Hello, Will.

111
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,024
Who are you?

112
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:41,806
My name is Kate.

113
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:46,589
You don't remember me?

114
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,513
We met once at a dinner party.

115
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,560
You were charming, and I was...

116
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:53,343
I was tipsy.

117
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:01,368
Come. Sit.

118
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:21,895
You part of hometown?

119
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:23,665
Yes.

120
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,796
And I am sorry for the way
things went in the van.

121
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,546
Were you on you way to see Maya?

122
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,352
I thought I need the safe house.

123
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,230
Well, we'll save that for later.

124
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,419
But right now I'd like to talk to you

125
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,383
about what happened on the day
of the Drexler bombing.

126
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,601
You think that guy
made it out of there alive?

127
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:55,918
I don't know.

128
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:07,318
You think we'll make it?

129
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,585
Let's just find Will.

130
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,607
You heard the guy.
He said Will is not our friend.

131
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:15,293
Well, Maya said something different.

132
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:16,736
You know, I would love to think

133
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,972
that some part of Will's friendship
was real,

134
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:20,656
that he can help us.

135
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:22,696
But...

136
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:26,500
Going back to Deer Harbor, to Maya...

137
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,297
Whatever it is you're thinking,

138
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,681
finding Will is a bad idea

139
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,014
until we can figure out
who he really is.

140
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,316
Maya said he'd come back for the key.

141
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,480
That's gotta mean something.

142
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:54,796
Then let's find out.

143
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:06,058
Sir, I just got word regarding
our John Doe from the Drexler.

144
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,727
- C.O.D.I.S. matched the D.N.A.
- And?

145
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,600
The name's not Traveler. It's Murden.

146
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:10,853
Could be an alias, no?

147
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:11,975
I don't think so.

148
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,433
So Will Traveler lives?

149
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,159
You get anything else on Murden?

150
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,881
Checking accounts, some old W4's
an address in Harlem.

151
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,073
Good. Check it out.

152
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,747
I want you to see how this guy
connects to Burchell and Fog.

153
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,312
I'll have agent Randall activate
the Will Traveler search.

154
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:39,223
Hopefully, we'll dig something up.

155
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,009
Good work.

156
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:49,384
Come on.

157
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,175
This key's over a hundred years old.

158
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,915
The guy couldn't help us
much beyond that.

159
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,539
He said we might have
more luck with an historian.

160
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,042
Check this out.
I found it under my seat.

161
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,185
Bay Point Marina.

162
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:12,299
Yeah, it's a receipt for a boat slip
in Boston.

163
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:14,491
- It's reserved for the 12th.
- Tomorrow?

164
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:15,828
Will was going to Boston.

165
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:17,866
Maybe, just maybe...

166
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:21,663
he was going there to use this.

167
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:26,099
Yeah, Tyler was...

168
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,175
into the Drexler prank
from the beginning.

169
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:29,716
He liked the idea, but...

170
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:34,114
- Took some convincing?
- Yeah, it was part for the course.

171
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,867
- The guy was a boy scout.
- So you've said.

172
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,890
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

173
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:43,645
So, I let Tyler do most of the talking.

174
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,525
He was usually good
at bringing Jay around.

175
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:48,154
And we headed inside,

176
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,775
and I had them
in the east wing ready to roll

177
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,559
at half-past on the nose,
per my directive.

178
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,249
And then?

179
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:59,775
Then you know what happened.
East wing's gutted.

180
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,671
How did they get out, Will?

181
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:10,938
I don't know.

182
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,675
Did you pull the fire alarm?

183
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:16,114
Of course not.

184
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,566
Then who did?

185
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,005
It could've been anybody.

186
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:24,223
Some people panicked
when they took off down the stairs.

187
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:26,380
They were supposed to die in the blast.

188
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:29,067
Your directive was
to activate the bomb and get out.

189
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:30,467
The bomb was already activated

190
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,430
by the time I got there.
I did as I was told.

191
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:34,827
I didn't change the plan.
Someone else did.

192
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:45,874
Who are you?

193
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,125
Time to go, Will.

194
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:51,926
Job's done.

195
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:54,564
We only need you
to get your friends here.

196
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,410
It's time to go.

197
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,179
<i>We only needed you
to get your friends here.</i>

198
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:21,042
- What was he doing there?
- Making sure the job got done.

199
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,386
It is very important
that I believe what you tell me.

200
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:29,558
Do you understand?

201
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:31,844
Absolutely, and I was gonna do my job.

202
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,091
<I>Did you get out?</I>

203
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:45,766
<I>Yeah, we are at the corner.
Where are you?</I>

204
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,647
<I>I'm sorry. I had to do this.</I>

205
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:55,743
Now I think, clearly,
you changed the plan, Will.

206
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,655
So...

207
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,124
What do we know, Will?

208
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:15,264
We know that you're not
telling me everything.

209
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:18,386
- We know that you pulled
the fire alarm.
- Wait a minute.

210
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,846
We know that when you got
the order to carry out the job

211
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,915
and kill your friends, you hesitated.

212
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,848
Joseph knew you couldn't do it,

213
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,146
and that...

214
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,667
is why the second man was there.

215
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:40,326
I wanted them to get clear.

216
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:43,611
- That's all.
- But that wasn't the plan.

217
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:47,141
Joseph still got what he wanted.
He got his patsies.

218
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,094
That wasn't the plan.

219
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,405
Let's not forget you were the one
who asked

220
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,033
for this assignment two years ago.

221
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,630
I didn't know how it was gonna end.

222
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:10,596
I'm on hold. Anything?

223
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:13,157
No, nothing but a bunch
of out-of-work actors.

224
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,791
Well, keep looking. Yeah. Hi.

225
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:20,824
Excellent. Thank you very much.

226
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,216
All right. Bye-bye.

227
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:24,906
What?

228
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,915
The finest historical tour in Boston.

229
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,229
The guy's name is Benedict,
for god's sake.

230
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:34,098
Do you ever gamble, Will?

231
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
What?

232
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,959
Best assignment I ever had was Vegas...

233
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,249
Tracking high rollers,

234
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:43,401
winning the money back
if it got in the wrong hands

235
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,122
and learning to read the tells

236
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,460
these billionaires
try to hide at the big tables.

237
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,092
Look at me.

238
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,512
I can read you, so no more lies.
Understand?

239
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,063
Do you understand?

240
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:02,396
Yes.

241
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:04,999
Good.

242
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:12,535
So Jay and Tyler
are still unaccounted for.

243
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:17,990
It's important that you help us clarify
just how big a liability they may be.

244
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:27,681
Folks, this ends our time together,
but I'll have you know,

245
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,845
Washington himself considered this

246
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,595
among the finest watering holes
in all of Boston,

247
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,374
so step inside, have a drink,

248
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,687
have a few, and good day.

249
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:53,432
Benedict Carver, right?

250
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,711
Tour's over, kid.
Next one's at 6:00, if I'm awake.

251
00:18:58,518 --> 00:18:59,974
Actually, I don't want a tour.

252
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,530
I was just hoping
I could show you something.

253
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,414
Well, should we go
to the bathroom for this?

254
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,475
What do you want?

255
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:12,098
It's...

256
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:13,974
my grandpa's key.

257
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,528
He just passed
and left it to me in his will.

258
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:20,048
Thing is, I don't know what it opens,

259
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:22,759
and the locksmiths
haven't been much help.

260
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:32,290
You one of these snobby blue bloods
from Harvard, kid?

261
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:33,412
I'm sorry?

262
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,762
Well, you're not from around here.

263
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:40,877
Glorious city. Spend some time!

264
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,716
I've seen these keys a few times.

265
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:46,977
Nothing to get excited about.

266
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,204
The "b" in this case represents
a place called Boston hall.

267
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:55,708
It's a library, kid,
a couple miles from here.

268
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:59,008
This is a key to one
of their research lockers.

269
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:00,412
A research locker.

270
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:10,234
You take one of my tours before, kid?

271
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:11,624
You look familiar.

272
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:14,751
No, sir. Maybe next time, but thanks.

273
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,156
Thanks for your help.

274
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:23,728
They're nobody.
These guys couldn't buy a clue.

275
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,070
And yet they seem strangely
adept at life on the run.

276
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,038
Are they exceptionally lucky,
or is someone helping them?

277
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:33,166
I'm not helping them.

278
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,872
But you are concerned
for their well-being.

279
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:42,838
I've studied you, Will,
and I know when you're lying.

280
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:46,344
It's written all over your face
all those tics and hesitations.

281
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:50,135
You became friends with them,
didn't you?

282
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,714
What did I just say?

283
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:01,771
You lost your objectivity
as it related to this assignment.

284
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,790
Yes.

285
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,426
Have you spoken to them?

286
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:12,700
Not since that morning.

287
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,386
Did they know what was going
to happen at the museum?

288
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:18,291
See? We're getting the hang of this.

289
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:20,792
Did you tell them anything
about the people you work for?

290
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,390
Nothing? No names, no associations?

291
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:25,668
- Not a thing.
- Never once a drunken conversation

292
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,418
about your background
or your training?

293
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,349
Nothing beyond what was aproved.

294
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,151
Interesting.

295
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,584
I'd expected worse.

296
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,725
One last loose end.

297
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:42,596
What'd you do with the painting?

298
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:45,773
What painting?

299
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,241
Wrong answer.

300
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:54,932
"Founded in 1807,

301
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:57,339
"it is one of the oldest
independent libraries

302
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,475
"in the country."

303
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:01,770
I interviewed up here
a few months ago...

304
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:04,050
One of the top law firms.

305
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:07,052
You wouldn't have been happy in Boston.

306
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:08,188
I don't know.

307
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:09,869
Seems nice.

308
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:11,664
Kim wanted New York.

309
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:13,770
Like my dad always said,

310
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:16,125
"there's no success
like New York success."

311
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,161
You said we'd find out
what Will was doing here.

312
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,920
You are not gonna believe
what I just found.

313
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:48,180
Hard to believe he died in that museum.

314
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:50,972
Such a terrible thing...

315
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:53,597
Anyway, this is it...

316
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:55,258
Murden's apartment.

317
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:58,931
There you go.

318
00:25:04,284 --> 00:25:05,599
FBI! Show your hands now!

319
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:08,134
Let's go. In the air. Do it!

320
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:11,226
- You said this guy lived alone.
- He did.

321
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,126
Sir, what are you doing here?

322
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,338
You hearing us?

323
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,272
You got him?

324
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:37,440
What's this?

325
00:25:38,314 --> 00:25:39,957
- You smell that?
- Bleach.

326
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:41,440
Watch him.

327
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:48,746
Clear.

328
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:00,023
Tub's filled with some kind of acid.

329
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:01,989
He's wiping the place clean.

330
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:19,128
Still think this guy
might have been our friend?

331
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:23,465
Which guy...

332
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:26,693
Steven Swift

333
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,817
or Christian Malbec?

334
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:30,946
Check this out.

335
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,796
This is Will's school expenses.

336
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:42,784
Paid for by Three Continents Investing.

337
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:44,086
You ever heard of them?

338
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:46,082
Nope.

339
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,244
It's gotta mean something.
He made copies.

340
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:49,716
We need a computer.

341
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,197
The painting, Will...

342
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:00,762
<i>what did you do with it?</i>

343
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:03,293
<i>Look, I don't know anything.</i>

344
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:06,639
Of the nine canvases
in the east gallery that morning,

345
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:09,652
our source on the cleaning crew
found the remains of only eight.

346
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:10,904
You can trust him?

347
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,018
I don't know what happened
to the painting, but I didn't take it.

348
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,187
Yes?

349
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:27,187
You're looking well after your vacation.

350
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,749
I trust you enjoyed the Seychelles.

351
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:30,691
Very much.
It was just as you described.

352
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:33,111
Good.
What's your assessment there?

353
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,986
It just a matter of time.

354
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,653
<i>It's already taking too long.</i>

355
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,134
I put you there
because of your work in Chicago.

356
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:42,493
I understand
and I believe we're very close.

357
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,523
I'm afraid
he's controlling this interview.

358
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,437
I'm having the call put through.

359
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,521
<i>Get some answers and close his file.</i>

360
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,377
It doesn't have to go like this.

361
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,623
Like what?

362
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:07,782
Say hello.

363
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,452
We already know
about your indiscretions...

364
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,472
you and Maya getting involved.

365
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:33,683
You're only making this
harder on yourself, pal.

366
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:36,821
You're impeding a federal investigation
just by being in that apartment.

367
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:38,917
not to mention
trying to destroy evidence.

368
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:41,170
Tell us what you were
burning in that bathtub.

369
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,657
It might help you avoid
standing trial as a traitor.

370
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,126
We have forensics
going through the mess you left.

371
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,183
They're gonna find out
what it was either way.

372
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:52,603
It's gonna look a lot better for you
if we do it with your help.

373
00:28:58,457 --> 00:28:59,997
This looks bad for you, doesn't it?

374
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:01,479
What did you say?

375
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:03,957
There's nothing
on Three Continents Investing.

376
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:05,886
It's not even registered
with the S.E.C.

377
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,915
What about...

378
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:13,009
What about this guy Derek Sellars,
the one who signed the checks?

379
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:15,662
Let's take a look.

380
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:26,859
His name pops up in some

381
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,163
insider trading thing a few years back,

382
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,362
but other than that, he's a ghost.

383
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:38,071
He's got a New York address.

384
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:44,139
What?

385
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:46,266
No. No way.

386
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:49,178
We gotta find out who Will is,
and this guy backed him.

387
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:50,642
He paid for everything.

388
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:54,464
There's checks here dating back
to the day Will moved in.

389
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:02,706
You got a better idea,
I'm open to hearing it.

390
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:07,956
You know that going
back there is crazy, right?

391
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,980
There's no success
like New York success.

392
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,671
We've seen you with Maya.

393
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:19,247
Listen to me.

394
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:22,671
I want to know what happened
to that painting, okay?

395
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:24,504
I want you to tell me.

396
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:27,083
She is in pain,

397
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:29,109
- and it will get worse.
- Don't.

398
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,195
You have the ability to help her

399
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:32,738
if you tell me the truth.

400
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:46,705
<i>Attention, visitors.
This is a fire alarm.</i>

401
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:50,500
<i>Please follow a docent
or security guard to the nearest exit.</i>

402
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:24,201
<i>Did you get out?</i>

403
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,381
Talk!

404
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:31,001
<i>Will? Please, no more. Please.</i>

405
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,228
So why'd you take it?

406
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:38,210
When I saw the second man,
I knew I was no longer trusted.

407
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:41,526
I knew if I need to disappear,
I could sell it and go underground.

408
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:45,557
See, that's the thing.
You let that painting out in the open,

409
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:47,808
it attracts a lot of unwanted attention,

410
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,914
and as you know,
we can't have that.

411
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:51,747
So where is it?

412
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:56,436
A locker.

413
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:57,621
It's in a locker.

414
00:31:58,172 --> 00:31:59,173
Grand Central station.

415
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,074
Lower concourse, number 893.

416
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:02,617
Your tells are so obvious.

417
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,962
<i>Will, he's got a gun!</i>

418
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,285
Where is it, Will?

419
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:10,403
I'm gonna kill you,
I swear to God.

420
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:13,413
But not before he kills her.
now tell me where it is!

421
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,038
It's at the port authority.

422
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:19,423
Lie! You have one more chance,

423
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:21,984
and then I promise you,
he will kill her.

424
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,423
Tell me where!

425
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:29,894
It's in a car.

426
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:32,365
It's in a car.

427
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:34,547
In the trunk.

428
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:36,672
Go on.

429
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:40,997
It's in LaGuardia. Gold 4-door.

430
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,457
Long-term parking lot three.

431
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:45,424
Plate number.

432
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:50,611
A- N- M...

433
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:53,890
5-6-V-8.

434
00:32:57,796 --> 00:32:58,796
Good.

435
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:00,807
That is good.

436
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,321
- You did the right thing.
- <i>Please...</i>

437
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:08,234
Let her go.

438
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:10,647
<i>Get away. I...</i>

439
00:33:10,814 --> 00:33:11,829
Unfortunately...

440
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:15,736
<i>Please! I talked to him!</i>

441
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:25,297
I told you.

442
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,170
I told you!

443
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,255
It was a recording.

444
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:32,906
I killed her two hours ago.

445
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:39,729
Never let it get personal,

446
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:41,884
not in this business.

447
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:56,508
Who's in the hall?

448
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:58,547
You've got no chance.
the building's covered.

449
00:33:58,783 --> 00:33:59,805
How many guards?

450
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,616
You're dead, no matter what.

451
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,018
You do this right,
I promise you it's over.

452
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,812
Give it to me.

453
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,660
You have tells, too, Kate.

454
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:32,780
Check it out.

455
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:37,356
It's the route we were gonna
take on our road trip.

456
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,326
Gotta hand it to the guy...

457
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,932
being such a cold-blooded
son of a bitch from day one.

458
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,888
Do you think he was really a Cubs fan?

459
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:58,744
- Please, how could he not be?
- Right?

460
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,443
You don't lie about something like that.

461
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:02,708
It's sacrilegious.

462
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:04,782
Speaking of...

463
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,263
they're gonna be looking for Cubs fans.

464
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:30,153
He picked the wrong guys to frame.

465
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:36,843
Yeah, he did.

466
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,041
Latest batch of calls off the hotline.

467
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:57,500
- Thanks.
- Anything new?

468
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:01,147
12 calls about shots fired
in Deer Harbor, Maine.

469
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,247
That's where
the call to Doherty originated.

470
00:38:03,696 --> 00:38:06,111
- Boston field agents find anything?
- So far, nothing.

471
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:08,104
What about the sludge
in Murden's bathtub?

472
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:10,031
Forensics couldn't salvage anything.

473
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,912
The solvents used were so powerful.

474
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:17,983
- <i>Prisoner escaped.</i>
- We have an escape.

475
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,440
How the hell did he escape?

476
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:28,904
What's going on down here?

477
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,504
We've got men down in here!

478
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:32,882
How did he get out?

479
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,934
Who the hell are we dealing with?

480
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,496
You've studied the Drexler plans?

481
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:07,980
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

482
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,330
We've set the date.
We move forward in two weeks.

483
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:18,311
The past two years
have all led up to this point.

484
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:21,340
You should be proud of yourself.

485
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:23,175
Thank you, Joseph.

486
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:28,503
There is one aspect to this
that we haven't discussed yet,

487
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:29,886
and that's your roommates.

488
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:31,414
Good morning.

489
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,723
They will be framed for the bombing,

490
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:41,696
and they are expected
to die in the blast.

491
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,696
Is that gonna be a problem for you?

492
00:39:53,008 --> 00:39:55,040
No. Not at all.

493
00:39:58,197 --> 00:39:59,197
Good.

494
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,030
Your country appreciates it.

495
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:10,630
<i>What happened to that painting?</i>

496
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,513
<i>It's in LaGuardia.  Gold 4-door.</i>

497
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:15,824
<i>A-N-M-5-6-V-8.</i>

498
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:31,349
<i>They will be framed for the bombing.
They are expected to die in the blast.</i>

499
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:34,388
<i>- I didn't know how it was gonna end.
- You became friends, didn't you?</i>

500
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:36,707
<i>Now I promise you, he will kill her!</i>
