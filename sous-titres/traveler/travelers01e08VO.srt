1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,508
<i>Previously on </i>Traveler...

2
00:00:02,817 --> 00:00:04,514
It's time to say good-bye to the castle.

3
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:05,672
Shotgun!

4
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:06,984
<i>Three best friends...</i>

5
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:09,824
Head down first. I'll be right
behind you, taping the whole thing

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,310
<i>And one innocent prank
lead to an unthinkable betrayal.</i>

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,159
- Did you get out? - Yeah.

8
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,794
We're at the corner. Where are you?

9
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,145
I'm sorry, I had to do this.

10
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,813
Do what?

11
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,430
We had nothing to do
with the Drexler bombing.

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,250
We were set up, and I have proof.

13
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:31,617
This is a recording
of some guy named Joseph

14
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,453
telling Will to blow up the Drexler,

15
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,832
saying he should frame
Tyler and me for doing it,

16
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,803
and the Drexler is just
the first step in a much larger plan.

17
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:41,641
Seems Traveler has left us quite a mess.

18
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:42,895
You know what to do.

19
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:45,776
He's an undercover federal agent.
He's one of us.

20
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,149
My father is working with the FBI,

21
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:49,652
trying to have us killed.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Freeze!

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,144
Put your hands where I can see them!

24
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:19,390
You drop the gun!

25
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:22,119
Come on, Tyler. Let this man go.

26
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:23,363
Jay, she's lying.

27
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:25,273
The FBI is involved, I have proof.

28
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:28,548
What I know is that you were telling
the truth about Will Traveler.

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,369
- We've got him on video.
- Drop the gun!

30
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,379
Come on, Tyler!
You're not gonna shoot anyone!

31
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:33,524
No, but I will.

32
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:38,588
- You son of a bitch.
- Shut up, Jay.

33
00:01:38,742 --> 00:01:40,744
- I'm here to help you.
- Then turn yourself in!

34
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:43,025
This is the guy who bombed the Drexler.

35
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,390
Your friends are counting on you
to do the right thing.

36
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:47,969
- He's not our friend.
- Tyler, keep your gun on him!

37
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,280
You, put your gun on the ground.

38
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,029
N.Y.P.D. has this area surrounded.

39
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,512
Put your weapon on the ground
and kick it over to Jay.

40
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:00,971
Do it now!

41
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,565
Grab the gun. Let's go.

42
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,775
We're not coming with you.

43
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,029
She tried to arrest you tonight.

44
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:17,525
Jay, if you all come in together,
it'll be a different story.

45
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,097
The FBI is part of this.

46
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:24,482
He's right. They're involved.

47
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:25,955
You want answers?

48
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,292
You want your life back?
You come with me.

49
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:34,345
You're making a mistake.

50
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,391
Don't move.

51
00:02:42,022 --> 00:02:43,758
Up against the wall. Grab the fence.

52
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,265
Move. Up against the wall.
Grab the fence.

53
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,949
Go. Get out of here!

54
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:13,665
Damn it!

55
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,045
This is agent Marlow.

56
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:27,249
Suspects Burchell, Fog, Traveler...

57
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:30,284
Last seen on east 16th street.
All 3 are armed.

58
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:33,483
- What's their lead?
- Five minutes. Traveler's with them.

59
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:49,635
They think we're headed east.

60
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,535
Well, we gotta get off the island

61
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,857
- before they close the city.
- Just keep moving.

62
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:55,938
Watch your step, please.

63
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:03,301
We got a tip.
Doorman spotted three guys

64
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:06,003
matching our suspects'
description coming out of a building.

65
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,682
Don't even think about it, Marlow.

66
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,909
You continually compromise
this investigation.

67
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:13,292
Tonight was no different.
You're off the case.

68
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:15,225
Burchell had evidence about the Drexler,

69
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,381
- about people that knew that...
- What evidence?

70
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,858
A recording of Will Traveler
getting orders to bomb the museum.

71
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,198
- And where is it... this recording?
- Burchell took it with him.

72
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,522
Get back to the field office.

73
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:28,452
All I wanna see from you today
is a report.

74
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:31,161
- That's bull!
- All right, go ahead, Marlow!

75
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,522
Keep pushing,
and you'll be out of a job!

76
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:36,668
Borjes, you're on point now.

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,423
There's no phone line.
The alarm can't dial out.

78
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,189
Come on.

79
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Who are you?

80
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:18,235
Answer the question! Who are you?

81
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,396
Right now I'm your chance
to make things right.

82
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:21,877
Why?

83
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,906
Why, Will? Why'd you do this to us?

84
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,224
You used us!

85
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,999
I came to help you get your lifes back.

86
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,231
Trust me. Don't trust me.
I really don't care.

87
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:54,714
You put the gun down now. You hear me?

88
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,582
He's not gonna shoot me.

89
00:05:58,194 --> 00:05:59,194
Are you, Will?

90
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,061
Not till you get whatever it is
you came back for.

91
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,336
Pull the trigger if I'm wrong.

92
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,080
Jay, you're bleeding.

93
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,444
It's not my blood.

94
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:35,528
Never seen a gunshot before?

95
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,011
Was anything you told us true, Will?

96
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:44,767
What about your... Your father?
You said he drowned.

97
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:48,109
Dead father was to get Jay
to identify with me.

98
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:56,665
What's your name?

99
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:00,472
Traveler? Taft?
One of these in your five passports?

100
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:04,008
- Just call me Will. I'm used to it.
- So you're some kind of spy?

101
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:07,206
What government do you work for?

102
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
Yours...

103
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:11,336
At least I used to.

104
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,903
I'll explain it to you once
we get moving again.

105
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,987
You think we're gonna follow you?

106
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,460
Well, I don't think
you really have a choice.

107
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:24,312
You're not exactly 100% right now.

108
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:27,984
And even if the FBI is involved,
we can still take you to the cops.

109
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:29,862
- You're not gonna do that.
- Oh, yeah?

110
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,811
Why not?

111
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,079
Because I know him.

112
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,477
You like to fix things.

113
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,786
That's the reason you're here
instead of Canada or Mexico.

114
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,567
You wanna fix this? You come with me.

115
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:16,709
Tyler, you drive. You know the city.

116
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:55,955
There was a fight.

117
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,524
How sure are we our guys were here?

118
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:01,472
Tip puts our suspects within
two blocks when the alarm went off.

119
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:02,989
Looks like Marlow hit one of them.

120
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,126
Should slow 'em down.

121
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,755
And they're still walking away!

122
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:02,575
We didn't have anything
to do with the Drexler bombing.

123
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,753
We were set up, and I have proof.

124
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,398
What's this?

125
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,405
Names of people
who sold Holloway Insurance,

126
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,331
who profited from the Drexler bombing.

127
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,807
This is a recording
of some guy named Joseph

128
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,602
telling Will to blow up the Drexler.

129
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:31,237
We need to get to Tyler's car.

130
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,356
- We have a car. - We need yours.

131
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,978
You want the car, then tell us why.

132
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,614
No more secrets.

133
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:40,566
You ever hear the name Jack Freed?

134
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:42,844
Freed knows my father.
he's on the list of people

135
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:44,503
who benefited from the Drexler boming

136
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:46,690
and he's former
deputy director of the FBI.

137
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:48,743
I'm impressed.

138
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,633
After 9/11, Freed started
a domestic espionage program

139
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,292
called operation Hometow.

140
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,178
Spying on American citizens.

141
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,042
That's right.

142
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:02,912
He recruited me into the program,

143
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:05,681
then he left the FBI
to help run Homeland security.

144
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,844
Wait, what are you saying,
homeland security's behind this?

145
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,142
Freed's behind this.

146
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,368
He picked you two as patsies.
You were perfect...

147
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,277
Two guys who had every reason
to hate the government

148
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,864
- for what happened to your fathers.
- And you set us up.

149
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:22,142
You don't know but I saved
your lives at the Drexler.

150
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,418
<i>Did you get out?</i>

151
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:34,098
The bomb had a fail-safe.
It went off anyway.

152
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:35,761
You framed us, Will.

153
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:38,899
I had orders to kill you.

154
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:41,086
I kept you alive.

155
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,588
We're supposed to buy this?

156
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,610
Look, Freed's the one
who took your lives away.

157
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,145
He's the one who can give them back.

158
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:52,093
I saw Freed yesterday with my father.

159
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,021
In New York?

160
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:56,584
Yeah.

161
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,192
How do we get to him?

162
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:02,069
I left something Freed wants
in Tyler's car.

163
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,003
That's why we need it.

164
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,147
Kim told me the FBI found it.

165
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:11,572
Then that's where we're going.

00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:53,853
It's a go.

177
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,133
I want updates from N.Y.P.D.
and transit police.

178
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:04,785
And from the hospitals.

179
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,011
Already on it.

180
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,955
One chance. You understand?

181
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:19,486
You helped Jay meet with agent Marlow.

182
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,902
I'm guessing you had something to do
with the power outage at the club.

183
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,365
Now Jay and his friends
are on the run again.

184
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,459
Where are they going?

185
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,261
I don't know.

186
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,407
Stand up.

187
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:51,285
Turn around.

188
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:00,018
I tried to help you, Kim.

189
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:03,384
I told you what was best for Jay
and what was best for you.

190
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,575
You have the right to remain silent.

191
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:08,853
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

192
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:09,995
in a court of law.

193
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,056
Looks like they're gonna move it soon.

194
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:29,632
We need to do this.

195
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,502
Where are you going?

196
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:34,994
That thing is on a flatbed.
We can't waste time.

197
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,150
No. I'll do this.

198
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:39,188
No way.

199
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:40,693
Jay's going.

200
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,429
Are you gonna shoot me, Tyler?

201
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,485
After the week we've been through...

202
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:20,995
This looks bad for you, doesn't it?

203
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:22,237
What'd you say?

204
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,261
Hi, Harold? Marlow.

205
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:39,884
I need another favor.

206
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,633
We need one more N.S.A. database search.

207
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,653
I only have a first name... Joseph.

208
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,134
Key words... Drexler museum,

209
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:49,658
Will Traveler,

210
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:52,791
Holloway Insurance,

211
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:55,817
Fallbrook Dunn,

212
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:58,073
John Ellington,

213
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,894
Otis Whaley.

214
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,147
I'll call you back in ten.

215
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:05,541
Bye.

216
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:07,593
What are you doing?

217
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,071
Pushing paper, like I was told.

218
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:17,122
You forced Chambers' hand

219
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,066
when you went out
on your own last night.

220
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:23,487
- You could've at least called me in.
- I made a judgment call.

221
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,302
And it almost got you killed.
We're supposed to be partners.

222
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:28,652
Yeah, we are.

223
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:37,647
We'll have 'em by tonight.

224
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,418
This better be worth it.

225
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,021
Come on. Get up! Come on!

226
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,299
Come on!

227
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,399
I look in my rearview,
and there's this mook

228
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,694
- jumping off my truck.
- you sure it was Burchell?

229
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,328
Absolutely. No doubt in my mind.
And then his friends drove up

230
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,837
- in the green 4-door.
- He had something in his hand?

231
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:58,524
Yeah, yeah, rolled up, about this big.

232
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:01,001
- Any idea what that was?
- I just drive the truck.

233
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,745
Somebody else does inventory, man.

234
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,550
Put up the Carlton Fog
surveillance photos from yesterday.

235
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,191
<i>Suspects came back for their car.</i>

236
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:15,341
<i>Rebroadcast the BOLO.
They are travelling in a green SUV,</i>

237
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:16,785
Jersey plates.

238
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:18,251
Let's get Con Ed down here.

239
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:20,456
<i>I want a sewer check
in case they went underground.</i>

240
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,003
- They're not leaving the city.
- <i>I am worried about that.</i>

241
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,970
<i>You think they're planning
another attack?</i>

242
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,554
Last time these three were together,
we lost the Drexler.

243
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,946
Why is the painting
so important to Freed?

244
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,118
I can't tell you what I don't know.

245
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,772
We risked our asses for this?

246
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:41,006
What I do know is that Freed
wants this, for whatever reason.

247
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:44,162
That gives us a chip.
It gives us a hand we can play.

248
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:46,863
It gives us a way to bring Freed to us.

249
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,202
What's in it for you?

250
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,620
We know what we want from Freed.
What do you get?

251
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:55,360
He took someone from me.

252
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:56,973
Who?

253
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:00,164
Maya?

254
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:03,665
That's it, isn't it?

255
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:05,845
You wanna kill him.

256
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,343
He used me, too.

257
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:09,523
Forget it. He's no use to us dead.

258
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:12,471
This painting wasn't destroyed
in the blast like everyone thought.

259
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,921
If we connect it to Freed,
people start asking questions.

260
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,804
I know you are not that naive.
Freed is never gonna let that happen.

261
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,125
We're not killing the only guy

262
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:20,946
- who can prove our innocence. - Wait.

263
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:23,162
Stop. What if there's another way?

264
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,608
'Cause you kill Freed, and it's over.

265
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,442
But if we can expose him,

266
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:32,237
then we can make him suffer.

267
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:38,275
- So what are you saying? - I'm saying,

268
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:40,757
is that something
you'd be interested in?

269
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,693
Borjes, I've got
those Carlton tapes cued up.

270
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:53,057
That's Jack Freed, right?
Former deputy director?

271
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:54,430
Yeah, you're right.

272
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:57,197
What's he doing with Carlton Fog?

273
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:00,927
Wait. Who's that?

274
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,315
Isolate him.

275
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:05,302
More.

276
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:12,980
No way.

277
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,355
- Yes?
- FBI. Special agent Marlow.

278
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:39,378
- Oh. What can I do to help you?
- Joseph Langdon?

279
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:41,415
- Yes. - May I ask you a few questions?

280
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,929
- About? - The Drexler museum bombing.

281
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,815
Why don't you come inside?

282
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:56,134
Nice house.

283
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:59,511
It's my wife's doing entirely.
I'm told I have no taste.

284
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,989
I'll be quick, sir.

285
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,268
You're employed by the crisis
management firm Fallbrook Dunn?

286
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,522
Well, I'm not on their payroll,
if that's what you mean.

287
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:11,989
- But, yes, they are one of my clients.
- Meaning?

288
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:15,248
I'm a consultant.
I work for a number of firms.

289
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,742
Do you know a man
by the name of Jon Ellington?

290
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,112
Only by name.
I didn't know him personally,

291
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:23,229
but that was a tragedy.

292
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,393
I certainly hope you catch
the men responsible.

293
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,920
When was the last time
you were employed by the firm?

294
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:31,909
Is Fallbrook Dunn under investigation?

295
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,094
Just a background search.
It's part of the job.

296
00:23:35,312 --> 00:23:37,010
Excuse me, I'm gonna have to get that.

297
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,941
Yes, this is Joseph.

298
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,508
That's good to know. Thank you.

299
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,556
Tell me who was on that phone.

300
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:04,289
Give me a name.

301
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:08,235
Give me a name!

302
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:46,692
Bag this.

303
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:50,218
And look for the number
of the last person who called it.

304
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,678
Whoever it was ordered this man
to kill me.

305
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:04,919
Put me through to Chambers.

306
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:07,785
Sir, this is Borjes.

307
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,811
I found evidence detailing contact

308
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:12,715
between Carlton Fog and his son
yesterday in Manhattan.

309
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:14,513
- Where? - Fog's club.

310
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:16,384
<i>We had that place stacked out.</i>

311
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:19,018
Tyler Fog slipped
into his father's limo.

312
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:20,181
What's your action?

313
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:22,417
I'm on my way to arrest
Carlton Fog at his club.

314
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,601
It's our best bet of finding
Tyler's location.

315
00:26:25,812 --> 00:26:26,864
I'll meet you there.

316
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:36,935
Sir.

317
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,194
I have a call for you
on the secure line.

318
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:40,452
Who is it?

319
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:42,204
A representative Trumble.

320
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,450
I'll take it.

321
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,653
And, uh, close the door
on your way out.

322
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:05,135
Good afternoon, representative.

323
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,621
<i>I have the painting. Are you interested?</i>

324
00:27:08,182 --> 00:27:09,919
Well, it's nice
to finally speak with you.

325
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,152
<i>It's been some time.</i>

326
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:12,662
Are you interested?

327
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:14,926
This would have been much easier

328
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,531
<i>if you had just given it to us
the first time we'd asked.</i>

329
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:19,541
I want an exchange.

330
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:23,470
<i>But you know that I want more
than just the painting.</i>

331
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:27,662
Yes.

332
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:30,007
<i>Then you're okay with this arrangement?</i>

333
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:32,681
- Yes.
- <i>Great.</i>

334
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:34,860
Name the time and place.

335
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:37,547
Washington Square Park.
One hour. Come alone.

336
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,490
We're good.

337
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:47,368
Let's go.

338
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:01,118
You get more presumptuous every day.
Who told you you could come in here?

339
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:03,210
You did, sir,
by meeting with your son yesterday

340
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:04,458
and not reporting it.

341
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:06,026
I got it.

342
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:08,685
All right, you listen to me.

343
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:10,100
He is my next of kin.

344
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:13,022
I'm under no obligation whatsoever
to tell you anything.

345
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:15,051
We'll let a judge decide that. Cuff him.

346
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:17,279
- Get your hands off of me.
- You under arrest

347
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:18,533
for harboring fugitive.

348
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:20,517
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

349
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,118
I do. Let's go.

350
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,662
Borjes...

351
00:28:23,957 --> 00:28:26,223
Tell this man
he's making one hell of a mistake.

352
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,684
Not this time.

353
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,050
I told you to tell me
if you had contact with your son.

354
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:37,559
Proceed with the arrest.

355
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:42,618
Let's go.

356
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:56,120
This your first big score, Borjes?

357
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,301
Bet you already notified the press.

358
00:28:58,628 --> 00:28:59,668
Not my style, sir.

359
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:01,859
I worked for your boss.

360
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:03,100
No more talking.

361
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:08,437
Get down!

362
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:11,109
Down! Down! Get down!

363
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:13,262
It's Whaley, sir!

364
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:15,918
I got him! I got the shooter!

365
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:17,882
It's Otis Whaley!

366
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:20,438
Give me your radio!

367
00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:23,025
Stay with him! Call it in!

368
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,041
That way, that way.

369
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,412
Freeze!

370
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,910
Drop the weapon!

371
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:45,536
Put your hands on your head.
Drop it now!

372
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,304
I got him covered.

373
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:51,043
Don't move a muscle.

374
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:55,230
This is Whaley, sir.

375
00:30:56,117 --> 00:30:57,117
I know.

376
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:58,991
Good work.

377
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:28,498
Make sure you dispose of this.

378
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:30,116
Yes, sir.

379
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,907
You did good work, Borjes.

380
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:48,181
Too good.

381
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,530
This is S.A.C. Chambers,

382
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:57,343
S.A.C. Chambers. I got a man down.

383
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,147
Four men, Washington Square Park.

384
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:23,271
Yeah, look out for any activity.

385
00:33:25,592 --> 00:33:27,936
I'm leaving now.
I should be there in about ten minutes.

386
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,558
Hello, Will.

387
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,939
Keep going.

388
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:57,058
Mr. Burchell...

389
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,119
And Mr. Fog.

390
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,853
What a surprise.

391
00:34:04,403 --> 00:34:06,471
You two have caused
quite a few problems this week.

392
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:07,651
Sit down.

393
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:11,260
Is this where we share our feelings?

394
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,057
Tell each other how much
we've suffered, sacrificed?

395
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:16,589
Sit.

396
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,954
Don't forget
who you're talking to, Will.

397
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:38,460
Oh, I get it now. This is about Maya.

398
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:42,151
You think I bear
some responsibility for her death.

399
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,646
You didn't have to kill her.

400
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:46,496
Put it down, Will.
That's not why we're here.

401
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:49,528
Yeah, why are you here, Will?

402
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:52,933
I thought we had an arrangement.

403
00:35:02,122 --> 00:35:03,122
Sorry.

404
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:05,430
What?

405
00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:08,487
You were part of the bargain.

406
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:11,192
No.

407
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:14,430
I'm out, no questions asked.

408
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:17,986
You don't come looking for me.
I don't reveal what I know.

409
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,778
What about the rest of our bargain?

410
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,600
Give him the painting, Tyler.

411
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,351
We trusted you.

412
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:30,847
Give it to him.

413
00:35:37,124 --> 00:35:39,597
I Will shoot him, Tyler.
Give him the painting.

414
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:43,532
Give him the painting!

415
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:08,821
What's the fourth branch?

416
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,556
I know the history of the painting.

417
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,941
Then you should know the evidence

418
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,056
was to have been destroyed
in the bombing.

419
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:22,767
All this was about
getting rid of a painting?

420
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,128
No

421
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,032
The Drexler bombing
was about fear and control.

422
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:30,161
This was just the beginning.

423
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,380
Oh, Will.

424
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,361
<i>Then you should know the evidence</i>

425
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:52,542
<i>was to have been destroyed
in the bombing.</i>

426
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,013
<i>All this was about
getting rid of a painting?</i>

427
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:56,344
<i>No.</i>

428
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:57,715
Clever.

429
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,311
<i>The Drexler bombing was about
fear and control,</i>

430
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:02,005
<i>and this is just the beginning.</i>

431
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:05,426
So this is it, Will?
You're gonna choose...

432
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:09,149
two dead men
over an oath you took for your country?

433
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,727
Who do you think
they're gonna listen to?

434
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:31,061
Three known terrorists

435
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:33,556
or a director of Homeland security?

436
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,251
I'll say the tape was doctored.

437
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,462
We've got enough evidence
to get people's attention,

438
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:45,510
to make them
question the story they've been told.

439
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,537
The police aren't gonna charge me.

440
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:52,957
Yeah,
but we're not taking you to the police.

441
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:56,390
There are other ways
of holding you accountable.

442
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,512
The evidence and your confession.

443
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:03,462
The truth about the Drexler
will come out in the press.

444
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,312
Let's go.

445
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:08,280
You wanna know about the fourth branch?

446
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:19,039
It's the reason
your father served his country, Jay.

447
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:20,869
What?

448
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,733
It's the reason Carlton Fog
offered up his eldest son.

449
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:26,589
Don't listen to him. He's desperate.

450
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,156
Will, you've been working
for the fourth branch this whole time.

451
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:35,377
- He's reaching.
- I'm not reaching.

452
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:39,225
Let me go.

453
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:41,998
I'll tell you the truth
about everything.

454
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:46,162
Leave me here, the truth stays with me.

455
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,822
Tell it to them.

456
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:22,905
Agent Marlow?

457
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:27,616
You wanted the last incoming number
off the dead suspect's cell phone?

458
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:30,591
Yeah, thanks.

459
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:47,791
<i>Who is this?</i>

460
00:40:15,184 --> 00:40:16,284
Where are we?

461
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,334
Where's agent Chambers?
Where are you taking me?

462
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,236
<i>News desk. What do you got?</i>

463
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:25,724
The truth about
what happened at the Drexler

464
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:28,030
is in the black limo
parked outside your front lobby.

465
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:29,921
The man responsible is in the backseat.

466
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:32,650
When you get to the car,
call back at this number.

467
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:34,218
<i>Interesting. Be right down.</i>

468
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,416
They're on their way down.

469
00:40:43,823 --> 00:40:46,659
Okay, so if this works
and the story gets out,

470
00:40:48,352 --> 00:40:49,352
then what?

471
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:51,398
Then we keep telling people.

472
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:53,495
It's gonna take a lot of convincing.

473
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,257
It doesn't work like that for me,
I was part of this.

474
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:01,884
When the truth comes out,

475
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:05,081
we'll tell people
you tried to stop Freed.

476
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:24,797
Let's go.

477
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:26,383
Come on. Come on. Go!
