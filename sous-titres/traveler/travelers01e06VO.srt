1
00:00:00,908 --> 00:00:02,038
<i>Previously on</i> Traveler...

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,785
<i>- Did you get out?</i>
- We are at the corner. Where are you?

3
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,257
<i>I'm sorry, I had to to this.</i>

4
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:12,195
<i>We think a friend of us was
in the building when the bomb went off.</i>

5
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:13,399
<i>His name's Will Traveler.</i>

6
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:15,267
So, you're saying
there's a third suspect?

7
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:16,544
You've got the wrong guys.

8
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:18,545
Son, what the hell did I just see on TV?

9
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,132
But, dad, we weren't involved!

10
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:21,929
If you're on TV, it isn't an accident.

11
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:23,615
<i>You need to get out of there now.</i>

12
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:25,475
FBI. Show your hands now!

13
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,282
Tub's filled with some kind of acid.

14
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,714
He's wiping the place clean.

15
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,604
You're impeding a federal investigation.

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,530
Will asked me to keep this for him.

17
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:34,120
Will said that if we ever had to,

18
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:35,733
<i>it could help us fight back.</i>

19
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,555
It's Will's school expenses.

20
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,886
<i>We gotta find out who Will is,</i>

21
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,160
<i>and this guy backed him.
He paid for everything.</i>

22
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:43,843
We already know about you
and Maya getting involved.

23
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:45,317
<i>Will, he's got a gun!</i>

24
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,406
I promise you he will kill her.

25
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,540
<i>- Prisoner escaped.</i>
- Man down in here!

26
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,021
Get the hell out of here!

27
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,344
I'm gonna kill you, I swear to God.

28
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:57,338
Run!

29
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,893
<i>It's time for blood in the streets.</i>

30
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:07,172
<i>Drop your weapon, Fog!</i>

31
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,700
<i>You're safe now, son. You're safe.</i>

32
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,739
<i>As long as we're sticking together,
your father is not an option.</i>

33
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:17,331
<i>Get the hell out of here!</i>

34
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,288
<i>Are you Daniel Taft?</i>

35
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:26,641
Hey! Wake up!

36
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:31,143
You want your car washed?

37
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:33,515
How about some money then?

38
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,750
Please just leave!

39
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:37,444
- What the hell's your problem?
- Get the hell out of here!

40
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,374
- Easy!
- Forget it, man.

41
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,535
Where the hell were you?

42
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:23,475
Whose watch was it last night?

43
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,544
Come on.

44
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:28,544
- I closed my eyes for 2 mins.
- You're not supposed to sleep at all.

45
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,927
- I got tired. Cut me some slack...
- This is New York.

46
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:33,423
These people have not forgotten
about the Drexler bombing.

47
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:34,606
Okay, Jay.

48
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:45,419
You thinking about calling Kim?

49
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:50,128
We're taking a big enough risk
coming back here.

50
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:52,672
We can't contact anyone
the FBI is watching.

51
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:54,941
Kim, your father...

52
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:57,211
- They're not options.
- I know.

53
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,961
We're here to find Derek Sellars,

54
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:02,791
figure out why Three Continents
Investing was bankrolling Will,

55
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,083
and then we either go to the feds,
or we leave.

56
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,255
Wait. Wait, what?

57
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:10,177
Three Continents Investing's
in midtown. We're in Queens.

58
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:11,324
We can't take your car.

59
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,854
We were lucky to drive it
24 hours without getting busted.

60
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,281
So, what, we walk?

61
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:17,483
This is New York.

62
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,686
Got a tip... hard location on our boys.

63
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,872
Let's go.

64
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,215
You got something?

65
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:03,768
Eyewitness places
Burchell and Fog in Boston

66
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:05,990
in the last 12 hours...
a library... Boston hall.

67
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,829
What is it with these guys
and libraries?

68
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,732
- Any idea what they were doing?
- No idea,

69
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:11,763
but we can be in Boston
in the next two hours.

70
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,027
Good. Go.

71
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:15,936
Borjes...

72
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,309
You stay.

73
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,810
My office.

74
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,114
Last night's escapee... where are we?

75
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,265
Situation's gotten more complicated.

76
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:40,692
Man killed one of ours,
then walked out the front door.

77
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:41,819
How does it get worse?

78
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,297
Suspect's still in the wind,
no leads on his whereabouts.

79
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,572
We don't even know who he is.

80
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:47,402
- He was booked, wasn't he?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:49,597
He wouldn't give a name,
so it's a John Doe.

82
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:50,778
Then run his prints.

83
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:52,636
Prints and booking sheets are gone.

84
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:53,804
What about the backups?

85
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,224
- All missing.
- Impossible!

86
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,148
The processing agent
swears he followed...

87
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,793
Then how do four sets
of fingerprints disappear?

88
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:07,256
This guy's a co-conspirator
in the bombing.

89
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:12,704
Find him.

90
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,201
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,625
<i>Maya, we're ready for this.</i>

92
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,333
<i>And what if you don't come back?</i>

93
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,329
<i>Then you take the boat,
and you go on your own.</i>

94
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:35,558
<i>Keep this for me.</i>

95
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:50,347
Everything's gonna work out.

96
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:51,889
If you say so.

97
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:53,407
You're the one I love.

98
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,844
I'm gonna be back. I promise.

99
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,337
<i>I'm gonna be back. I promise.</i>

100
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,465
You tell him I'm coming.

101
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:13,340
Subtitles: swsub.com

102
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,405
I'm agent Walkins.

103
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,083
- Welcome to Boston.
- Catch me up.

104
00:08:22,223 --> 00:08:24,409
Security guard saw
suspects leave Boston hall

105
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:26,782
- and drive off in an S.U.V.
- Surveillance?

106
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:29,727
A.T.M. across the street.

107
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,657
Angle's no good
for the car's plates but...

108
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:33,272
That's definitely Burchell and Fog.

109
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:35,924
- You find the car?
- A.P.B. has no matching S.U.Vs.

110
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:38,267
Also have agents sifting
through traffic cam photos

111
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,618
within the Boston metro area
and tollbooth images

112
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,528
for highways leading into Massachusetts.

113
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:44,055
Ball is rolling.

114
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:46,023
Next move's your call. Where to?

115
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:48,865
Boston hall.
If we understand where they've been,

116
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:50,840
we figure out where they're going.

117
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,770
"Derek Sellars, suite 1024."

118
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,996
Got it.

119
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,327
Looks like a high-class operation.

120
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,339
Agent James Fowler.

121
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:23,996
Two kids.

122
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,351
Six years on the job.

123
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,492
Your idea to superglue
and fume the body?

124
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:34,036
Yes, sir.
Hoping to lift the escapee's prints.

125
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:39,308
The killer's print.

126
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,244
Good call, Borjes.

127
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:36,512
Sorry.

128
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:44,070
- They ready for us?
- Full access.

129
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:45,230
What are we working with?

130
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,481
A dozen surveillance cameras.
We've got them on tape.

131
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:48,982
Excuse me.

132
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,458
The only thing active
is the operating system.

133
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:14,134
Hard drive's been wiped clean.

134
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:16,706
Yeah, the phone lines are dead.

135
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,780
No files, no paperwork.

136
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,699
Derek Sellars and Three Continents
have closed up shop.

137
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:32,189
Yeah, well,
I guess we found the paperwork.

138
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,592
These are all buy and sell orders...

139
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Stock transactions.

140
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:47,885
Wait a minute.

141
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,731
- Wait, here we go.
- What?

142
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,570
See that? That's a ticker symbol.

143
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:55,763
Okay? Here it is...

144
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:57,888
and here it is...

145
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:01,575
and here it is.

146
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,524
You wanna bet these guys
are inside trading?

147
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,746
What's the company?

148
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:06,472
H-O-L.

149
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,345
Holloway Insurance.

150
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,609
Yesterday, over 10 million shares
of Holloway Insurance

151
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:17,484
was sold on the stock market.
Do you know what they cover?

152
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:19,457
Yeah, they specialize in fine art.

153
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,423
The Drexler foundation, to be exact.

154
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24,128
That means that somebody somewhere
knew this was gonna happen.

155
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:26,038
<i>...somewhere knew this was gonna happen.</i>

156
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:29,576
This is proof.
I mean, it might be shredded,

157
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:32,812
but this proves that somebody else
knew about the Drexler bombing.

158
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:38,471
We got company.

159
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,910
<i>Everything has to go.<i/>

160
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:51,511
<i>It's all gotta be destroyed.<i/>

161
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,299
<i>Check the closet.<i/>

162
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:20,539
Who were those guys?

163
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,695
More friends of Will's.

164
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:26,448
That was our last lead.

165
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,184
Well, maybe not.

166
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,748
Look, records of Holloway's stock sales
have to exist somewhere.

167
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,705
- We need to find the names.
- We're not going to your dad.

168
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:39,975
Fine. Fine, Jay,
but this is my world, okay?

169
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:42,176
- We can still talk to people.
- Like who?

170
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,169
- Eddie Hahn?
- Eddie Hahn.

171
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:51,764
That guy lied and cheated
his way through grad school.

172
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,569
We can't exactly be picky now, can we?

173
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,966
He works for Fog financial,
for my dad.

174
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,246
It's a job he only has
because I put in the good word for him.

175
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:05,001
I can make him help us.

176
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,330
What are you taking?

177
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:14,184
The lockbox in question
doesn't belong to Fog.

178
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:16,818
Past two years,
it's been the property of a D. Taft.

179
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:19,442
- We know who that is?
- Not yet. We will.

180
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:21,417
Go to the next one.

181
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,738
Guy goes straight for the lockbox.

182
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:34,575
Keeps his head down, face shielded.

183
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:38,202
He knows where the cameras are.

184
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,683
Uses a bump-and-swipe to pick pockets.

185
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:50,137
Son of a bitch!

186
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:53,988
Freeze it.

187
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:56,770
Closer.

188
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,352
Hold on.

189
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,988
That guy lifted my shield.
Please tell me you recognize him.

190
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:07,359
I do.

191
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:10,789
Hello, Will Traveler.

192
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:21,418
Still in business?

193
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,231
Good.

194
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:29,074
I got a hit.

195
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,612
Access denied.

196
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:38,512
You want this guy's name,
you have to reach out counterterrorism.

197
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:40,948
- You know anyone in that division?
- Yeah. Me.

198
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,118
No go. Who is this guy?

199
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:51,754
I don't know, but he's protected.

200
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,941
The market closed hours ago.
Are you sure he's still in there?

201
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:08,561
This guy is an ass-kisser.

202
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:11,913
He won't leave until
after his boss does. Trust me.

203
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:13,109
I trust you...

204
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,421
It's Eddie I'm worried about.

205
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,267
Eddie is just a means to an end.

206
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:21,483
Look, this is gonna work out. Okay, Jay?

207
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:22,926
I got a good feeling.

208
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:28,838
Here we go. Here we go.

209
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:33,584
Right. that's Leland Mathis.

210
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,846
He runs the private wealth
management department.

211
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,071
That's Eddie's boss?

212
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:40,878
Okay. It won't be long now.

213
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:47,911
Yes, I will call you
in the morning, all right?

214
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:56,013
What are you doing here, man?

215
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:57,145
Just keep walking.

216
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:01,198
I came to collect that favor you owe me.

217
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,510
I don't owe u any favor.

218
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,603
Come on. Your job?

219
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:07,794
Don't tell me you forget that easily.

220
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,762
Look, Tyler, I don't want any trouble.

221
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:10,967
Neither do we.

222
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,707
All we need is a few minutes.

223
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,546
No. No way.

224
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,864
- Absolutely not.
- We just need names,

225
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:22,631
That's all. Okay? A list of equity sales

226
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,845
posted for Holloway Insurance
last monday.

227
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,833
Right.

228
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:31,457
You're serious?

229
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:33,658
We just need your computer
for ten minutes.

230
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,709
Let me see... commit treason?

231
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,987
You know us, Eddie.
we're not terrorists.

232
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,630
Then tell that to the 11:00 news.

233
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,433
We are this close
to clearing our names.

234
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:48,268
And if anyone else...
anyone...

235
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,772
could get us the information we need,
we'd go to them.

236
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:53,344
But we can't, so you're gonna help us.

237
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:03,880
Where's your office?

238
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:07,737
Down here... right next to the one
that was supposed to be Tyler's.

239
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,633
Last monday's
Holloway insurance action.

240
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,890
Am I done now?

241
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:15,265
Almost.

242
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,696
There's a spike in volume,

243
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,886
but there's no block trades.
What's that mean?

244
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,421
That means
that nobody did anything illegal,

245
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,323
- except for you two, so...
- Pull up a list of transactions...

246
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:28,039
Names, uh, affiliations,

247
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,503
anyone who might've profited
from Holloway Insurance.

248
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:32,917
Do it! Come on.

249
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,389
Wait, wait.
Here, here.

250
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:45,679
Yeah, a list of private investors.

251
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:47,802
"Maxwell Abrams"?

252
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:54,534
I've never heard of any of these guys.
- Anything else stand out?

253
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:56,359
No. There's no alarms that are raised.

254
00:19:56,514 --> 00:19:57,534
So we got nothing.

255
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:59,882
There's no way to tell
who was selling based on a tip.

256
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,015
Uh, question...

257
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,121
How do you know
you're looking for a person?

258
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:05,784
See, smart people remove
themselves by a few degrees

259
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,059
from inside trades...

260
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,810
Sell through a company
or a foundation, maybe.

261
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:18,086
The Hadley foundation
sold shares that day, Tyler.

262
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:20,915
What's the Hadley foundation?

263
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,292
It's a nonprofit.

264
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:25,774
Funds after-school programs for kids.

265
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,763
My dad's on the board directors.

266
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:31,850
Your father sold stock.

267
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,529
A foundation he started sold stock...

268
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:36,313
legally.

269
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:40,959
It could just be a coincidence.

270
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,704
This is proof,
something to take to the FBI.

271
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,824
Your father knew about the Drexler.
Why else dump the stock?

272
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:52,047
It's not proof, Jay.

273
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:55,363
My father is a businessman,
he moves billions a day.

274
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,731
One foundation selling
a few thousand shares

275
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,271
does not mean that he set us up.

276
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,745
Why do you always cover for him?

277
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:02,408
Because he's my father!

278
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,232
He wouldn't do that!

279
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:09,681
He's the one who told us about the
Holloway sell-off in the first place.

280
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:12,044
If he's in on it, why would he do that?

281
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:13,616
Think about it.

282
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,935
Maybe we were supposed
to die in the Drexler.

283
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,681
We didn't. That created a problem.

284
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:20,894
And your father provided the solution
by setting a trap at the retreat.

285
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:22,153
We walked right into it.

286
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:23,491
What are you saying?

287
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,535
That my father wanted to kill us,

288
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:27,558
that he wanted his own son dead?

289
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,651
Not until I hear him tell me.

290
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,938
We have been waiting for a solid lead.

291
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:41,944
Now we have to take this information in.

292
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:43,975
Confronting your father
is not gonna help.

293
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:46,156
- Nobody asked you to come.
- I won't let you go.

294
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:49,184
This morning I could've gone to Kim,
but I didn't,

295
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:50,924
because we cannot afford...

296
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,183
Give me the phone!

297
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,951
You're pissed. Man.
I get it. I'd be, too.

298
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,538
Don't patronize me, Jay.

299
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,185
Come on. Let's think this through.

300
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:10,453
Stop making my decisions.

301
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:13,208
You take off now, I won't be
here when you get back...

302
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,315
Don't do this.

303
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:25,751
I have to.

304
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:06,700
If you scream,
the gag goes right back in. You got it?

305
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:07,827
Got it.

306
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,075
The phone works.

307
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:16,108
Tyler's not gonna call.

308
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,300
It's not what guys like him do.

309
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:21,089
Maybe you don't know him
like you think you do.

310
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,270
Yeah, right.

311
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:25,872
I only spend 12 hours a day
with guys like him.

312
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,123
He's not coming back.

313
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,048
- You are on your own now.
- Shut up.

314
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,300
You better have a plan,

315
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,958
'cause in 20 minutes,
when I don't show up for work,

316
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,025
all hell is gonna break loose.

317
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:42,941
I got a deal that closes today.

318
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:45,199
People actually care
about what happens to me.

319
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:47,659
I'm not gonna tell you again
to shut the hell up.

320
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:50,397
Or what? What are you gonna do?

321
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:52,062
You gonna wave your gun in my face?

322
00:23:52,187 --> 00:23:54,483
Go ahead. Do it. I'm tied to a chair.

323
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,476
I'm a hostage in my own apartment.
Do it!

324
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,611
Yeah, that's what I thought.

325
00:24:05,717 --> 00:24:07,665
Give it up, Jay. Come on.

326
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:09,812
It's over.

327
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,304
- I'm innocent.
- Not from where I sit.

328
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:13,933
Tyler's gone.

329
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:16,940
You are all alone.
There's no one left to help you.

330
00:24:19,495 --> 00:24:20,574
You're right.

331
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:22,864
Tyler is gone.

332
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:27,414
But I'm not alone.

333
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:36,219
<i>- Lloyd Rogier Gallery.</i>
- Yeah, Kim Doherty, please.

334
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,310
<i>Sorry, she no longer works here.</i>

335
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,091
<i>Something I can help you with?</i>

336
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:43,103
Bad news?

337
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:48,872
Untie me.

338
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,937
Jay, I'm not gonna call the cops.

339
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:53,313
Yes, you will.

340
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,898
And when they do get here...

341
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:01,127
tell them what we found out
about Carlton Fog.

342
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:48,302
Hey, Charlie. It's me.

343
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:51,962
Long time, man. How you doing?

344
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,345
Right now not so good.

345
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:56,697
Everything that's going on...
it's not true, okay?

346
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,107
You know me. I am no criminal.

347
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:01,635
I believe you. Papers on the other hand,
you're already tried and convicted.

348
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,584
Yeah, I know, and that's why I'm here.

349
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:06,026
I need to speak with my dad.

350
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,284
Is he expecting you?

351
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:09,931
It's kind of a surprise.

352
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:12,920
How's your mother doing the days?

353
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,180
She's out of the hospital.
Thank you for asking.

354
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,348
Yes, of course.

355
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,874
Give her my regards, will you?

356
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:20,540
She'll be upset
you couldn't make it for lunch.

357
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:22,082
Maybe when you're in D.C.

358
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:24,492
In D.C.?

359
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,025
Next time you're down.

360
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:27,952
You'll come by my club.

361
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,382
Hey, Charlie,
who's that man with my father?

362
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:33,173
Don't know. I think he's up from D.C.

363
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:38,441
Thank you.

364
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:43,494
No one questions your level
of commitment, Carlton.

365
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:45,941
You held up your end of the agreement.

366
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,030
Right?

367
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:51,326
I'll see you in Washington.

368
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,530
Drive, Charlie.

369
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:32,513
You knew, didn't you?

370
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:35,093
I knew what?

371
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:36,468
All of it...

372
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,434
Me and Jay, the Drexler,

373
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:41,343
the whole setup.

374
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:50,092
What setup?

375
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:52,158
- Don't do that.
- You need to tell me, son.

376
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:53,907
If you don't tell me, I can't help you.

377
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,335
No more lies. Okay, dad?

378
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:57,174
All I've ever done is try to help you.

379
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,964
That's what I've spent most
of my life doing, actually,

380
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,266
- one way or another.
- I don't need any help.

381
00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:04,096
Not from you.

382
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:06,548
I just want to know why.

383
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,427
Son, you're not making any sense.

384
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:11,175
Two years ago, you cut me off.

385
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:14,811
You forced me into university housing.
Now that was the plan, wasn't it?

386
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,162
Right?

387
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:18,761
To get me and Jay
in that house together with Will?

388
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,593
Tyler, I felt that you needed
to find your own way.

389
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,324
I know about Holloway Insurance...

390
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,530
The sale you made
for Hadley foundation.

391
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:30,846
I know.

392
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:32,082
What is that?

393
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,513
You cashed out before the bombing.

394
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:38,930
You knew it was gonna happen.

395
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:43,595
You offered me up,
and then... you profited from it.

396
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,387
Just tell me, dad,
that you didn't try to have us killed.

397
00:28:57,158 --> 00:28:58,738
This is the real world, Tyler,

398
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,258
and there are choices
that have to be made.

399
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:04,111
Some of those choices
are bigger than you.

400
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:06,379
Choices about what, money?

401
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:09,813
Isn't my life worth more
than some stock portfolio?

402
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,225
- I'm your son
- This has nothing to do with money.

403
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,363
This is about making it right.

404
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:17,013
This is about securing
the future of this family.

405
00:29:17,684 --> 00:29:18,782
Without me.

406
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:20,524
You're not strong enough.

407
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,677
Your philandering, your weakness...

408
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,560
You forced me to shelter you.

409
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:29,208
I've known since you were a child

410
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,592
that you couldn't
lead this family forward.

411
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:39,847
Pull over, Charlie.

412
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:44,650
Just like that, dad?

413
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,541
Just like that,
you can wash your hands of me?

414
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:57,547
The feds didn't make that last light.

415
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,194
It's gonna take 'em a couple of blocks
before the second car picks us up.

416
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:04,169
I would use those few seconds
if I were you.

417
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:06,723
Dad...

418
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,970
Drive.

419
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,728
Every cop in this city has got a photo.

420
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:40,332
What about the name on the lockbox?

421
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:42,833
Daniel Taft address
and phone number, both phony.

422
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:44,717
I'm guessing he paid in cash.

423
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:46,899
By mail...
Still had the latest envelope,

424
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,925
but the lab can't get a print or D.N.A.

425
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:51,083
Do you have any good news?

426
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:53,677
Actually, two days ago,

427
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:56,196
mass pike, B.U. tollbooth.

428
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,050
20 minutes later,
they're spotted at the route 128 toll.

429
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:03,684
These are the only two photos we have.

430
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:08,030
Because if they got off the pike
on any exit after route 128,

431
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:10,199
they'd have to go
through another tollbooth.

432
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,871
No more photos means
they never got off the highway.

433
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
But why go west?

434
00:31:18,014 --> 00:31:19,750
No way would they go
back to Fog's house,

435
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:22,262
- upstate New York... it doesn't fit.
- There's 495.

436
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,764
- What?
- Pike hits it in Waltham.

437
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:26,905
State's working on the road right now,

438
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,547
including the 495 connector,
which means the toll is dug up...

439
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:30,927
No pictures.

440
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,384
Say they took the mass pike to 495...

441
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:37,277
north, south.
They go north, it's Canada,

442
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:39,412
unlikely, but contact border patrol.

443
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:42,287
They go south, they hit I-95

444
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:47,996
New York?

445
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,679
Sir, I believe
they're headed to New York city.

446
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,247
In fact, they may already
be there.

447
00:31:55,404 --> 00:31:57,763
Big city. You got anything
to narrow down a search area?

448
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,920
Not yet,
but they'll seek out a friendly face.

449
00:32:00,074 --> 00:32:02,929
All right, we'll get extra eyes
on Kim Doherty and Carlton Fog.

450
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,622
Start working up a list
of known contacts in the city.

451
00:32:05,815 --> 00:32:06,934
You get back here.

452
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:08,331
Understood.

453
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,069
I don't think this is
a brain's kind of operation.

454
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,080
If you feel that way, then go with God.

455
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:15,617
Why do you keep calling me
if you don't wanna listen?

456
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:16,894
I gotta go.

457
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:21,836
Nice. It's been a long time.
When did you get back?

458
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:24,325
Didn't come here for a reunion, Jimmy.

459
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:26,086
- It's business.
- Yeah, of course.

460
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,455
Gotta make a living, right?

461
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,697
This cover it?

462
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:31,082
Come on. Do I look like
an honest businessman?

463
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:33,078
It's cash only, same as always.
you know that.

464
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,332
It's not about the cards,
it's about the identities.

465
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:37,211
You can pull everything
you need off these.

466
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:41,166
Come on. I got ten different identities,
four different states, a gold card...

467
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:42,628
Yeah, all right, all right.

468
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,139
Just because it's you.
Step into my office.

469
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,004
All right, just do your thing.

470
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:18,046
There's one more thing
I need from you.

471
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,218
Yeah? What's that?

472
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:20,789
You seen Alex around?

473
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:24,655
Yeah, yeah,
I can help you with that.

474
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:26,729
Good.

475
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:30,203
Keep the A.P.B.
on Burchell and Fog updated.

476
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,245
They've doubled back
on their trail before.

477
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:34,314
Any new information
that comes in on Taft,

478
00:33:34,465 --> 00:33:37,024
- the first call you make is to me.
- Got it. And Will Traveler?

479
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:38,904
I've got a T.T.Y.
out to law enforcement,

480
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:41,973
and we've added him
to the "most wanted" list.

481
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:46,926
It's a brick wall
on the john doe I've been working.

482
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,970
Someone high up on the food chain
doesn't want anyone knowing who he is.

483
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,495
He a suspect in another case?

484
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:54,004
Maybe. Either way, I haven't
shared this with Chambers yet.

485
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,145
Probably smart.
See what pans out first.

486
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:58,260
You know anyone in Justice
who owes you a solid,

487
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,764
might like to go off the record.

488
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:01,528
Justice keeps their nose clean.

489
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:04,738
Try Harold Stone, N.S.A.
He's a friend. Use my name.

490
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:08,047
N.S.A.? You got skeletons
in the closet I don't know about?

491
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,940
Not half as many as you.
I'll be back in two hours.

492
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:48,623
I thought you
wanted me to move to New York.

493
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,933
I do. I do.

494
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:55,285
I thought we'd move there together.

495
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,603
I'm not going anywhere, Jay.

496
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,318
And in two months,

497
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:07,433
when you and the boys

498
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,865
get this whole road trip
out of your system,

499
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:15,066
I'll be waiting.

500
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,728
<i>I'm not going anywhere, Jay.</i>

501
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,108
Is there a problem?

502
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
Sit down.

503
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:21,807
It's okay. Let me handle this.

504
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:23,359
Please.

505
00:36:43,296 --> 00:36:45,677
Never one for a subtle entrance,
were you, Will?

506
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:48,605
That's why I always liked
training with you.

507
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:49,993
Kept things exciting.

508
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:57,193
Guess the rumor's true.

509
00:36:57,928 --> 00:36:59,182
They killed your girlfriend?

510
00:36:59,357 --> 00:37:01,961
I need information. Triggerman.

511
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:03,747
I'm not in the loop, Will.

512
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,940
While you were living
the ivy league lifestyle,

513
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,562
I've been playing
the good wife... to that.

514
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:10,855
I don't know what the assignment is,

515
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,090
but I'm gonna keep doing it...
and him... because that's the job.

516
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,707
Well, they crossed the line.

517
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,673
Maya was never part of the assignment.

518
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,101
The way I heard it,

519
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,329
you went off-book with the Drexler job,

520
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,909
took matters into your own hands.

521
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:25,622
- It still got done.
- Done wrong,

522
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:27,329
since you screwed up, Will.

523
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:29,731
When they sent me to Yale two years ago,

524
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,626
they told me
I was protecting my country.

525
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:34,958
- I didn't sign on to murder civilians.
- You're not a student.

526
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:38,647
You're a soldier.
You, me... we follow orders.

527
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:41,218
And when we don't,
there are repercussions

528
00:37:42,806 --> 00:37:44,144
or did you forget that?

529
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,687
Don't make me.

530
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:11,703
Sorry, Will. Orders.

531
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:27,843
Who killed Maya?

532
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:29,062
I don't know.

533
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,690
Tell me.

534
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:44,438
All I know is,

535
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,293
word got out that Traveler's gone rogue.

536
00:38:48,003 --> 00:38:50,504
They want you brought in.
That's all I got.

537
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:52,188
Who gave the order?

538
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:54,118
I don't know.

539
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:57,441
I swear! I swear.

540
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:02,417
You've got something they want.

541
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,128
Don't leave me like this.

542
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,571
You're not the one I want dead.

543
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,404
I need you.

544
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,835
I just got off the phone
with Harold Stone at N.S.A.

545
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:36,333
John doe has a name...
Otis Whaley. No priors.

546
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:39,457
No priors? Then why is his name
on the classifieds?

547
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,974
- Why is he even in the system?
- He's not a suspect.

548
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:44,876
He's an undercover federal agent
out of counterterrorism.

549
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:46,455
He's one of us.

550
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:48,829
Keep digging. Sir!

551
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:51,078
We got a hit. Eddie Hahn...
friend of Tyler Fog's.

552
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,805
Works at Fog financial,
had a $100m deal closing today.

553
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:56,039
- Never showed up this morning.
- Calls to his home?

554
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,513
Nothing. Same with his cell.

555
00:39:57,635 --> 00:39:59,447
Not his M.O.,
according to his assistant.

556
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,745
<i>Federal agents.</i>

557
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,214
Come on, Jay.

558
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:44,018
Tell me you got out of there.

559
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:51,725
Marlow, behind me, alleyway.

560
00:40:56,776 --> 00:40:57,776
No, no radio.

561
00:40:58,339 --> 00:40:59,570
We don't want to spook him.

562
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:00,882
Just spread the word.

563
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:13,304
He's running!

564
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:15,498
Call it in!

565
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:19,121
Out of the way!
