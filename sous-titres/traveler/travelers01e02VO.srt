1
00:00:00,736 --> 00:00:02,386
<i>Previously on </i>Traveler...

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:05,319
It's time to say goodbye
to the castle. Shotgun !

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:06,568
<i>Three best friends...</i>

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,922
You head down first. I'll be right
behind you, taping the whole thing.

5
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:12,316
<i>... and one innocent prank...</i>

6
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:14,505
<i>lead to an unthinkable betrayal.</i>

7
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,832
<i>- Did you get out?</i>
- Yeah, we're at the corner.

8
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,061
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm sorry. I had to do this.</i>

9
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,609
Do what?

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,890
You think Will framed us for this?

11
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:27,742
Will apologized right before
the museum exploded,

12
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:29,125
and our faces are on tv!

13
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:31,015
<i>Now, to clear their names...</i>

14
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,752
<i>A friend of us was in the building.
His name's Will Traveler.</i>

15
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:36,313
We found your friend
Traveler in the museum... dead.

16
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,294
<i>... they're on the run...</i>

17
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:40,251
The only people you trust
are each other.

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,395
Son, what the hell did I just see on tv?

19
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:44,025
But, dad, we weren't involved.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,391
<i>... trying to unravel the mystery.</i>

21
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,667
I've done as you asked.
They'll be here tonight.

22
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:55,945
Jay, you can't run from this.

23
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,606
I need to figure out
who Will Traveler really is.

24
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,197
New york field office.

25
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,144
You need to
contact the bureau in Chicago.

26
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,619
I'm afraid L.A. is outside
our current search radius.

27
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:17,586
But Jay Burchell's threat was a bluff.

28
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:20,133
The bomb squad came up empty
at the Brooklyn Bridge.

29
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:23,336
We managed to get photos
on the N.G.A. Satellite flyby.

30
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,851
They caught our van being hit
by Burchell and Fog's accomplice.

31
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:28,657
What we know from forensics

32
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:31,303
is that the unsub used
a .45 to kill our men

33
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,756
and c-4 to blow up the van.

34
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:35,214
After that, they crossed into
Queens and pulled a houdini.

35
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:36,604
What's our current action?

36
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:38,909
N.Y.P.D.'s blanketing
the county train stations,

37
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,861
taxi companies,
used car dealers.

38
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:44,220
Port authority has checkpoints on
bridges and tunnels out of the city.

39
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:46,849
Tyler Fog made two calls
to his father earlier today.

40
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:49,110
We're still working on
a location for Carlton Fog.

41
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,131
But we're 90% it's one of his houses.

42
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:53,335
SWAT's en route to Fog's
farmhouse in Massachusetts

43
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:56,055
his mansion in the hamptons
and his penthouse

44
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:58,957
- in case they double back.
- Okay, now get me a full location.

45
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:09,928
- Slow down.
- Relax.

46
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:11,831
We're almost at my dad's.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,516
<i>It's been nine hours...</i>

48
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,164
<i>... since the bombing
in new york's oldest art museum.</i>

49
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:18,848
<i>The two suspects, graduated students</i>

50
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:22,171
<i>Tyler Fog and Jay Burchell
remain at large.</i>

51
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,708
<i>Federal state and city officials
are continuing to use...</i>

52
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,441
Still no mention of Will.

53
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:32,348
Well, it takes a while
to identify the body.

54
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:36,396
What about your dad?

55
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,414
Any idea what he's got in mind?

56
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:41,452
He's calling in favors,

57
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,077
bringing in lawyers, political contacts.

58
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,347
Whatever can help us out.

59
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,470
<i>Domination!</i>

60
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:49,387
You're too slow, Jay.

61
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,317
The Traveler win streak continues.

62
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:53,476
It's 6 months in a row now ?

63
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,586
That was closer.
I'm gonna beat your skinny ass.

64
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,804
Oh, I own you, Jay.
I will always own you.

65
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,685
You know why you lose?

66
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:02,298
- Why is that?
- Cause you don't want it badly enough.

67
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:03,857
Isn't that right, Tyler?

68
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,309
Hey, shouldn't you be getting ready?

69
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,201
My dad can't make it.

70
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:11,435
He's on his way to Miami.

71
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,491
What? This... This dinner's been
on the books for two weeks.

72
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:19,310
He's been trying to buy
a shipping company for 2 years.

73
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,599
So that's how it is
in the Fog family.

74
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:23,799
Business comes first.

75
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:26,859
- Very nice. I like that attitude.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:29,165
Screw him. If he...

77
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:30,907
can't be bothered to show up for dinner,

78
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:32,998
we'll just put it on his tab

79
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,283
Carlton can pay for our fillets.

80
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:36,459
I'll second that.

81
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:39,747
He cut me off.

82
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,586
What?

83
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,569
My dad. He can't pay for dinner
'cause he cut me off.

84
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:53,289
That's why I'm living here with you guys
instead of out on my own.

85
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,296
That's why I'm back at school.

86
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:59,766
Tonight would've been the first night
I've seen him since, so...

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,045
- You paid for everything when we first
- Credit cards paid for it.

88
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:08,071
You could've said something.
You didn't have to step up like that.

89
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:09,293
Yeah, right.

90
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:11,380
Then I guess dinner's on me.

91
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,160
I mean, if you're down
with pizza and beer.

92
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,861
Hey, forget about it. He's your father.

93
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:20,017
I'm sure he had his reasons.

94
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:25,338
<i>He's your father.
I'm sure he had his reasons.</i>

95
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,919
What?

96
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:31,794
Damn it!

97
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,942
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What did I tell you?

98
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,183
Maybe he's not after us.

99
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,379
- He's not passing.
- I wasn't doing anything.

100
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,004
Will you slow down now?

101
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:05,082
Looks like we don't even have a choice.

102
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:24,350
Don't worry, all right?

103
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,670
We'll get by this.

104
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,919
This isn't good.

105
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:37,045
Just give it a min.
They're letting cars through.

106
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,851
Yeah, after they check them, Jay.

107
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:46,369
- They making a checkpoint.
- No, it's too far out.

108
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:49,448
- He's looking into cars!
- Relax. Okay?

109
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:54,752
They're looking for us.

110
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:00,260
- Screw this.
- What are you doing, ty?

111
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:02,569
Look, we can take back roads
to my dad's.

112
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:10,189
Hold up, here.

113
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:18,937
Go! Go!

114
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,724
- This is a bad idea.
- We would've been recognized.

115
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:25,856
Oh, and we won't be now?

116
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,089
It's better than waiting here
and get caught.

117
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,116
Me and my brother, we used
to race these roads as kids.

118
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,063
Hang on.

119
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:00,190
They're still coming.

120
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:03,266
- Come on, go!
- I'm doing the best that I can!

121
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:15,537
Pull over!

122
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:42,689
You...

123
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:46,817
I told you we'd lose him.

124
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:06,654
We can make the rest
on foot.

125
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:13,391
What are you doing?

126
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,259
Right now we are
two guys on a joyride.

127
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,123
- Let's keep it that way.
- They're here.

128
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:18,245
Let's go, Jay!

129
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:41,684
Subtitle : www.swsub.com

130
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:52,661
Agent Randall's handing out
the updated case file.

131
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,349
Burchell is our planner.

132
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,544
He's the son of a soldier,
and he had 2 years

133
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,032
of r.o.t.c. in college,

134
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:00,428
so we should assume he knows
how to handle a firearm.

135
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:02,898
Tyler Fog is the money behind the act

136
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,981
he's traveled extensively
in the middle east,

137
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,764
and Fog audited
chemical engineering classes at Yale.

138
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,535
It would be easy
to underestimate these guys

139
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:11,733
but the fact is,

140
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:14,590
they had reasons to target
President Shears' collection.

141
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:17,622
Shears was involved both in the
court-martial of Burchell's father

142
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:20,018
and in Carlton Fog's federal indictment.

143
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:23,649
The fact is Burchell and Fog
are on the run from us right now,

144
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,987
and two of our agents have died
trying to take them in.

145
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,510
We've all learned
that when we underestimate our enemies,

146
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,127
we make ourselves vulnerable.

147
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,989
Now call your wives,

148
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,449
your husbands, your kids, whoever...

149
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,275
and tell them that your day
is just geting started

150
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:43,378
and that you are not coming home
until Burchell and Fog are brought in.

151
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,586
Agents Marlow and Borjes
remain on point for the case.

152
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:48,368
All tips on locations go through them.

153
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,998
Let's get busy.

154
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,573
Please be careful with that.

155
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,852
I need it for work.

156
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:07,160
Hey, dad. No, I'm fine.

157
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,545
I can't talk right now.

158
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,665
FBI is here.

159
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,791
No, of course not.
They're looking into Jay.

160
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,683
Miss Doherty,
we need you to come with us.

161
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:20,815
We have a few questions
about your boyfriend.

162
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,302
You're not under arrest.

163
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:26,228
Dad?

164
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,008
I need to call you later.

165
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,385
Are you sure this is right?

166
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:52,287
- We just head north from the creek.
- No, is this the best move,

167
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:53,874
going to your dad's?

168
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,550
Are you kidding me?
You're bringing this up now?

169
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,465
You 2 haven't always been
on the best terms.

170
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,061
Where else do you wanna go?

171
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,639
The FBI?

172
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,917
Wait, that's right. The fbi
tried to kill us in the van today.

173
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,943
I'm just asking if you trust him.

174
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:11,275
Look, whatever happened between
me and my father is over, okay?

175
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:12,606
He was just testing me.

176
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:14,151
Why would he want to test you?

177
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,047
Because that's what dads do.

178
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,148
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

179
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,067
Look, I know you were forced
into fending for yourself, Jay.

180
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,652
My dad just wanted
to make me to do the same.

181
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:36,275
- You can fend for yourself.
- Yeah, I can. We can.

182
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:38,410
This is different!

183
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,967
My dad asked us to come up there,
then he's got a plan, so I trust him.

184
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,770
We can trust him.

185
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,012
Come on.

186
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,986
It's just, like, a little over a mile.

187
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:00,781
<i>This is Mass SWAT.
We're in position, New York.</i>

188
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,154
Roger that. Stand by.

189
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,023
East Hampton, Manhattan, report.

190
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:06,446
<i>We got East Hampton.
No activity reported.</i>

191
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,304
<i>Manhattan SWAT. Fog penthouse.</i>

192
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,022
<i>We're in position and online, sir.</i>

193
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,235
Okay, all units stand by.

194
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,616
Hold your positions,
and everyone wait on my command.

195
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,771
<i>Roger, New York.</i>

196
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:17,288
Welcome to Elysium.

197
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,746
Headquarters put a tap
on Tyler Fog's phone

198
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:24,396
this morning when he was in Manhattan.

199
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:27,069
Carlton asked Tyler
to come to a place called Elysium.

200
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:28,496
I couldn't find it on a map.

201
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:31,210
That's because it's a reference:
"Elysium" means "paradise."

202
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,201
It's usually called Elysian fields.

203
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,737
Relax, Jay.

204
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:39,690
My father built this place
in the '80s after his troubles.

205
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,854
It's got everything you need
to survive a national manhunt

206
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:46,369
or a messy divorce,
which is actually what he used it for.

207
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,813
Stop there!

208
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,471
Hands high and wide!

209
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,358
It's all right, Bob. That's my son.

210
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,355
Dad!

211
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,646
You're safe now, son. You're safe.

212
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,435
Sorry for the excitement.
We were expecting you by car.

213
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,474
It's okay. I wasn't worried.

214
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,275
- Yeah, right.
- Now relax, Jay. You're among friends.

215
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:17,045
Come on, let's get you two inside.

216
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,561
- You got something?
- They're going someplace rural.

217
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:41,566
The farmhouse.
Mass SWAT, you got a green light.

218
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,913
Roger, new york. We're moving in.

219
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,316
Have you found out anything about Will?

220
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,594
I'm afraid your friend's
proving elusive.

221
00:13:57,764 --> 00:14:00,947
- But what about his hometown?
- Deer Harbor? We checked.

222
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,863
There's no listing
for Will Traveler in all of Maine.

223
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,307
- And Kim?
- Your girlfriend is probably

224
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,328
being questioned by the fbi right now.

225
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,050
Well, then we need to help her...

226
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:12,694
You need to calm down.

227
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:14,469
You're exhausted, and I bet

228
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:16,779
you
can't remember the last time you ate.

229
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,928
<i>Mass SWAT, proceed with caution.</i>

230
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,778
<i>These men are armed and dangerous.</i>

231
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,338
So who did the cooking
in your house, Jay?

232
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,437
Excuse me, sir?

233
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:37,278
Who did the cooking,
your mother or your father?

234
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,455
Honestly, I- I can't remember.

235
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:41,818
Look, sir, all due respect,

236
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,816
I didn't come here
to talk about my family.

237
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:46,812
You came for answers.We'll get to them.

238
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,361
<i>We're moving in.</i>

239
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,699
- Who are all these people?
- My security detail.

240
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:07,450
What about the guy I saw
in the window when we arrived?

241
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:12,692
Approaching the kitchen.

242
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,490
We have movement.

243
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:27,052
Down! Get down!

244
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,802
Go! Take him!

245
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,366
Gentlemen...

246
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,242
Jon Ellington.

247
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,250
Carlton?

248
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,416
Your farmhouse in Massachusetts
was just hit by a SWAT team.

249
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:51,684
We should make this quick.

250
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,585
This place is supposed to be
off the grid.

251
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:54,871
We have secure phone lines...

252
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:57,147
Either way,
I think we should do this now.

253
00:15:58,437 --> 00:15:59,437
All right.

254
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,868
What's Fallbrook Dunn?

255
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,721
You guys rember
the vice president's ties

256
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,613
to the california energy crisis?

257
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:16,838
Right. Nobody does.

258
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:20,509
That's 'cause Fallbrook Dunn
swept it under the carpet.

259
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:22,881
They're the cleanup hitters
for heads of state,

260
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:25,305
and they've rescued the careers
of a lot of congressmen,

261
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:27,803
and I hired 'em to save your asses.

262
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,346
Come on. It's getting cold.

263
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,869
Hamptons, Manhattan,
you got a green light.

264
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:39,100
And make sure Carlton Fog
knows you were there.

265
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,274
Roger that.

266
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,404
They won't find anything, sir.

267
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,367
But it will send a message.

268
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,486
I still want that location, Marlow.

269
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,212
What's this?

270
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,691
It's a portable polygraph machine.

271
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,896
We use them for intake interviews
with new clients.

272
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,936
- Why would we lie?
- You wouldn't... Outwardly.

273
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:15,116
I've never heard of a firm
that does this to their own clients.

274
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,678
We're not a law firm, Mr. Burchell.

275
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,966
- It's for our protection.
- But if we hired you,

276
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,833
you should be worried
about protecting us.

277
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,502
These are our rules.
If you won't abide by them,

278
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,572
then we're just wasting
each other's time here.

279
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:29,159
It's fine. They'll do it.

280
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:32,970
Think of it as practice.
I speak from experience.

281
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,793
It takes more than one polygraph
to clear your name.

282
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:46,410
Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss Doherty.

283
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,176
<i>- Thank you for coming in.</i>
- Irish girl from Rockaway Beach.

284
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:51,870
- This ought to be fun.
<i>- I'm special agent Jan Marlow,</i>

285
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,553
<i>and I have to remind you
that you're not under arrest,</i>

286
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:56,379
but you are entitled to a lawyer

287
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,491
- if you'd like one for the interview.
- Sure.

288
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:02,562
- You'd like me to bring you a lawyer?
- Yeah, his name's Jay Burchell,

289
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,162
<i>and he's innocent of whatever
charges there are against him.</i>

290
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,184
Excellent so far, Mr. Burchell.

291
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:09,870
When are we gonna talk about Will?

292
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:11,675
Would you like to talk about him now?

293
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,012
What do you want to know?

294
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,678
Did Will Traveler come up
with the idea for this trip?

295
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,097
- That depends. We all three...
- Yes or no answers, please.

296
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:22,722
Did Will Traveler come up

297
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,784
- with the idea for this trip?
- Yes.

298
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,537
Did you ever help will Traveler
handle explosives?

299
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:31,007
What kind of question is that?

300
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:37,408
Did you ever help will Traveler
handle explosives?

301
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,016
You're lying, Mr. Fog.

302
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:43,281
Let's try again.

303
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:48,433
I once used nitroglycerin to break
into a friend's house.

304
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:53,313
Will showed us how to bust a door lock
with it, but it was just a...

305
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,361
It was just a prank.

306
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,476
Look, I am tired of this.
You keep talking about Jay,

307
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:05,159
and you should be looking into Will.

308
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,575
Will Traveler,
who doesn't seem to exist.

309
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,545
We have no record anywhere
of will Traveler,

310
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,246
- not even in university housing...
- Has she got anything yet?

311
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,941
Not yet.
Bu she'll get there.

312
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,850
You're a photographer,
you don't have a single picture of him?

313
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:21,410
I explained that he avoided cameras.

314
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:23,743
But if you want a picture...

315
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:25,785
how about this?

316
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:29,865
Agent Marlow, you're needed
in the strategy room.

317
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,357
Borjes said it's urgent.

318
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,848
Did will ever mention
that he had military training?

319
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,218
What is with these questions?

320
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,783
You know something about Will
that you're not telling us?

321
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:45,592
Do you hold the U.S. government
responsible for your father's death?

322
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,161
You work in an art gallery,
Miss Doherty.

323
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:55,164
I mean, I know you're an artist,
but you have a day job.

324
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,036
- Have you ever sold a forgery?
- No.

325
00:19:58,158 --> 00:19:59,346
How can you be so sure?

326
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,722
Because we check the details
of our paintings...

327
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:03,580
The brushstrokes, the provenance.

328
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,987
- What's this have to do with Jay?
- We do the same thing on every case,

329
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,285
and when I adapt the details
about your boyfriend

330
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:11,669
I'm not buying.

331
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,584
Yeah, well, you don't know him.

332
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,199
Maybe you don't either.

333
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:18,816
Did Will ever mention
that he knew your father?

334
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,030
Last question.

335
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:24,077
When I say the name "Will Traveler" now,

336
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:25,718
what do you think?

337
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:28,657
Open answer.

338
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:36,094
What do I think?

339
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,358
I think my best friend turned
out to be an enemy of the state.

340
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,500
Is this an interrogation
or an interview?

341
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:52,280
Answer the question, please.

342
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:54,910
- Do you hold the government resp...
- I'm done with this.

343
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:57,004
- Mr. Burchell...
- I said I'm done with this.

344
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,744
Your boyfriend phoned in
another bomb threat

345
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,846
in order to save Tyler Fog
from my men.

346
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:07,161
- That's a federal offense.
- He was scared.

347
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,851
He said people
knew this was gonna happen.

348
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,424
Like the people he was working with?

349
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:16,361
The people who killed two of my men

350
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,134
so that your boyfriend and Tyler Fog
could escape the city?

351
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:26,285
I'm not going anywhere, Jay.

352
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,914
And in two months,

353
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,826
when you and boys

354
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:37,009
get this whole road trip
out of your system...

355
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,160
I'll be waiting.

356
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:47,550
I'll be waiting.

357
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:52,459
Jay's not a killer.

358
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,683
Fallbrook Dunn is recommending
you leave the country immediately.

359
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,283
- What?
- It's your best option.

360
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:09,240
At least until we can get a name
and apply the appropriate pressure.

361
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,203
But we've got a name. Will Traveler.

362
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:13,392
A ghost who, according
to your interviews,

363
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:15,861
has taught you to build
improvised explosive devices.

364
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:17,510
This is the best lead we have, right?

365
00:22:17,632 --> 00:22:20,425
And you're asking the only 2
material witnesses to leave the country.

366
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,276
Switzerland has strong extradition laws.
We can contact you...

367
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:25,129
What about extraordinary rendition?

368
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,450
What the hell is that?

369
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:29,902
The U.S. has been known
to kidnap terror suspects abroad.

370
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:32,628
We'll make arrangements to prevent that.

371
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,298
That's not something you can prevent.

372
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,731
How long would we have
to leave the country? A month?

373
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:37,999
A year?

374
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,482
It makes sense, Jay!

375
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:44,342
Now you want Will to be the answer here,

376
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,717
but somebody's made sure
that he can't help your case.

377
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,260
Then we dig deeper.

378
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:50,777
I am not leaving Kim
to deal with this mess.

379
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,481
When the sky starts falling,
she'll leave you.

380
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:56,513
I know. Trust me.

381
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,462
You don't know her.

382
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:04,455
Pull your hand out. Slowly.

383
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:19,025
Kim is the only person
who has actually tried to help us.

384
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,159
Come on, Jay.

385
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:23,211
Let's just get somewhere safe,
and then we can build our case.

386
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,336
You don't get it!

387
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:27,057
Your life is the same
whether you're here

388
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,202
or 3,000 miles away.

389
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,839
My life is here.

390
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,065
So could this be Will Traveler?

391
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,161
Too early to tell for sure,
but the age, height

392
00:23:52,283 --> 00:23:54,967
and weight range all match
your girl's description.

393
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,975
You know what they say...
If the craniofacial makeup fits...

394
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:00,347
I owe you a beer, Jenny.

395
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:02,521
With this case, I won't hold my breath.

396
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,851
Miss Doherty.

397
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,099
I've been here all night.
They said I could go home.

398
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:14,600
I looked into Will Traveler.

399
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,991
If this guy does exist,
and I'm not saying he does,

400
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:18,427
then he's probably in our morgue,

401
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:20,942
- burnt beyond recognition.
- Meaning he was in the Drexler.

402
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,741
Right now,
Traveler can't help your boyfriend.

403
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:32,031
This could be it!

404
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,548
- We set up for a T&T?
- Yes, sir.

405
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:39,112
If it's Burchell, keep him on the line.
If you let him know you're here,

406
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:41,482
I will arrest you
for obstructing justice. Clear?

407
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:42,898
Quiet the hell down!

408
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:54,954
Has the FBI contacted you?

409
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,041
Good. They're probably monitoring
your phones, so we'll keep it short.

410
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:03,153
He's using VOIP heavily encrypted.

411
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:05,538
- Can we pull a number?
- Just takes more time.

412
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:08,209
<i>Look, I made a mistake.</i>

413
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:10,438
I came up here,

414
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,928
somewhere where I thought I'd get help,
and I am not finding it.

415
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:15,748
How are you?

416
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:18,088
How am I?

417
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:22,550
<i>I've been better. Look have you had
any luck finding a picture of Will?</i>

418
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:26,037
Is there anything on the news yet?

419
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:29,314
Kim, what's going on?

420
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:31,877
Is this a bad time to talk?

421
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,624
- Five seconds to a number.
- No, it's fine.

422
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,748
We lost the trace.

423
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,565
I got a partial.
We can check it with N.S.A.

424
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:47,622
I'm sorry.

425
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,581
The phone just dropped the call.

426
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:53,353
Randall,
take Ms. Doherty back to your office

427
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:54,869
in case Burchell calls back.

428
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,229
Yes, sir.

429
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,037
This is a big deal for me.

430
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:09,814
New job, new apartment.

431
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:10,996
New York.

432
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,536
I thought you wanted me
to move to new york.

433
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:16,748
I do. I do.

434
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,621
I just thought
we'd move there together.

435
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:26,632
I'm not going anywhere, Jay.

436
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:29,450
<i>Thought we'd move there together.</i>

437
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:42,139
Can I help you find something there?

438
00:26:44,722 --> 00:26:46,252
I was... I was looking for a computer.

439
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,885
I just wanted to check on Will myself.

440
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,645
I'm sorry about
the rough treatment last night.

441
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:54,136
There's an old saying...

442
00:26:54,684 --> 00:26:57,250
"the sins of the father
shall be visited upon the son."

443
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,545
After my problems with the government,

444
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,954
I swore to myself
that I'd never let anything like that

445
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,503
happen to Tyler or his brother.

446
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:07,384
I'm not sure Europe is any safer
than staying here, sir.

447
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:11,346
Are you leery of Fallbrook Dunn,

448
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:12,967
or of me?

449
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:14,647
I just don't trust this guy Ellington.

450
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:17,737
I mean, how well do you really know him?

451
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:19,385
I don't.

452
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:23,534
I don't.
I asked the firm to send someone

453
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,024
who could make Saddam Hussein
look like a saint.

454
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:28,502
I trust they sent the best guy.

455
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:30,926
You know,

456
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,547
I have always been impressed
by your initiative.

457
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:37,312
You're a self-starter. I like that.

458
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,351
Thank you, sir.

459
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:42,721
Unfortunately,
it's a trait that Tyler lacks.

460
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:49,018
He can't really handle
life's complications,

461
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,701
not on his own.

462
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:53,048
He needs you to be there for him.

463
00:28:09,043 --> 00:28:10,122
Take care, son.

464
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:12,815
I love you.

465
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:18,117
I love you, too, dad.

466
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,393
Switzerland's an amazing place, Jay.

467
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,059
It's not true, dad.

468
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:28,358
No, dad,
I can handle things myself, okay?

469
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,241
Yeah. No, I get it.

470
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:38,362
You're trying
to teach me a lesson, right?

471
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:40,032
Father of the year. I'm grateful.

472
00:29:40,842 --> 00:29:42,057
Unbelievable.

473
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,051
Another fight with Carlton?

474
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,894
Guy sounds like a jerk.

475
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:53,756
Yeah, but who knows the real story?

476
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:55,386
Has he said anything to you?

477
00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:00,299
But I don't know.
Maybe it'll be good for him, you know,

478
00:30:00,427 --> 00:30:01,762
learning to live on his own?

479
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:05,090
Anyway, if it weren't for Carlton,
Tyler wouldn't even be here.

480
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:09,504
<i>Anyway, if it weren't for Carlton,
Tyler wouldn't even be here.</i>

481
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:17,707
Glad you chose to join us, Mr. Burchell.

482
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:21,841
You guys do this type of thing a lot?

483
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:24,253
More often than you might think.

484
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:28,533
Don't worry, Mr. Burchell.

485
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,121
If your time abroad extends,

486
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,570
we can always arrange
to have Ms. Doherty brought over.

487
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,540
Europe is a photographer's dream.

488
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,850
Watch out!

489
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,981
Stay down, out of sight.

490
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:49,254
I'll handle this.

491
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,601
What did you tell him about Kim?

492
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:09,819
What?

493
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:11,864
I never told him she was a photographer.

494
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,105
It's his job to know the details.

495
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,836
Dude, she's coming. She's coming.

496
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:23,431
Holy...

497
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:29,351
Go!
That guy is not here to help us!

498
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,580
Sir, you can just
contact the bureau in Chicago.

499
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:09,457
Sir, can I have a word
about the case file?

500
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:11,156
You did good work today.

501
00:32:11,301 --> 00:32:13,211
Thank you, sir,
but that's not why I'm here.

502
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:15,440
I think we're making a mistake

503
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,716
by assuming Burchell and Fog
are alone in this.

504
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:19,466
No one's assuming anything.

505
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:22,170
I said the one thing
we shouldn't do is make assumptions.

506
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:24,094
It's just, typically,
terrorists strike out

507
00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:25,956
for political reasons,
not personal ones.

508
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,538
Tell that to Timothy McVeigh's victims..

509
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:30,965
Yes, but if I were running that,

510
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,107
- I would have given...
- You're not, though.

511
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:34,399
Are you?

512
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:39,241
Agent Marlow, we both know
there's only one reason

513
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:41,363
that I'm in charge
of this unit instead of you.

514
00:32:41,521 --> 00:32:45,543
Now if you catch these guys,
close up this case.

515
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,406
No one will remember
the mistakes you've made in the past.

516
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,379
Are we going to have
a problem here, Marlow?

517
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:55,521
No, sir.

518
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:57,021
Good.

519
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:01,289
Let me know when you have
something constructive.

520
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:30,483
Locked.

521
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,460
Help me find the phone.

522
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,224
We should call my dad just
in case Ellington comes back.

523
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:55,462
Yeah, or maybe your father
knew about this.

524
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:57,810
My father hired that firm,
not Ellington.

525
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,680
Tyler, the gun!

526
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:06,522
Get up!

527
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,124
Hello. Wake up!

528
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,333
Who are you?

529
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:28,232
Who are you working for?

530
00:36:36,598 --> 00:36:38,255
Did my father know about this?

531
00:36:40,286 --> 00:36:41,462
You tell me.

532
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:45,680
Your father
is the least of your worries.

533
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,989
Yes?

534
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:06,480
<i>The package is ready?</i>

535
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:10,364
It's done.

536
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:21,627
There was never
gonna be a plane, was there?

537
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,707
Tell us who hired you.

538
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,740
- Now they want us dead?
- Who hired you?!

539
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:33,499
Pull the trigger.

540
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Do it.

541
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:49,049
Jay, grab his keys.

542
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:54,118
Let's go.

543
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:21,511
<i>Good morning.</i>

544
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:25,210
<i>It's just after 7:00 a.m.
here on the east coast,</i>

545
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:27,563
<i>and, as we face a new day,</i>

546
00:38:28,118 --> 00:38:29,411
<i>I am here to assure you</i>

547
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:33,465
<i>that the unsettling events of yesterday
will not change America.</i>

548
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:38,328
<i>From all accounts, we have been
struck by an enemy within,</i>

549
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:42,226
<i>and we will not rest until the people
who are responsible</i>

550
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:43,693
<i>are brought to justice.</i>

551
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:47,499
<i>Every resource at my disposal
has been mobilized,</i>

552
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:49,370
<i>because we will not tolerate</i>

553
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:52,990
<i>the loss of even one
american life to terrorism.</i>

554
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,304
Franklin P.D. called.

555
00:38:56,497 --> 00:38:57,876
Found an abandoned car in a ditch,

556
00:38:58,006 --> 00:38:59,067
purchased in Queens.

557
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:00,424
- Location?
- Upstate,

558
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,678
just off property owned
by Dante Defense Systems.

559
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:04,366
Let me guess... a Fog company.

560
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:06,032
Elysium. You were right.

561
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,313
I'm always right.

562
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:27,433
This is what your life is gonna be like

563
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:29,198
until your boyfriend comes in.

564
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,543
This isn't standard practice, is it...

565
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:38,383
you giving me a ride home?

566
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,624
We're gonna be on the same side
in this, Ms. Doherty.

567
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,151
It's time for you to accept that.

568
00:40:23,883 --> 00:40:25,021
What are you doing?

569
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:27,015
I want to go back.

570
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:29,530
He didn't know about this.

571
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:31,572
He wouldn't sell us out.

572
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:35,914
He cut me off.

573
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,596
That's why I'm living here with you
instead of out on my own.

574
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,120
Anyway, if it weren't for Carlton,

575
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:41,451
Tyler wouldn't even be here.

576
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:44,400
He can't really handle
life's complications.

577
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:46,202
He needs you to be there for him.

578
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:48,137
I trust that they sent the best.

579
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:55,330
Either way...

580
00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:58,310
we can't go back.

581
00:41:03,707 --> 00:41:04,787
It's just us now.

582
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:37,600
- What's the status?
- <i>Burchell and Fog have been eliminated.</i>

583
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:40,719
Good.
