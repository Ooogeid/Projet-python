1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,840
What the...?

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,190
Where do you think you're going?

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,930
I mean, you just don't think i can let you...

4
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:00,790
Excuse me?

5
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,620
Is there a trick to getting some help around here?

6
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,870
Other then being charming and beautiful, no, ma'am.

7
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,750
I need to know which of these to buy--
the 3000-z or the 3000-z-x.

8
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,620
Excellent question.

9
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,120
Uh, you need to talk to one of our green shirts about that.

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,200
I can actually call one to assist you.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,190
I'm not a salesman.

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm actually part of the nerd herd.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,350
You must be so proud of yourself.

14
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,410
I wouldn't go so far as to say proud.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,020
So sorry.

16
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,600
One einute.

17
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,680
I'll be right back.

18
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:45,470
Chanting: mystery crisper.

19
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,540
Guys, sorry, sorry to break up...

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,010
You want in?
It's gonna cost you five bucks.

21
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,570
What's going on?

22
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,180
Final round.Mystery crisper.

23
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,740
Chanting: mystery crisper!
Mystery crisper!

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,810
The great crisper, where employee food goes to die.

25
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,640
????

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,610
Guys, there's going to be a riot on the sales
floor if you don't get back to work.

27
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,690
Chuck, shut up.

28
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,320
??

29
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,200
????

30
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,120
He's got it?

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,460
He's the man, the man.

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,200
He wants his weapon.

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,810
Morgan is so awesome.
He can eat anything.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,610
Bartowski.

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,700
Yeah!
Yes!

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,460
I need to see you in my office.

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,190
I-i was just on my way.

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,640
Daddy mad, chuck.
Daddy mad.

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,950
Might as well kiss that promotion good-bye.

40
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,020
- Get in here, bartowski.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,110
Tell me...

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,130
What's the best part of being buy more brass?

43
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,730
The power?

44
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,350
The money?

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,410
The ladies?

46
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,320
The medical.

47
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,270
I couldn't give a rodent's behind about this job.

48
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,230
But this...

49
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,510
My body is my temple.

50
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,440
And i must treat it as such.

51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,520
Is that...
Is that all, sir?

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,920
'Cause i-i really should, uh, get back to work.

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
- No, that is not all.Sit down.
- Okay.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,890
There's a guy coming in here from corporate to interview you

55
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,270
and tang for the assistant manager spot.

56
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,870
Now tang's has the charm of a prostate exam.

57
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,810
For some reason, people seem to like you.

58
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,760
If the hr guy likes you, the job is yours.

59
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,970
So is the medical.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,330
Don't screw up.

61
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,990
I'll, uh, i'll do my best.

62
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,940
Make sure morgan does his best, too.

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,740
That kid is gonna be the anchor around your neck, bartowski.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,870
What, we don't have enough actual cobwebs already?

65
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm getting ready for our annual halloween party.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,310
What time are you getting here?

67
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,300
Oh, you know what, i might be late.

68
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,660
They finally scheduled that
promotional-interview thing for that afternoon.

69
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,990
We can just make it an assistant manager party, too, then.

70
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,980
Sure, yeah, if you feel like jinxing it.

71
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,080
You're just finally growing up, aren't you?

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,150
Do you think that this year would be a good time for you

73
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,890
and morgan to have separate costumes?

74
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,870
Excuse me, but what's wrong with our costume?

75
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,220
Um, i'm sorry, but the whole
two-man-sea-cucumber-thing is kind of creepy.

76
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,220
First of all, it's a sandworm, okay?

77
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,700
Shai-hulud, to be specific.

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,380
And second of all, dune fans have been going
nuts over our costume since the eighth grade.

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,330
Captain: yo.

80
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,540
Chuckster.

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,770
Guess what i am?

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,400
You're...

83
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,430
Naked?

84
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,380
I'm adam.

85
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,470
You know, like adam and eve, adam.

86
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,670
Wait till you see my snake.

87
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,540
I don't want to see your snake.

88
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,420
Devon, chuck here has an interview on wednesday.

89
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,610
That is outstanding.

90
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,170
I gotta...
Excuse me.

91
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,150
Hello?
Hello?

92
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,250
I'm getting tense!

93
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,800
You know i don't like being tense.

94
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,170
How can i help you relax, big mike?

95
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,540
Find that jackass morgan.

96
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,700
Your buddy's supposed to be working
a double shift today and went awol.

97
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,180
Hey, hey, buddy, morgan.

98
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,250
- Where you been?What's up, buddy?
- Yes.

99
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,420
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

100
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,850
I, uh, i picked up the sandworm costume from the dry cleaners.

101
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,810
The ranch dressing from last year totally came out,
so we're all good.

102
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,330
You ready to win another buy more costume contest?

103
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,190
No.No, no, 'cause you're
supposed to be at work, buddy.

104
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,210
Dude, i got ten big ones riding on this quote-unquote videogame,

105
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,560
so can i just have, uh...

106
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,750
This guy's been handing me my ass all week.

107
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,540
Time to return the favor.

108
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,240
????

109
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,600
- Uh, morgan.
- Yeah, buddy?

110
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,450
Morgan, this guy is dangerous.

111
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,090
Well, morgan's dangerous, chucky.
Morgan's dangerous.

112
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,180
Oh, what a baby.

113
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,070
What a loser.

114
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,030
How did you find me?
How did you find me?

115
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Who else knows i'm here?

116
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,050
Who do you work for?

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,060
No one.No one.
Let me go.

118
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,800
Look, i don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,950
I know you're a spy!

120
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,170
Your watch?

121
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,340
I designed that watch for the cia.

122
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,500
Are there other agents waiting for me outside?

123
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,410
Are there other agents waiting for me outside?

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,040
You're not sneaking away from me.

125
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
Wait, whoa, whoa.

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,210
You still owe me ten bucks!

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,340
Morgan!
Morgan!

128
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,340

Um, is sarah here?

She's waiting in your room.

Ellie: is everything okay?

136
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,050
Said she had a surprise for you.

137
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,610
Get in there, slugger.

138
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,660
Hey.

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,350
Who is this lazslo character?
He just id'd me as an agent.

140
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,790
Relax.We're looking into him.
And you did the right thing.

141
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,970
I...I didn't do anything.

142
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,140
I just flashed on the guy.

143
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,300
You followed protocol, and i'm going to
check in with you first thing in the morning.

144
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,290
Wait, wait.Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
Wait, um...

145
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,060
Look, if it's cool with you,
could you hang out for a little while?

146
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,220
Look, awesome and ellie think that i'm...

147
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,910
Kind of getting lucky in here,
and i wouldn't want to disappoint...

148
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,860
Them.

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,810
Uh, how long do you want me to stay?

150
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,860
42 minutes and 15 seconds?

151
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,430
Arcade fire's first album.

152
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,260
It's like an auditory aphrodisiac.

153
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,200
You're not really ready for it yet.

154
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,450
Here we go.

155
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,670
And...

156
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,220
Why were you waiting for me in my room, anyway?

157
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,190
Well, i wanted to surprise you.

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,450
Uh, it's, uh, it's us at comic-con.

159
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,000
What do you think?

160
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,770
It's...
It's great.

161
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,260
But we've never actually been to comic-con, have we?

162
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,270
Wow, we...

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,720
We actually look like a real couple.

164
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,730
Well, we are a real couple.

165
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,450
We're just a different sort of a couple.

166
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,840
That we are.

167
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,190
You!

168
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,520
What do i have to do to get timely
intel out of you, bartowski?

169
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,090
Look, i briefed sarah last night, all right?

170
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
Oh, i bet you did, slugger.

171
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,360
I thought we were all supposed to be part of the same team here,
huh-- team chuck.

172
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,900
We are, but i'm starting to feel like the guy

173
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,450
who always gets picked last,
and i do not like feeling like

174
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,170
Team chuck's little fat kid.

175
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,550
Okay, you know what, the next time i have a flash,
i'll come straight to you, all right, casey?

176
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,370
What did you tell lazslo?

177
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,180
Nothang.

178
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,270
He asked me where i got my watch,
and i told him my girlfriend gave it to me, okay?

179
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,850
So you compromised yourself and agent walker?

180
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,600
Bang up job, chuck.

181
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,630
And so now you and your son are ready to video-chat.

182
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,770
Thank you, young man.

183
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,280
You've been-- great heavens!

184
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,560
This is a whale-tail.

185
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,340
Notice this illusive creature,
seen here frolicking in her natural habitat--

186
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,630
- any sudden movement would-
- give  Me, give me this.

187
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,650
Come on, come on.

188
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,960
Get, shoo, shoo, shoo.

189
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,650
Have fun, go find the video games.

190
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,380
What was that about, man?

191
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,940
Come on, i was this close to closing a sale.

192
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,110
No.You know what you are, morgan?

193
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,870
You are this close to getting fired for sexual harassment.

194
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,830
What happened, chuck?
You used to be cool.

195
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,780
I-i used to be cool?

196
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,660
When was that?
When we were 13?

197
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,640
Well, i'm sorry to go changing on you, buddy.

198
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,040
But if you hadn't noticed,
we are now chronologically-speaking, adults.

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,320
So, unless you wanna work retail
for the rest of your life,

200
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,970
and by the way, drag me down
with you in the  Process,

201
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,990
i would suggest that you grow up.

202
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,940
"heavy is the head that wears the crown.

203
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,950
" couldn't help but notice the way you handled that,
uh, morgan situation.

204
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,100
That was most impressive, chuck.

205
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,470
That's great, that's great.

206
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,840
You gave me goose bumps.

207
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,680
Super, jeff.

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,030
The intersect was correct to alert us.

209
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,770
We've been looking for lazslo mahnovski

210
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,990
since he escaped from los robles
national labs last month.

211
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,990
Who is he?

212
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,210
Weapons designer.
Government brain.

213
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,820
The target graduated college age 14.

214
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,100
Ph.D.At 17.

215
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,190
Been with us ever since,
working for a clandestine engineering subcontractor.

216
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,220
Lazslo's not the kind of asset
we can afford to lose to our enemies.

217
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,870
Grade-a egghead.
Got it.

218
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,240
What do you want me to do with him?

219
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,380
Bring him in.
And take caution.

220
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,830
What, is he gonna hurt me with his mind?

221
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,130
Well, here's what he did to his handlers.

222
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,100
Nice try, buddy, but, uh,
halloween's tomorrow, okay?

223
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,470
Or today, or today.

224
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,300
It could be today if you want it to be today.

225
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,450
I didn't kill anybody.

226
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,760
Look, i-i never said you did.

227
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,070
Then why am i on the fbi list?

228
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,060
I don't know.
Just calm down.

229
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,210
I was framed, okay.

230
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,390
You have to believe me.
I am not a murderer.

231
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,810
Okay, okay.
I believe you.

232
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,050
But, fyi...

233
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,590
???

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,310
You told the undercover agent about me,
didn't you?

235
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,280
He's talking to pentagon operations right now.

236
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,480
I tapped into the encrypted video feed at the store.

237
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,020
I helped design that home theater system.

238
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,890
Look, i-i-i don't know-- gun!

239
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,770
Get it.Get it.
Get it.

240
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,280
I got it, i got it.
I got it.

241
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,050
Is that a water gun?

242
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,660
No.

243
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm pretty sure it's dripping on my face.

244
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,870
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,590
Name's lazslo.

246
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,930
And i need help.

247
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,840
What the hell am i supposed to do?

248
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
You're on the inside.

249
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,060
You have access.

250
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,220
Look, unless you help me clear my name,
they're gonna keep chasing me.

251
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,530
You're my only hope.

252
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,430
But first...

253
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,590
I could really use some pancakes.

254
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,230
Hey, where's chuck?

255
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,730
Shouldn't you guys be practicing your snake dance?

256
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,880
It's a sandworm, and...

257
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,100
Chuck's not here, 'cause he's probably off doing
something really mature like seeing an opera.

258
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,030
Or reading.

259
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,070
Come on, babe, let's help the little guy out.

260
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,010
What else did you make for the cia?

261
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,590
Whatever the jobs called for actually.

262
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,990
I mean, if an agent wanted thermal-vision ray bans

263
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,230
i'm the Guy they call.

264
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,690
You're like a real-life q?

265
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,370
You know.

266
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,630
You know q.

267
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,270
The guy who used to make all the gadgets for bond, q?

268
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,110
Bond was that spy-guy, right?

269
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,420
What, have they been keeping you in a friggin' cave?

270
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,170
Underground lab actually.

271
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,050
For the last 10 years,
all i did was work in that lab pretty much.

272
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,430
Well, that and play video games.

273
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,340
But, uh...

274
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,480
No friends, no family.

275
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,350
No bond.

276
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,450
No wonder you blew up all your
research and busted out there.

277
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,730
That's just inhumane.

278
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,310
So what kind of work do you do?

279
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,350
You know, it's kinda, it's kinda,
uh, complicated.

280
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,710
Right, but you gotta be some kind of a genius.

281
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,570
Or prodigy?

282
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,300
I mean feds don't bother recruiting somebody,

283
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,310
guarding them with undercover agents,
unless you're super-good  At sometthing?

284
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,120
What are you super-good at?

285
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,270
Let's just say i'm a computer-guy.

286
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,040
Morgan: ellie, let me ask you a question.

287
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,050
Am i the kind of person you'd categorize as...

288
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,680
Immature?

289
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,070
- Do you really want me to answer that?
- Yes.

290
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,610
Be straight with me.
Fire away both barrels.

291
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,820
Would you mind stepping in the kitchen for a moment, morgan?

292
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,130
I'll handle this one, honey.

293
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,750
Ellie's room.

294
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:46,430
There comes a time in every man's life when he reaches,
well, a crossroads.

295
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,960
A time when he must ask himself...

296
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,930
Am i a tucker?

297
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,370
Talking about your shirt, morgan.

298
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,140
I wasn't always a tucker, you know.

299
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,750
Then one day, it just happened.

300
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,300
How do you, how do you know it's time?

301
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,180
You just feel it.
Go ahead.x

302
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,690
Tuck her in.
See how she feels.

303
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,440
I don't know.

304
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,190
No, i'm, i'm just kinda happy
with how my shirts hang there.

305
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,920
Come on.

306
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,160
You're safe in here.

307
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,750
Tuck her in.

308
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,470
- I don't if i'm, i-
- do it.Mm-hmm.

309
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,420
I don't know, i-i kinda feel like my,
my junk's out there for the whole world to see.

310
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,540
Maybe that's the point, morgan.

311
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,430
Maybe that's the point.

312
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,820
If there's one thing to being a man,
it's always speaking your mind.

313
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,900
Whatever the cost.

314
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,000
Always be direct, open and honest.

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
When i was 12, i hid under ellie's bed,
so i could watch her undress.

316
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,360
Excellent.

317
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,160
What are you looking at?

318
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,930
Your hair.

319
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,870
It's time to tame the mane, buddy.

320
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,980
Let's talk product.

321
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,070
- I gotta finish the job.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,780
Hey, who's that handsome guy in the mirror?

323
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,510
This is great.

324
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,930
I mean just being able to sit in a coffee shop and talk.

325
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,300
Just talk.

326
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,980
With somebody who knows what
it's like working for the companq.

327
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,560
You know, if i had to do it over again,
i never would have gone to that pier.

328
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,900
What pier?

329
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,340
I was 11...

330
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,840
And...

331
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,500
Some agent saw me playing tetris at an arcade.

332
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,790
So he asked me if i can take all these tests.

333
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,350
The next thing i know,
he's offering to pay my way through school.

334
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,620
My parents, like, they didn't know what to do with a kid

335
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,190
whose iq is higher than both theirs combined.

336
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,800
So they signed me over.

337
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,390
And that's when i became property of
the united states government.

338
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,100
Sweet story, huh?

339
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,910
I'm a little, i'm a little strapped.

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,290
You know how government work pays.

341
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,100
Dude, yeah.

342
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,680
No, no, no, no, don't even worry about it.

343
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,210
Here.
Here's an iou.

344
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,570
Thanks.

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,330
Chuck, listen you can't tell
your handlers you ever saw me.

346
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
What?Why?

347
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,140
They can help you, lazslo.
They're the good guys.

348
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,960
There's no such thing in this business.

349
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,310
I mean, you don't believe me?

350
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,880
Go home and search your room.

351
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,060
See what kind of bugs your good guy handlers planted on you.

352
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,510
From now on, you should trust your handlers
precisely as much as they trust you.

353
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,890
* what the hell are these?

354
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,100
Seems you already know, chuck.

355
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,130
I can't believe you've been prying
into my most intimate moments...

356
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,610
You know what?

357
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,170
I swear to god, if i find out you've been spying on my sister,
i will kill you, casey.

358
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,220
Intimate moments?

359
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,870
Not really an issue thus far.

360
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,180
At least, not in the sense of traditional two-person intimacy.

361
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,830
He-he-he.

362
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,770
Do you have any idea how violated i feel right now?

363
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,710
You feel violated?

364
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,950
No, no, no, my ears feel violated.

365
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,370
'Cause they have to listen to you and
that moron morgan yammering on for four hours

366
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,320
about what sandwich  You're gonna take
if you were stranded on a deserted island.

367
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,210
What are you nuts?

368
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,110
Nobody was talking about sandwiches for four hours.

369
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,940
Come on.

370
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,300
Chuck: think about it-- this is a desert island, morgan.

371
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,500
Mayonnaise simply doesn't fare well in the tropics--

372
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,380
Morgan: oh, yeah, but define sandwich.

373
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,770
'Cause technically you can put anything
between two slices of bread.

374
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,620
For instance, could i bring...

375
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,990
A jessica alba sandwich to said desert island?

376
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,160
Chuck: i-i suppose.

377
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, i'll have you know,
i stand by my mayonnaise theory.

378
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,410
And you're still a giant douche for
spying on me like that.

379
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,060
Well, if it's any comfort, chuck,
we planted those bugs to protect you.

380
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,580
How did you find the surveillance,anyway?

381
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,700
Oh,a little birdie named lazslo told me.
What?

382
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,730
You contacted lazslo and didn't tell me?

383
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,900
I'm sorry,casey.

384
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,100
Did i violate your trust?

385
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,960
Willkommen to wienerlicious.

386
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,180
I'm sorry,but we're geschlossen--
and that's german for "closed.

387
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,720
" that's really adorable.

388
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,890
Nice cover,agent walker.

389
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,860
You ve a sec?

390
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,480
Hello,chuck.

391
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,510
What did you tell your handler?

392
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,690
I told him you were innocent,okay?

393
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,650
I told him,i thought you were innocent.

394
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,780
And i think the best thing for
you to do is go and turn yourself in.

395
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,500
They can help you.

396
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,860
Forget it,chuck.

397
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,470
It doesn't even matter.

398
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,380
Of course it matters.

399
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,350
Isn't this what you wanted?

400
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,670
They went through the trouble of framing me for murder.

401
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,450
What's going to happen when they get me back?

402
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,430
A slap on the wrist?

403
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,150
There's got to be someplace you can hide me.

404
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,610
Just for tonight.

405
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,630
There is one place.

406
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,550
So this kid just escaped?

407
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,260
Look,we tried everything we could to
prevent this whole thing from happening.

408
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,140
And what exactly is this?

409
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,630
A mentally unstable weapons designer,off his meds,
and currently running around los angeles.

410
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,740
And how do you know all this?

411
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,140
Lazslo was my asset.

412
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
I was the one who found him.

413
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,620
I was the one who trained him,and i'm definitely
the one who's going to be bringing him back.

414
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,460
Look,i'm just going to be
completely straight with you,walker.

415
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,840
We believe that he is looking to make a bomb.

416
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,690
And god help whoever's in his way
when lazslo decides to go off.

417
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,150
Welcome to buy more.

418
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,920
**

419
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,430
this is greate!

420
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,370
I'll be out before you guys open.

421
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,810
And if everything works out,
you will never see me again.

422
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,150
Thank you,chuck,for everything.

423
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,470
I really appreciate it.

424
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,540
Yeah,definitely.

425
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,710
Good luck disappearing,lazslo.

426
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,650
Yeah.

427
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,280
Oh,and i hope you don't mind,
i kind of helped myself to the...

428
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,300
To the bond ouevre.

429
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,020
Oh,check you out.

430
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,380
A view to a kill?

431
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,850
That's a bold choice.
Why?Is it a good one?

432
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,920
Oh,dude,christopher walken
playing some evil nazi villain?

433
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,470
Grace jones as some a 'roid rage sex assassin?

434
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,710
I think,actually,on second thought,
i'm going to stay for the beginning.

435
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,800
Sit.

436
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,230
Who is it?

437
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,740
Uh,it's my handler,sarah.

438
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,910
Chuck,you got to turn it off.

439
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,530
Please,chuck,she could be tracking us.

440
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
You don't understand.If you turn me in to your handlers,
it's like signing my death warrant.

441
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,630
Give me your watch.

442
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,920
Why?
Give me your watch.

443
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,410
I need to disable the transponder.

444
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,430
Disable the transponder?
transponder

445
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,320
Yeah,but how would you do that?

446
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,440
Here you go.

447
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,150
You were right about the bugs,by the way.

448
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,480
God knows what they put in my car.

449
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,680
I've got a pretty good idea.

450
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,560
I broke into it earlier,disabled the gps system.

451
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,770
How did you...

452
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,150
You designed my car.

453
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,140
Just think,chuck.

454
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,770
Right now,there is no one in the
entire world who knows where we are.

455
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,860
come on,chuck.Pick up the phone.

456
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,170
Hey,it's chuck.

457
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,200
I'll call you right back.

458
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,270
damn it.

459
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,030
Chuck,i want you to go to your car,
lock the doors and wait for me.

460
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,980
What did i tell you?

461
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,290
Max zorin is one of the greatest bad guys of all time.

462
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,460
You think walken was the bad guy?

463
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,180
What,are you kidding?

464
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,850
I mean,he did try to sink california into the pacific ocean.

465
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,870
What do you think?

466
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,000
Don't you get it,chuck?

467
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,680
Zorin is like us.

468
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,250
The nazis used him for his superior gifts
the way our government uses me and you.

469
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,380
I don't...
Too bad zorin didn't have this home theater system.

470
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,970
Screw flooding silicon valley.

471
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,210
Do you know what we can do with this system
if we really wanted to,chuck?

472
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,340
Watch more movies?

473
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,870
I haven't had a chance to play with
this bad boy since i designed it.

474
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,260
What is that?
Strategic air command.

475
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,850
We keep a fleet of b-2s in guam,
kept on nuclear alert,just in case.

476
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,210
What are you doing?

477
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,040
Putting my tax dollars to work,chuck.

478
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,090
Would you like to play a nice game of thermonuclear war?

479
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,960
What about texas?

480
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,450
What did texas ever do that was so great?

481
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,550
Nine hours...

482
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,690
Maybe we should pick somewhere closer?

483
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,950
In honor of max zorin...

484
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,630
Let's see how fast they get to san francisco.

485
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,730
Hey,hey,hey!

486
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,940
Um...

487
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,280
What about,let's watch goldfinger,huh?

488
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,050
What's it about?

489
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,490
Uh,again,it's about this bad,misunderstood guy
who just wants to blow up the world.

490
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,590
It's right up your alley;
i think you'll really like it.

491
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,220
We can always play later.

492
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,090
We can!

493
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,380
We can play...

494
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,680
Bomb,bomb,bomb...

495
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,190
Thing later...

496
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,870
I'm going to go get us some more popcorn.

497
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,010
So,here,why don't you...

498
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,280
You go ahead and start without me.

499
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,800
And-and,uh,i'm going to be right back.

500
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,030
You have 34 new messages.

501
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,990
Chuck,it's casey.

502
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,830
Call me.

503
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,410
You think this is funny,chuck?

504
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,720
If you don't call me back in the next ten seconds...

505
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,720
Tie it in a knot and shove it straight up...

506
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,270
chuck,i want you to go to your car,
lock the doors,and wait for me.

507
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,690
Where are we headed?

508
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,670
I thought i asked you to turn your phone off.

509
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,530
Who were you talking to?

510
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,640
My handler,okay?

511
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,290
She was just checking in.

512
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,280
You shouldn't have done that,chuck.

513
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,120
You should not have dragged them into this.

514
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
I'm not responsible for what happens now.

515
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,790
You sold me out...
You sold me out!

516
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,120
No,no,no,no.
I just didn't want you to get hurt,okay?

517
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,370
Look,relax.

518
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,230
Just relax,everything is going to be cool.

519
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,700
Everything is not going to be cool.

520
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,570
What the hell?

521
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,990
You're going to kill us!
You're going to kill us!

522
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,210
Well,chuck,it's been fun.

523
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,610
Don't...

524
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,010
Oh...Oh!

525
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,990
Hey.

526
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,580
You look nice.

527
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,870
Thanks.

528
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,060
I feel like crap.

529
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,650
I screwed up.

530
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,320
I severely pooched the lazslo situation last night.

531
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,950
Yeah,well...

532
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,650
Today,you have a job interview.

533
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,360
Do you think i care about making
lower management at a buy more?

534
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,080
Are you kidding me?

535
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,040
I aided and abetted the escape of
the next ted kacyzski,sarah.

536
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,870
I just...

537
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,410
I can't believe that i was so wrong about that guy.

538
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,980
No wonder you bugged my room.

539
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm an absolute idiot.

540
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,440
You know,just because you trust people,
it doesn't make you an idiot.

541
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,400
Yeah,well,i should've trusted you guys a little more.

542
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,890
I'm sorry.

543
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,220
Well,casey got a signal on your car,
and somehow the gps got turned back on

544
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,080
and lazslo was heading east.

545
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,650
So,i'll call you from the road.

546
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,870
And don't worry,we're going to bring him in,chuck.

547
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,700
Good luck today.

548
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,250
Morgan!

549
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,240
I don't know who you're supposed to be,
but that's the most kick-ass costume ever.

550
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,280
I'm sorry,michael.

551
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,590
Is it halloween?

552
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,400
I didn't realize.

553
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,330
Morgan,hey.

554
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,210
You up for a little mystery crisper holiday edition?

555
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,570
I'm sure i have no idea what you're talking about,lester.

556
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,020
Jeffrey.

557
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,050
Hey,morgan,buddy,where were you this morning?

558
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,280
I thought you wanted a ride in.

559
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,210
Why are you all dressed up?

560
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,640
Why are you all dressed up?

561
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,560
I have a job interview today.

562
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,980
Bully for you,chuck.
What?

563
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,170
You think you're the only one at the
buy more who cares about looking professional?

564
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,210
Typical.

565
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,530
I never,i never said anything...

566
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,650
Boo!
Aah!

567
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,310
Did i scare you,chuck?

568
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,400
You better be scared,'cause i'm about
ready to kill me a job interview,partner.

569
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,400
Ka-pow!

570
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,830
Lazslo is not headed east.

571
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,210
He's going to the santa monica pier.

572
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,410
Yeah,you don't say?

573
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,420
We just found the gps in downtown.

574
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,630
Lazslo ripped it out and stuck it under a big rig.

575
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,090
Look,he was casing the arcade.

576
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,440
It's where he was first recruited.

577
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,180
There's a huge halloween party there every year.

578
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,940
I think he's going to blow it up.

579
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,480
Where do you think you're going?

580
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,210
Um...It's you.

581
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,910
Hey,hey,big mike,i...

582
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,520
Can i...Can i borrow another herder?

583
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,210
All the herders are out.

584
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,220
You've got an interview this afternoon,or did you forget?
No.

585
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,450
I-i just...I'm...

586
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,510
Something came up.

587
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,590
Is that something more important
than being assistant manager?

588
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,340
Is it more important than
handing over your promotion to tang?

589
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,010
Please,chuck.Is it more important
than big mike's relaxation?

590
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,340
Look,big mike,there are just some things
in life that are more important than the buy more.

591
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,460
You mean,like fishing and danish?

592
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,550
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

593
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,320
**

594
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,330
Bartowski?

595
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,170
Excuse me,you-you in the gordon gecko costume.

596
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,990
Have you seen chuck bartowski?

597
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,110
It's time for his interview.

598
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,820
I actually don't know where chuck's
been keeping himself these days.

599
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,340
So-sorry.

600
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,050
I guess your boyfriend just couldn't take the heat,huh?

601
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,690
I'm sure he's got a perfectly good excuse.

602
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,650
Sure he does.

603
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,370
First chuck bails on you and
your stupid space-penis costume.

604
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,770
And then,he doesn't even have
the stones to show up for his interview.

605
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,650
What a loser.

606
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,510
Even by your standards.

607
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:45,350
If i were you,i'd start interviewing
for a new best friend,ma-ma-ma...

608
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,530
Morgan.

609
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,810
Let me ask you something.

610
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,120
What do you know about chuck bartowski?

611
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,730
You're not bartowski.

612
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,440
Actually,i'm-i'm here to interview on my friend's behalf.

613
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,050
Look...

614
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,590
Please,please,just hear me out,okay?

615
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,220
I know that the virtues that make for
a good buy more manager are the same virtues

616
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,610
that make for a best friend.

617
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,900
Now,uh,chuck and i may have our differences,
but i can tell yo5 this about him.

618
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,920
Chuck is-is brave.

619
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,900
Chuck is loyal.

620
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,300
You know,chuck can quote wrath of khan word-for-word.

621
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,870
And chuck is courageous.

622
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,770
Chuck's got a wicked vinyl collection,
and chuck has the wisdom to not eat garbage

623
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,380
from the break room Crisper.

624
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,520
If you want my open and honest and direct opinion,
the best man for this job

625
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,590
is a man by the name of chuck Bartowski.

626
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,930
Some speech.

627
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,900
Chuck bartowski sounds like a hell of a guy.

628
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,730
He is.

629
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,730
When he comes in tomorrow,
he'll be working for one...

630
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,710
Harold tiberius tang.

631
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,370
God help you all.

632
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,570
i meant to tell you earlier about
your car's self-destruct function.

633
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,760
One of my more inspired designs.

634
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,130
Lazslo,listen.

635
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,210
Relax,chuck.

636
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,450
She's all yours.

637
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,240
What did you just do?

638
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,820
You just armed a bomb.

639
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,880
That would have taken me hours to
get through the fingerprint recognition system.

640
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,420
Why are you doing this?
What?

641
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,200
Blowing stuff up?

642
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,830
That's what bad guys do,chuck.

643
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,090
Besides,how else was i going to punish
them for what they did to me?

644
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,440
Yeah?
Hey,someone just armed the herder to sedf-destruct.

645
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,300
Yeah.I know.

646
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,710
It was me.

647
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,630
Disarm the bomb right now!

648
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,310
You disarm the bomb!

649
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,420
How?

650
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,670
Cut the wire.

651
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,030
which one?
The red one.

652
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,110
You got to cut a wire,chuck!

653
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,560
What if i cut both of them?

654
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,190
Oh,like sean connery in the end of goldfinger?

655
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,110
What did you just say?

656
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,120
Cut the wire,chuck.

657
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,590
The other night,you said
you'd never seen goldfinger,so,

658
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,210
how would you know what bond
does at the end of The movie?

659
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,240
Cut the wire,or we're dead.

660
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
You lied to me,lazslo.

661
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,380
You knew i'd believe you when
you said you just wanted to live a normal,peaceful life.

662
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,570
And you knew that i'd believe you about
cudting the wire,but you were wrong,lazslo.

663
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,110
Chuck!
Wait!Wait!Stay back!

664
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,410
Cut the red wire,chuck!

665
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,350
you're under arrest.

666
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,950
Come on.

667
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,860
i liked it a little bit,all right?

668
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,510
All right,now,how do i...

669
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,800
hey,chuck.

670
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,280
Nice costume,chuck.

671
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,370
And what are you supposed to be?

672
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,350
Oh,that's right.

673
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,480
You're my employee.

674
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,550
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

675
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,390
You did hear i got the job.

676
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,370
Uncontested.
Yeah.

677
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,580
Nice work,harry.

678
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:32,420
Anyhow,now that you're here,
i wanted to talk to you about some organizational ideas

679
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,180
i had for the nerd Herd...

680
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,480
Chuck,where are you going?

681
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,150
Chuck?

682
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,650
Chuck,i will not be ignored!

683
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,000
Did morgan ever find you?

684
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,690
I thought the guy was going to lose it.

685
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,430
No.I-i know.

686
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,670
He was really looking forward to
the buy more costume contest.

687
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,800
I'm talking about what he did for you.

688
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,960
Giving the whole big speech to try to
talk the hr guy into giving you the job?

689
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,190
Morgan did that?

690
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,680
And then someone went and stole his bike.

691
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,280
I mean,what kind of loser would steal a guy's bike?

692
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,820
Look at you two.

693
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,200
I didn't think you were coming.

694
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,250
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,470
I got held up.

696
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,740
Listen,morgan,i think you should be the head this year.

697
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,870
Really?

698
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,990
chuck?Chuck,honey?Honey?

699
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,130

703
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,970

704
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,310

and chuck really came through.

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,000
He probably wouldn't admit it,
but your brother is kind of a hero.

708
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,650

Sarah was just telling me that if she were
stranded on a desert island,she would bring roast beef.

729
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,750
She didn't say roast beef.

730
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,650
Oh,she totally...

731
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,860
she completely said roast beef.
oh,that's terrible.

732
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,300
Oh,that's a terrible sandwich,
it's a terrible sandwich.

733
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,960
You know,she's smart,and she's sexy,
and kudos on her costume,looked fantastic,

734
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,840
but who brings roast beef To a deserted island?

735
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,530
That's a terrible choice.
