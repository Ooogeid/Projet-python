1
00:00:01,198 --> 00:00:03,866
Kind of a crazy night.

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:05,868
One more patient, and I am on my way.

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,420
So, what seems to be the problem?

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,142
(muffled breathing)

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,511
<i>Woman: Well, let's have
a look at you.</i>

6
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:19,298
Where am I?

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,717
Who are you?

8
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:23,152
My name is sydney.

9
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,820
And...

10
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:27,823
(grunts)

11
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:29,692
(horns honking)

12
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:34,029
Here's where you are.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,969
Now... I trust we're feeling all right?

14
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:41,770
Not too many bumps and bruises?

15
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:43,505
After all, we're going to need you

16
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:44,907
In tip-top shape.

17
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,592
Need me for what?

18
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:47,877
Nothing too difficult.

19
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,613
At least not for one of the cia's best.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,715
No, no, no, you got me
mixed up with someone else.

21
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:53,949
I'm just a doctor.

22
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:56,251
We know exactly who you are, devon.

23
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:58,304
(sighs)

24
00:00:58,388 --> 00:00:59,939
So, please,

25
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:02,308
Tell me...

26
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:08,113
...What's it like being a world-class spy?

27
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:09,431
(car horn honking)

28
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:10,900
Chuck, stop freaking out.

29
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,151
Oh, I'm not freaking out.

30
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:13,802
I'll tell you why I'm not freaking out.

31
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,454
That would require me overreacting,

32
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:16,956
And I don't think it's technically possible

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,291
For me to overreact to my brothe
r-in-law being kidnapped!

34
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:20,743
We're doing the best we can, chuck.

35
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,378
Why don't you go upstairs, go to work.

36
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:25,214
We'll call you as soon as we have any news.

37
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:26,815
Chuck: Look at that-- ellie is making

38
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:28,450
Her 50th call to awesome within the hour,

39
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,386
In addition to the 20 that she's

40
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:31,520
Made to me already today.

41
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:32,554
She's-she's losing it.

42
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,456
What-what am I supposed to tell her?

43
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:36,592
Honestly, chuck,
I think the best thing you can do

44
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:38,126
Is to just calm down.

45
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,228
Here's a little tip: If you really

46
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:40,229
Want someone to calm down,

47
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:41,730
Never tell them to calm down,

48
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,499
Because it doesn't work!
They don't calm down!

49
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

50
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:46,485
I'm sorry. I'm calming down.

51
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:48,837
Here comes the calm.

52
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,305
I will soon...

53
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:52,491
Be calm.

54
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,142
Not working. I'm not calming down.

55
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,778
I tell you what-- I got an idea.

56
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,012
I'm going to go to work,

57
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,364
And then you guys call me

58
00:01:58,448 --> 00:01:59,648
<i>The absolute second that you hear</i>

59
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,984
<i>Anything about devon.</i>

60
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,003
(sighs)

61
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,323
<i>Big mike: Calm down, morgan.</i>

62
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,857
You got nothing to worry about, son.

63
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,360
So, you can wipe that
concerned look off that...

64
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:12,861
Hairy face.

65
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,430
Yeah, well, it's just...
It's a little unusual

66
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:15,631
That you would call me in

67
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,433
Before I even have time
to screw anything up.

68
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,434
You're right.

69
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,369
Usually, mornings are big mike time.

70
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:22,504
Time for reflection and-and pastry.

71
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,273
But I'll tell you something, son.

72
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,941
You've become like family to me.

73
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,876
Oh. Thank you, sir. No.

74
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:29,378
Thank your mama.

75
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:32,281
Woman makes me feel good.

76
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,682
Real good.

77
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,050
Like a man should.

78
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,286
But credit where it's due.

79
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:39,021
I've noticed a change in you lately.

80
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,407
You're commanding more
respect from your coworkers.

81
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,625
You're walking a little taller around here.

82
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:45,294
Seems to me...

83
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:47,129
You're ready to run with the big dogs.

84
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:48,363
Of course.

85
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,065
Wait, what?

86
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,200
Morgan, are you ready to
be my assistant manager?

87
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,635
Me, sir?

88
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:54,937
I believe in you, son.

89
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:58,774
Well?

90
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,509
Yes.

91
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:06,882
Yeah, this will be good.

92
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,484
One of the big dogs.

93
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:09,651
(barks)

94
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,387
No. Don't do that.

95
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,223
That's a little dog-
schnauzer or something.

96
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,407
(deep bark) big dog.

97
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:16,558
<i>Chuck: Hey, sarah-- chuck.</i>

98
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:17,776
I had an idea-- delta force.

99
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,994
Have you called them yet?

100
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,496
If not, call me back
with their number, okay?

101
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:21,580
Lester: Ah. Just in time.

102
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:22,898
Need that big brain of yours, charles.

103
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,266
Jeff is dead wrong about something.

104
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:26,234
Well, that's kind of his
default setting, is it not?

105
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,252
Woman: Excuse me, sir.

106
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:28,620
Can you help me?

107
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:31,290
I understand you're having
a big sale on hdtvs.

108
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:32,407
Uh, yes, we are.

109
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,376
Lester or jeff here could actually...

110
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:37,379
Sarah.

111
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,430
(sighs)

112
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:39,581
Seriously, charles,

113
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:40,799
It's an emergency here.

114
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:43,102
Woman: Young man, you even listening?

115
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:44,186
(speaking thai)

116
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:52,444
(speaking thai)

117
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,820
(whimpers) (sighs)

118
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,323
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

119
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,041
I went... That's not what I meant to say.

120
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,209
(sighs)

121
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:08,577
Impressive.

122
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:09,828
Now, if jean-claude van damme

123
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:11,279
And steven seagal got into a fight,

124
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:12,498
Who do you think would win?

125
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:13,632
This is your big question?

126
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:15,450
Bear in mind that master seagal's

127
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,169
Fighting style choice is aikido-- like so...

128
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:18,286
"I'm just a cook.

129
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:19,888
I'm a lowly cook."

130
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,723
Come on, buddy!

131
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,559
<i>Lester: Come on, buddy. Come on.</i>

132
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:24,560
I'm not going to hurt you.

133
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:25,928
What you got? What you got?

134
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,933
Boom, boom, pow!

135
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,901
Okay. I think he'll live,

136
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,436
But we need to get you out of here.

137
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,071
Listen, we think we know who has awesome.

138
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,940
The last patient that he saw at the hospital

139
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,158
Was a ring operative.

140
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,475
What? What, sarah?

141
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:41,610
The ring? Oh, my god.

142
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,811
This is all my fault.

143
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,646
I'm the one who got him
involved in all this.

144
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:46,248
They're probably torturing him as we speak.

145
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:47,916
No, there is no reason to think that.
Yeah, you're right.

146
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:49,351
There are hundreds of
other nightmare scenarios

147
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,003
Far worse. Uh, chuck...

148
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,204
No, don't you understand?

149
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,205
I'm responsible for this.

150
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,090
I killed captain awesome.

151
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:56,675
Oh, my god.

152
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,826
You're back.

153
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:59,161
Thank god.

154
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,662
Oh, my god, you're back. You're back.

155
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:02,264
This is... This is great news.

156
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:03,699
This is very good news. Are you okay?

157
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,267
Tell me you're okay.

158
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,569
Chuck, they think I'm a spy.

159
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:10,556
I'm in trouble here, man.

160
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,057
They think I'm you.

(whimpers)

170
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,623
From what he has told us,
we can conclude that the woman

171
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:59,541
Devon was with is sydney prince,

172
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,676
The head of a ring cell in los angeles.

173
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,146
She has tried to recruit
several of our agents.

174
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:05,330
She knows everything about me, chuck.

175
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,115
Ellie, too.

176
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:10,018
Everything except who the
real spy in the family is.

177
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,436
That's an understandable mistake.

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,221
One of them looks like a spy,

179
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,156
And the other one looks... Like chuck.

180
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:16,808
True. She gave me this.

181
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:19,127
She told me she'd contact
me with instructions.

182
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:20,662
It's a ring communication device, general.

183
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,630
Exactly. It works off a closed network,

184
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,699
But the nsa has recently developed

185
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,267
New technology to crack it.

186
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,869
Now we can put it into use.

187
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:28,987
All right. Fantastic news.

188
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:30,038
Sounds like a plan.

189
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:31,156
I'm going to get awesome back

190
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
To my sister before she has an aneurysm.

191
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,709
You can't take him home quite yet, chuck.

192
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,995
We still need to talk about
how we're going to use devon.

193
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,329
Excuse me-- what? Oh, no, no.

194
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,631
No one's using devon.

195
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:42,484
There will be no using of him anymore.

196
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,669
Okay, no more fun spy
games for him, forever.

197
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:46,721
Using devon is our best option.

198
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:50,358
Sydney won't go to her
superiors with his identity

199
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,476
Until she definitively knows

200
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,161
Whether she has turned him or burned him.

201
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,496
When sydney contacts him,

202
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:56,398
He'll do what she says
just long enough for us

203
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:57,866
To track her, find her and bring her in.

204
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,334
You mean I have to do what she says?

205
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,735
No, you don't. No, he doesn't.

206
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:03,204
This is my family we're talking about here.

207
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,607
Come on. It's the only way to keep him safe.

208
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,411
Devon, we'll be with you
every step of the way.

209
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,781
If you tell me you can get
me through this, I trust you.

210
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,119
I will, devon.

211
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,856
I promise.

212
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,425
<i>Morgan: Um, excuse me.</i>

213
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:24,526
Stop right there.

214
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:26,344
Are you leaving early again, bartowski?

215
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:27,762
Are you serious?

216
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,597
No, of course not, man. I'm kidding.

217
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,032
No, I mean, are you being serious?

218
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,667
Are you seriously wearing
that vest right now?

219
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,935
Ah.

220
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:36,604
Big mike made me...

221
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:37,872
Assistant manager.

222
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,057
And I accepted it.

223
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,725
Boom.

224
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,943
Well, congratulations, buddy.

225
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,061
I'm proud of you.

226
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,612
Lester: Charles.

227
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Oh!

228
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,198
Oh, wow.

229
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,900
Lester, I'm really sorry

230
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:50,285
About the...

231
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,220
That was a completely kne
e-jerk reaction. You know what?

232
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,072
I'm just going to switch
to decaf from now on.

233
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,089
It's not a problem.

234
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:56,891
In fact, I want to thank you.

235
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,877
You helped me feel something

236
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,879
I have not felt in a long time.

237
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,597
Another human's foot on your body?

238
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:05,032
The thrill of being alive.

239
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,751
What? The electrifying sensation

240
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,570
Of pain coursing through my face

241
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:11,306
Was like an adrenaline shot to my soul.

242
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,541
It made me feel like a man,

243
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:15,276
Maybe for the first time
since my bar mitzvah.

244
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,578
I've never had a bar mitzvah.

245
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:17,979
Chuck, please.

246
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,047
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

247
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
Chuck: I... I think

248
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,019
That you two are certifiably disturbed.

249
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,187
I'm going to go home.

250
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,405
So... Hey.

251
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,656
Uh, you want a ride home?

252
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,725
Yeah, I got access to the company car.

253
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,277
Oh, big man on campus. All right.

254
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,912
Well, actually, uh,
awesome's at the mall today,

255
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:35,780
And we got to talk about a few things,

256
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,031
So I'll see you at home.

257
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:38,950
Oh. All right.

258
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,253
Chuck: You okay, man?

259
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:43,705
Captain: No, no, it's ellie.

260
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,923
God, chuck.

261
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,208
What am I going to tell
her about where I've been?

262
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,676
I'm a terrible liar, man.

263
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:49,677
(door opening)

264
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,112
Devon, is that you?

265
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,714
(whispering): Remember to keep it simple.

266
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,132
Simple.

267
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,266
Oh, thank god.

268
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,218
I was so worried.

269
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,971
Yeah, babe, I'm... I'm fine.

270
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,189
Why didn't you call?

271
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,974
Um, uh...

272
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:05,226
After I got off the overnight,

273
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:08,363
I decided I needed to clear my head.

274
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,282
So, I went for a run...

275
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,818
In griffith park.

276
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:15,904
No cell phones there.

277
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,789
Uh-uh. So, I'm running,

278
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,340
And I just... I heard something

279
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:20,708
In a tree.

280
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:21,876
It was a...

281
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,128
It's a cat.

282
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,847
A hurt cat.

283
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,749
I had to see if it needed medical attention.

284
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,084
Then, I realized...

285
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:36,925
It's a bear.

286
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,893
What's a bear? The cat's a bear?

287
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,311
Yeah, yeah, the cat's a bear.

288
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,813
It's a... It's a bear, and it...

289
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,097
Jumps out at me,

290
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:44,265
And it attacks, and it's like...

291
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,767
It's angry at me

292
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,852
For some reason, this bear. (roars)

293
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:48,903
Oh, my god!

294
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:50,488
You were attacked by a bear?

295
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,690
Yeah, and I... I...

296
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,075
Cut off its head.

297
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:58,947
Yeah, babe, I... I decapitated the bear.

298
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,250
In self-defense, in order to survive.

299
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:04,285
I'm just glad you weren't there to see it.

300
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:05,553
It was really grisly.

301
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:10,174
Do you honestly expect me to believe this?

302
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:12,377
Because you two think I'm an idiot.

303
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:13,628
Is that what you think?

304
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,629
No, no, no.

305
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,847
That is not what we think.

306
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,715
That is not what we think.

307
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,353
I think that it's time that
we tell ellie the truth.

308
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:23,972
Oh, yeah. Thank god, chuck.

309
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,473
The truth.

310
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,275
I'm terrible at this.
I'm a terrible liar, honey.

311
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:28,743
You know that.

312
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,211
Clearly.

313
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,113
Casey was arrested

314
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,881
Early this morning in griffith park.

315
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,650
He was drunk, super drunk.

316
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,701
Really blotto.

317
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,086
Cop's words, not mine.

318
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:39,754
He was in bad shape, wasn't he, devon?

319
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,406
Yeah.

320
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:43,491
Yeah, it was bad, hon.

321
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,411
He wet himself.

322
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:47,996
Also exposed himself.

323
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,999
Anyhow, devon... Spent most of the day,

324
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,334
Pretty much all day down at the station

325
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,036
Talking to a buddy of his on the force

326
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,604
Trying to get the charges dropped, so...

327
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:57,755
Oh, my god.

328
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,806
Really?

329
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:00,842
Really. Really.

330
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,343
(door closes)

331
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,978
Hey, guys.

332
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,480
Ugh.

333
00:11:08,183 --> 00:11:10,518
Uh, let's go inside, devon.

334
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,438
(door opens then closes)

335
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,523
What?

336
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,693
Nothing.

337
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,295
(grunts)

338
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,378
(clears throat)

339
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:40,798
Jeff?

340
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:41,849
You got a second?

341
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,551
What's going on here, man?

342
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,970
I noticed everybody's a little beat up.

343
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:46,938
The first rule of fight...

344
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,556
Easy.

345
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,108
Our friend, morgan, here is

346
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,693
The assistant manager now.

347
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,860
Oh, guys.

348
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,529
We've worked together for a long time.

349
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,447
You know, we're... We're chums.

350
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:57,699
Whatever you say.

351
00:11:58,784 --> 00:11:59,901
Ass man.

352
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,620
Don't you mean, mr. Ass man?

353
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,822
I do not.

354
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,214
<i>Chuck: I can't believe the ring
thinks awesome's a spy.</i>

355
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,133
This is crazy. This-this is crazy.

356
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,551
When do you think she's gonna call?

357
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:17,802
What do you think she's gonna say?

358
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,887
What do you think we do when she does call?

359
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:21,389
Chuck, the important thing is

360
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,391
That devon will be looking
to you as his handler.

361
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,059
And you need to remember what it felt like

362
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,061
To be scared and new to this.

363
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,896
Yeah, like he'll ever forget that.

364
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,565
Think of it this way: On this mission,

365
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:31,799
Devon is you and you're her.

366
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,135
So, be her, chuck, huh?

367
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,637
Well, maybe sydney will never call?

368
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:37,989
(knocking on door) captain: Guys.

369
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:39,157
Guys, it's me.

370
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,358
You in there?

371
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:41,659
She called.

372
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:42,777
What's that?

373
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,778
Found it on my front step.

374
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:44,779
It's from sydney.

375
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,280
I gotta open it right away.

376
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,616
She's gonna call in about
five minutes. Come on.

377
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,374
What do you think is in there?

378
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,928
(beeping)

379
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,550
It's okay, answer it.

380
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:08,669
Hello?

381
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,305
From now on, devon,

382
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,024
I will speak to you through the earpiece

383
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,342
Included in the package.

384
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,978
And you will speak to me
through the watch we sent.

385
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,180
Now, put in the earpiece,
and put on the watch.

386
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:22,733
(whispering): Par for the course.

387
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,285
Just do what she says.

388
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,738
Okay, putting on the earpiece now. (beeps)

389
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:31,659
Now we can track you on our own gps network.

390
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,544
It's fine.

391
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,596
Standard operating procedure.

392
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:38,082
Be at the crystal towers
downtown in one hour.

393
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,767
Come alone.

394
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:43,671
Oh, and, devon, the earpiece
is also an explosive device.

395
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,240
Remove it, or deviate from
my instructions in any way,

396
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,976
And I will detonate it,

397
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:52,880
Ruining that lovely face of yours.

398
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:56,150
Sarah: No.

399
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,520
Okay, well, that is not standard... At all.

400
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:07,634
<i>Captain: Chuck?</i>

401
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:09,403
Chuck, it's me. Can you hear me?

402
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:11,672
Yes, yes, buddy, yes. I'm-I'm right here.

403
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:13,907
And you're sure they can't
hear me talking to you?

404
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,743
They can only hear you if you
press the button on their watch.

405
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,079
An open bug would be far too easy to trace.

406
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:21,999
I've labeled the watches
so you don't get confused.

407
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,700
Sarah: Devon, this is sarah.

408
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:24,985
As soon as sydney calls,

409
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,520
Casey's going to start tracking the signal.

410
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:27,955
As soon as we've tracked her location,

411
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,990
We're going to bring her
in and then you're done.

412
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:31,658
Whew.

413
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:32,676
Okay, good.

414
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,128
Chuck, this gonna work, right, buddy?

415
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,328
Remember,

416
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,047
If you freak out, he's going to freak out.

417
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:40,000
This is absolutely going to work.

418
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,219
Everything is fine.

419
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,938
I am very confident.

420
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,190
(beeping) sydney: Devon?

421
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:47,441
Are you ready to begin?

422
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:52,863
Ready.

423
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:54,231
There is a penthouse on the 12th floor.

424
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:55,365
Go there.

425
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,617
The building has extensive security,

426
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:58,585
But it's nothing that you can't handle.

427
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:00,787
We'll talk again once you're there.

428
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,789
She's close.

429
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:05,042
Wasn't on the line long enough
to get an exact location.

430
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:06,360
Need another call. Another call?!

431
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,794
No, we can't wait.

432
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:09,796
The guy's got an explosive
earpiece stuck in his head!

433
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,364
Chuck, our target is sydney.

434
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,200
We need to get her to save him.

435
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,701
Okay, fine, then you get her,

436
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,203
And I'll get awesome up to the 12th floor.

437
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:18,138
Buddy, head inside the building and wait.

438
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:19,806
Wait? Wait for what?

439
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:21,275
(grunts)

440
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:24,561
Wait for me.

441
00:15:28,716 --> 00:15:31,068
Good luck.

442
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:36,323
Chuck?

443
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,557
Chuck, where are you?

444
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,742
I'm on my way, buddy.

445
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,947
Here to see someone in the building?

446
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:50,204
(panting): Well...

447
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:51,238
Yeah.

448
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,440
Yeah, kinda.

449
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:55,876
I'm here to meet... Meet my friend.

450
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,277
Chuck.

451
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,517
Does this chuck work here?

452
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,469
He could work here.

453
00:16:05,553 --> 00:16:07,137
He might. Okay, pal.

454
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:08,689
Take it easy.

455
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:09,973
I'm building security.

456
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:13,026
My name's julius.

457
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:14,228
What's the problem?

458
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:18,148
You can tell me.

459
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,600
(sighs)

460
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,636
I'm involved in something
really messed up, man.

461
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:24,154
Been lying to my wife.

462
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,639
Been lying to everybody.

463
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:28,442
I can't take it anymore.

464
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,294
Because of this chuck guy?

465
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,045
Yeah. Yeah, chuck.

466
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:34,648
I think I understand.

467
00:16:34,716 --> 00:16:36,216
Look, pal,

468
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,252
If you really love this chuck,

469
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:39,286
You have to tell your wife.

470
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,138
You can't live a lie.

471
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:44,141
Trust me, I've been there.

472
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,226
That's not really what I mean.

473
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,394
Sure, it isn't.

474
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:48,428
(silenced gunshots) (groans)

475
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,346
Oh!

476
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:52,349
Chuck!

477
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,567
You killed julius!

478
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,402
What? Kill?! I would never do that.

479
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:56,853
It's a tranq gun. (gun firing, groans)

480
00:16:58,156 --> 00:16:59,773
That's preposterous.

481
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:01,742
Killing someone.

482
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,361
Come on. Bingo.

483
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:05,612
All right,

484
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,080
He's going to be fine. Come on.

485
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:09,166
¶ ¶

486
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:18,091
So, what do you think is up there?

487
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,426
Something pretty gnarly, huh?

488
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:20,761
It's best not to speculate.

489
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:22,429
I mean, nine times out of ten--

490
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:23,663
Well, seven--

491
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,849
You get yourself all worked up over nothing.

492
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,934
(elevator bell dings)

493
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:32,439
See? Nothing to worry about.

494
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:40,564
Man: Hey, you're not allowed up here!

495
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,488
(silenced gunshots)

496
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:49,489
(heavy breathing)

497
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,824
Look out.

498
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:58,715
Dude, you're incredible!

499
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,267
Was that your spy training?

500
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:02,336
Duck hunt. Nintendo.

501
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,755
(beeping)

502
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:06,757
Devon?

503
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:07,808
Yes, sydney.

504
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,509
Good, you're alive.

505
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:12,262
Down the hall to your
left is an unmarked door.

506
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:14,264
The lock works via retina scan.

507
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,732
Cut out one of the guards' eyes

508
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:17,918
And use it to open the door.

509
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:19,936
What?

510
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:21,988
We got to cut out one of these
guys' eyes for the scan!

511
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,573
I took an oath, bro.

512
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:25,125
I can't cut out a man's eye.

513
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:27,327
I got a better idea.

514
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:28,745
Captain (strains): Jeez, this guy's heavy.

515
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,197
Yeah.

516
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,466
Well, bad guys don't count carbs, buddy.

517
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:35,502
(mechanical whirring)

518
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:38,004
(sighs)

519
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:40,073
(heavy breathing)

520
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,644
Sarah, we have reached the 12th floor,

521
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:46,012
But what the heck is going on?

522
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,014
This is a cia facility.

523
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:50,016
Sarah? Hello?

524
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:51,451
Chuck? Hello?

525
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,686
I lost him.

526
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:53,920
(beeping)

527
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:55,755
Tracked her. She's...

528
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:58,475
She's right here.

529
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:02,229
Sarah: That's her.

530
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,730
(doors, windows clicking) let's go!

531
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:05,565
What the hell?!

532
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,152
Casey, walker. Stand down.

533
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,320
General, we have a visual on sydney.

534
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:11,571
She just walked past us.

535
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:14,374
<i>She's heading inside the building.</i>

536
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,131
I've just received new
mission information, colonel.

537
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,183
Your new directive is to stand down.

538
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,617
General, chuck has reached the 12th floor,

539
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:26,386
And he says it's some kind of cia base.

540
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:28,138
If that's true, then this
is some kind of a setup.

541
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:32,092
Yes, that's exactly what this is.

542
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,730
Excellent work, devon.

543
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:38,064
You're almost finished.

544
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,517
There's a man in the office
at the end of the hall.

545
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,152
Chuck, sydney says there's
a man in the office

546
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:43,186
At the end of the hall.

547
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,071
Find him.

548
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:47,107
And kill him.

549
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:50,177
Chuck, she wants us to
find him and kill him.

550
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:52,746
Nobody's going to kill anybody, okay?

551
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:56,283
Just calm down and stay close.

552
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,676
Excuse me, sir?

553
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:08,762
Excuse me, I know this is a little awkward,

554
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:09,996
But don't move.

555
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,998
But also don't be afraid.

556
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,350
My name is... Chuck.

557
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:16,002
Chuck bartowski.

558
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:18,004
I know.

559
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:19,723
How... How do you... How do you know that?

560
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:23,027
I know things, lots of things,
about you, about them.

561
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:24,228
What-what do you know about the ring?

562
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:25,145
What are they doing here? What do they want?

563
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,179
Why do they need devon?

564
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,180
They don't need anything.

565
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,181
They already have everything.

566
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,233
Simple as that.

567
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,651
Now, sydney will be here any minute.

568
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:31,685
We've got to do this.

569
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:32,853
Syd-sydney's coming here?

570
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,204
You know she wants me to kill you, right?

571
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:35,372
But don't worry, I'm-I'm not gonna do that.

572
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,541
However, we do need a plan. I've got one.

573
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,361
You're going to kill me, chuck.

574
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:43,030
What? No.

575
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:44,898
No, no, no, no. I don't kill people.

576
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,584
Okay? I have rules against such things.

577
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:49,136
Shoot me. Here.

578
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:50,537
Try to be precise.

579
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:51,972
Are you listening to anything
I'm saying right now?

580
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,090
I don't kill people.

581
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:54,374
Therefore, I don't shoot them.

582
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,876
Maybe with a tranq gun.
I'll tranq anybody you want.

583
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,428
But a gun-gun. I hate gun-guns.

584
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:00,397
Listen, if you don't kill me now,

585
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:01,765
You and devon are as good as dead.

586
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,733
Well, I'm not gonna do it!

587
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,435
Chuck.

588
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,053
I have to die. Now.

589
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:07,220
The ring knows too much.

590
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:08,822
There's no other way.

591
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,390
So, just do it.

592
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:11,408
Shoot me.

593
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:13,193
(heavy breathing)

594
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,783
I-I-I can't do it.

595
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,251
I can't do it.

596
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:23,754
Afterward, put the gun in
devon's hands, then hide.

597
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:26,440
When she's leaves, open this.

598
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:35,432
Truth is, I hate guns, too.

599
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:37,935
Who are you?

600
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:41,939
(gasps, body thuds)

601
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,458
Chuck!

602
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:46,226
Huh? What?

603
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:47,728
What, no, I didn't-- no!

604
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,646
That's not me, I didn't shoot him, I swear!

605
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:55,268
He's dead.

606
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,288
Chuck, this is not a tranq gun.

607
00:21:58,373 --> 00:22:00,441
(door opening)

608
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:03,327
(footsteps approaching)

609
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:04,711
Okay, listen to me.

610
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,296
<i>Remember, you shot him.</i>

611
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:33,023
Gun?

612
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:38,412
Take off the watch.

613
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,327
Well done.

614
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:57,047
<i>Cute and talented.</i>

615
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:58,899
(beeps)

616
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,517
What a catch.

617
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:03,887
(sighs)

618
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:07,191
Lose the body, keep the phone.

619
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:08,692
We'll be in touch.

620
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:11,228
Welcome to the ring.

621
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:16,733
(exhaling loudly)

622
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:19,486
Chuck, chuck, what the
hell is going on right now?

623
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:27,794
"med kit in desk. The pill was amiodarone.

624
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,196
Save me"?

625
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,363
Amiodarone.

626
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:32,549
Amiodarone stops your heart,

627
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:34,168
Only momentarily though.

628
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:36,170
If it's a clean shot I think I can save him.

629
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:39,139
Here.

630
00:23:46,314 --> 00:23:47,564
(gasping)

631
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:53,487
(groaning)

632
00:23:57,108 --> 00:24:00,327
To answer your question,

633
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:01,862
My name is shaw.

634
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,250
I would like to introduce you all

635
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,353
To cia special agent daniel shaw.

636
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,989
For the last five years,
he has worked on nothing

637
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:17,557
But taking out the ring.

638
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:20,226
From this point on, agent shaw
has total command authority

639
00:24:20,277 --> 00:24:23,396
On any mission having
anything to do with the ring.

640
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:25,482
Really? This guy? I have back issues

641
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,500
<i>Of guns & ammo older than he is.</i>

642
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,903
Be that as it may, you should all know

643
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:32,372
That I've been fully briefed on
the details of the intersect.

644
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,243
That's right. I know everything.

645
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:41,714
Thank you very much, general.

646
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,049
I'll take it from here.

647
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:45,885
Colonel, walker, chuck,
you're in good hands.

648
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,221
Good luck.

649
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,924
Here's an overview of current ring intel.

650
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,291
Great, welcome to the team.

651
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:53,643
But sydney is still out there,

652
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:55,127
Which means my brothe
r-in-law's still in danger.

653
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:56,229
Not for long.

654
00:24:56,296 --> 00:24:57,564
As you've seen, the ring operates

655
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:59,499
Through a network of decentralized cells.

656
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,234
If we catch sydney, there's a good chance

657
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:02,902
We can contain devon's identity.

658
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,605
He's a bona fide mole in their operation.

659
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:08,658
In order to save him, we have to use him.

660
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,276
What? No! No way!

661
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,377
I've already been over this.

662
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:12,862
Devon is out of the spy business

663
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,113
For good. Chuck,

664
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:15,331
As long as sydney is alive,

665
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:16,449
Devon is a marked man.

666
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,450
She's right, chuck.

667
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,868
Casey, sarah, please!

668
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:20,286
Explain the risks to him.

669
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:22,705
The risks are greater for
devon if we don't use him.

670
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,057
Sydney would sooner kill him

671
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:25,959
Than let him go. Well, I don't care.

672
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,126
He's not a spy.

673
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:31,097
Well, chuck, then I guess the question is:

674
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:32,665
Do you have a better plan?

675
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:46,479
<i>Morgan: Where in the
hell is everyone?</i>

676
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:52,619
(distant cheering and shouting)

677
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,954
What is that?

678
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:58,374
¶ ¶

679
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,694
(grunting and cheering)

680
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,216
A fight club?

681
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,967
No, no!

682
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:10,202
No! We cannot have this, guys!

683
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:12,505
Come on, there's, you know,
insurance issues.

684
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,975
(crowd booing)

685
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,481
Who's next?!

686
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:24,684
Who wants to regain their manhood?

687
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:25,902
Lester, come on, man,

688
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:27,487
We talked about this.
We can't have this anymore.

689
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:29,072
You have to cut this out!

690
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,240
You can. (crowd cheers)

691
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,059
It's like I'm talking to a wall.

692
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,245
(crowd cheering)

693
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:39,231
Lester, a little help, please.

694
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,500
No, no!

695
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,735
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

696
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:44,403
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

697
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:45,955
Morgan: Don't... (electrical crackling)

698
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,257
Don't... Do not hook that up.

699
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,792
I'm trying to help them.

700
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:52,045
(screaming)

701
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:54,847
Okay, no, no!

702
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,266
Hey, listen to me, back to work!

703
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,417
All right, fight club is over!

704
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:00,303
Lester: Over?

705
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,438
Nothing's over till we say it's over.

706
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:04,757
You may have shut this down,
but you will never

707
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,609
Shut us down.

708
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:10,396
Ass man.

709
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:15,101
(snaps fingers)

710
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:17,487
Yeah. Oh.

711
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,991
(electrical crackling) nice.

712
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:23,876
You could at least unplug the battery!

713
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,628
(knocking) hey.

714
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,613
What's up? Everything okay?

715
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:29,632
Please don't say another mission, chuck.

716
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,450
I can't take this anymore.

717
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:32,669
I'm kind of freaking out.

718
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:33,886
Don't worry, no. No more missions.

719
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:35,755
I'm sorry that I put you through all this

720
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:38,508
But I promised you that I would
take care of it, and I am.

721
00:27:38,592 --> 00:27:40,510
Give me the phone.

722
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:43,896
Thanks.

723
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,497
Morgan: Chuck, you in there?

724
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:02,498
Oh, there you are.

725
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,750
Been looking all over for you.

726
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,585
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

727
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:07,587
'cause I'm in a crisis.

728
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so am I.

729
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,040
Yeah, of course you are.

730
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,208
My man, still working.

731
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,711
An assistant manager's dream.

732
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,629
On to my nightmare.

733
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,831
Uh, lester turned the cage into a fight club

734
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:21,334
And attached a battery to the
fence so he can shock people.

735
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:22,669
(inhales deeply)

736
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:23,836
You smell that?

737
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,638
That's burnt human hair, dude.

738
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,558
I told them to stop and
no one will listen to me.

739
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:30,843
Okay, no one will listen to
anything that I have to say.

740
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:33,396
My job is on the line here.

741
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,199
Yeah, well, it sounds like
you need a plan, buddy.

742
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:38,067
Exactly. That's exactly what I need.

743
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:39,619
Dude, I was thinking, I was, like,

744
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:43,039
You know, I probably need
a plan here but what plan?

745
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:44,574
You know?

746
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:46,692
(beeping)

747
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:51,798
You know-you know sometimes

748
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:54,250
What I like to do is-is,
uh, open up a problem

749
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:55,735
And really examine it.

750
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:57,203
Find its weak points.

751
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:01,507
And then not be afraid to
just attack it head-on.

752
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,710
Wow.

753
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:05,812
Wow.

754
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,013
That's some powerful stuff.

755
00:29:07,064 --> 00:29:08,264
Yeah, I think that'll work.

756
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:10,716
Thanks, man. Yeah, buddy.

757
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:20,359
(beeping)

758
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:22,462
Sydney: How did you activate this phone?

759
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,697
Who is this?

760
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:26,732
I'm the spy who killed agent shaw.

761
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:28,868
This is not devon woodcomb.

762
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,737
Yeah, well, you've been
dealing with the wrong man.

763
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,121
Devon was a decoy.

764
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:34,040
I'm the one who put that bullet

765
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:36,592
Through agent shaw's chest last night.

766
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:38,577
I'm the spy that you're looking for.

767
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:40,963
And I am in charge of this mission now.

768
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:48,859
Hey, hey, sarah, uh, it's chuck.

769
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,729
Don't be mad at me, but I may
or may not have called sydney

770
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:54,031
On the ringphone so she would
track me here to the buy more.

771
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:55,232
It's a trap, my trap.

772
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:57,001
You told sydney to go to the buy more?

773
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:01,605
Oh, my god, it worked. They're here.

774
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:02,956
Okay, grab casey

775
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,708
And get up here so we can take them out.

776
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,110
No, chuck, what are you, crazy?

777
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:09,213
Not very smart, chuck.

778
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:11,248
This is not how I do business.

779
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:13,083
You start things on your own,

780
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:14,952
You better be prepared to finish them...

781
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,487
On your own.

782
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:18,555
Good luck.

783
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:21,591
He hung up on me.

784
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:22,776
Casey: What are you doing?

785
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:24,261
Without us, he doesn't have a chance.

786
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:25,646
He's gonna start to panic

787
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,264
And then he's not gonna be
able to perform properly.

788
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:28,999
Yeah, happens to lots of guys.

789
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,651
Or so I hear.

790
00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:33,804
Besides, I'm kinda curious
about what his plan is.

791
00:30:33,872 --> 00:30:36,457
Chuck: This isn't part of the plan.

792
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,376
Oh, this is very, very bad.

793
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:54,975
Chuck (over p.A.): Hello, sydney.

794
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,462
Welcome to the burbank buy more.

795
00:30:58,513 --> 00:31:03,133
Please proceed directly
to the home theater room.

796
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:04,134
Find him.

797
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:06,103
I would suggest the best way

798
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:07,654
Of getting to the home theater room

799
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:10,407
Is through the mp3/... Aisle,

800
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:12,309
But beware...

801
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,862
You break it, you buy it.

802
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:19,116
Hello, sir.

803
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,617
Store's closed at the moment

804
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:22,669
But if you want to come back in the morning,

805
00:31:22,754 --> 00:31:24,705
We'll be open around 10:00...

806
00:31:28,126 --> 00:31:29,493
You're signing his death warrant,

807
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:30,677
You know that, don't you?

808
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,729
Ye of little faith.

809
00:31:32,797 --> 00:31:34,014
This is crazy.

810
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm going in. So am I.

811
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:39,186
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you two to stand down.

812
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:41,522
I don't like guns much,

813
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:43,240
But when necessary, I will use them.

814
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,278
Finally, we meet.

815
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:50,013
In an electronics store.

816
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:53,550
Which is different.

817
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:55,519
No matter.

818
00:31:55,587 --> 00:31:58,572
When we last chatted,
you mentioned a certain agent shaw.

819
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,990
That's right.

820
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,858
Because I'm the one who ended shaw's life,

821
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,495
Not devon woodcomb. He was just a patsy.

822
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:06,914
<i>You took out shaw?</i>

823
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,136
Mr. Buy more?

824
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:13,670
In a nutshell.

825
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,105
I mean, that's kind of what happened.

826
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:16,974
Well, then, if that's true,

827
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,276
You won't have any problem
with glen and ian here.

828
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:21,595
<i>Glen and ian?</i>

829
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,213
Sure.

830
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:25,582
Well, you should know,
glen and ian, ian and glen,

831
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,352
That if you take one more step,
I will drop you.

832
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:33,073
(whispering): Oh, come on, flash. Flash!

833
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:35,943
(chuck groans)

834
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:39,112
(gasps): Okay. Okay, now I'm angry.

835
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:42,332
I'm angry and in a great deal of pain.

836
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,401
(panting)

837
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:47,838
Oh. Oh.

838
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:49,339
Oh...

839
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:54,428
(high-pitched, martial arts cries)

840
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:58,599
Get him.

841
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:01,251
That was his plan?

842
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:03,437
You know what? I'm going in.
Shoot me if you have to.

843
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,322
(gun chamber clicks) casey: Hey!

844
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:09,393
(sighs)

845
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,094
You're fast.

846
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:14,464
Something else you should
know about me-- I love guns.

847
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:19,152
Good boy.

848
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:21,271
¶ ¶

849
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,379
(grunts)

850
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,165
Go! I got these guys.

851
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:43,727
Sydney: Check the cage.

852
00:33:50,768 --> 00:33:51,568
Oh!

853
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:55,939
(gun chamber clicks)

854
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:01,862
(groaning)

855
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:04,615
(grunting)

856
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:08,619
(groans)

857
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:12,422
(grunting)

858
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:21,598
(grunting)

859
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,051
(panting)

860
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:29,606
(gun chamber clicks)

861
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:34,194
(sighs)

862
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:38,865
(grunts)

863
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,567
Stop! Do not move!

864
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:42,536
(panting)

865
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,725
Or what? Hmm?

866
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:51,912
Please, just do what I say.

867
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:53,163
(sighs)

868
00:34:53,214 --> 00:34:54,748
Spies don't say please.

869
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:57,367
Now, devon--

870
00:34:57,418 --> 00:34:59,920
He would have had a bullet
between my eyes by now.

871
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:03,273
All right, fine, your choice-- live or die.

872
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:04,474
(panting)

873
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,593
That's better.

874
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:08,095
What are you doing? Do not do that.

875
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,379
<i>Do not do that!</i>

876
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,014
It's just the phone.

877
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:14,735
You do want it, don't you?

878
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:17,554
Or if you can't think of a use for it,

879
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:19,823
I'm sure I can.

880
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,392
I can make a phone call and have

881
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:23,910
50 operatives here.

882
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:26,663
Don't make me shoot you.

883
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,766
I don't think you can.

884
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,251
Sarah: Chuck!

885
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:34,371
(gunshot)

886
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,544
(body thuds, bullet casings clatter)

887
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,769
Like I said,

888
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:50,787
I hate guns,

889
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:53,156
But it pays to know how to use one.

890
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:06,645
<i>I suppose congratulations
are in order, chuck. </i>

891
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,130
Devon's identity has been contained.

892
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:10,516
We got lucky this time, shaw.

893
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:14,002
Yeah, and risked my family doing it.

894
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:17,305
There's something you need
to know about me, shaw.

895
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:19,408
There's nothing in my life

896
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:22,310
That I care about more than
my friends and my family.

897
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:25,230
Of course, I don't expect
you to understand that.

898
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:26,548
Being the spy that you are,

899
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,150
I'm sure that you don't care about anybody.

900
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:29,985
Families and friends make us vulnerable.

901
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:32,954
Make us unable to pull the trigger.

902
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:36,525
And that puts everyone
in even greater danger.

903
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,577
Just ask your partner here.

904
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,532
She'll tell you the same thing.

905
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:47,836
Sometimes it helps to know that
you've got something to lose.

906
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,432
(rhythmic clicking)

907
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:18,767
(singsongy): ¶ morgan! ¶

908
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:23,905
¶ come out and play-ay! ¶

909

910
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:29,995
¶ come out and play-ay! ¶

911
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,164
(laughter)

912
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:34,166
Big mike: Grimes!

913
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,117
Get over here!

914
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:41,389
You have got to get your
house in order, son.

915
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:42,891
I know. I know I do.

916
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,826
I-I just... I don't... I don't get it.

917
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:46,511
I thought we were all friends here.

918
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:48,063
You ain't.

919
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,931
First rule of big mike management:

920
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,733
You can't be afraid

921
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,635
To pull the trigger.

922
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:56,188
Right?

923
00:37:56,272 --> 00:37:57,823
Pull the trigger.

924
00:37:57,907 --> 00:37:59,524
Right.

925
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,830
Lester,

926
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:06,998
You know,

927
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:10,035
A wise man once told me that
you need to assess a problem

928
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,152
And then attack it head-on.

929
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:12,838
Hmm.

930
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,373
You... Are a problem.

931
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,675
Oh.

932
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:18,376
Your behavior will no longer be tolerated.

933
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:20,495
So, here are the first, second

934
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:22,497
And third rules of the buy more.

935
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:24,166
Do what you're told,

936
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:26,518
Do it with respect, or...

937
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:27,719
Or what?

938
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,337
Hmm?

939
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:31,056
You'll fight me?

940
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,440
(laughter)

941
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:34,442
(laughing)

942
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,727
No, I'll fire you.

943
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:37,229
You don't have the cojones.

944
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:40,215
Yeah.

945
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:41,015
No, you're fired.

946
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,400
Pack your hard drives

947
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:43,618
And get out of here.

948
00:38:43,686 --> 00:38:45,320
The rest of you, back to work.

949
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:47,155
Morgan, morgan, morgan,
morgan, come on, man.

950
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:48,790
Okay, look, hey.

951
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,292
We're just having a little fun.

952
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,459
Okay? I take it back.

953
00:38:51,527 --> 00:38:53,245
I take it back. Good-bye, lester.

954
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:55,363
Dude, don't do this. Don't do this, okay?

955
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:58,917
You know I need this job.
I got to get out of my mom's place.

956
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:00,385
Hmm.

957
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,203
For god's sake, man,
I've got nowhere else to go!

958
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:03,438
I've got nowhere else to go!

959
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:07,642
Yeah, okay, you're rehired.

960
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,927
(sighs)

961
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:09,978
But you're on probation.

962
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:11,062
Okay.

963
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:12,731
Double-secret.

964
00:39:12,815 --> 00:39:14,149
Double-secret?!

965
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:18,353
¶ ¶

966
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:22,357
Strong.

967
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:24,242
Real strong.

968
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:25,911
(barks)

969
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:27,445
Was that...?

970
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,564
A bigger dog, a medium-sized dog.

971
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:31,082
Bigger?

972
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:35,003
¶ ¶

973
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:47,148
(knocking on door)

974
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:48,967
Morgan: Hey, chuck, can you grab that, dude?

975
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,052
I'm-I'm wokin' and rollin' over here.

976
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:55,724
Hi-dilly-ho, neighbors.

977
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:57,091
Hi.

978
00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:58,860
Morgan: Yeah, hey, guys.

979
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,396
Welcome to our-- formerly-your-- home.

980
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:02,697
I hope everybody is hungry,

981
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:04,282
Because I made my teriyaki surprise.

982
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:07,285
The surprise is the teriyaki.

983
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,871
Think I've had enough surprises lately.

984
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,156
Oh, devon, stop it.

985
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,458
I'm sure we'll love it, morgan.

986
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,543
Mostly sure.

987
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:17,612
Hey, uh, buddy,

988
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:20,332
That thing that we were dealing with?

989
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:22,751
It's been taken care of.

990
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:23,885
We caught her.

991
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:25,971
Everything's gonna be just fine.

992
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:27,389
(sighs)

993
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:28,890
Oh.

994
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,092
There... There it is. That's enough of that.

995
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,727
Hey, what-what am I,
chopped scallions over here?

996
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:35,680
There's no love for buy more's
new assistant manager, or...?

997
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:37,399
What? That's great.

998
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:38,650
Congratulations.

999
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:41,152
Assistant manager?

1000
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:42,904
Congratulations, buddy.

1001
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:44,572
Honey, you're hurting him. Put him down.

1002
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,658
Oh. (knocking on door)

1003
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:49,110
Oh, uh, el, I hope you don't mind,
but I-I invited sarah,

1004
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:50,278
As well.

00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:51,746
Oh, really? I'll get the door.

1006
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:54,833

1007
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:56,284
What?!

1008
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:57,953
Hi, ellie. Hi, sarah.

1009
00:40:58,004 --> 00:40:59,487
Good to see you.

1010
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:02,323
Hello, ellie. Casey.

1011
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,209
You've had enough of that.

1012
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:08,263
(whispers): What's with her?

1013
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,931
No idea.

1014
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,017
Hi.

1015
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:13,518
Hi.

1016
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:16,888
It wouldn't have been the
same without you, so,

1017
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm really glad you made it.

1018

Me, too.
