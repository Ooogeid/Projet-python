1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,040
before you do anything rash,I think
you should know that I have the cipher.

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,050
I handt over right now.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,590
Don't you think we should
discuss terms first?

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,740
now... who are you?

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,340
You know what?You probably
wouldn't believe me.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,910
Last chance.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,050
Who are you?

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,690
Chuck.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,440
Okay.Now,tell me everything,chuck.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,640
- There is no way he's going to believe me.
- And I don't blame him.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,030
I mean,who would believe that the government put all
their secrets into one super computer--the intersect.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,780
And all those secrets got
downloaded into my brain.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,560
of course I can't tell this guy that.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,470
O-okay,okay.Okay,see th-the thing is
I-I kind of sort of work for the cia

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,870
and the nsa in my off hours when
I'm not working at the store.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,070
It's kind of like a second job for me.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,390
And though I don't look
it-- being lanky of build¡ª

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,980
you should know that I'm probably the most
important intelligence asset In the world.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,760
That is the single dumbest
story I've ever heard.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,400
That very well may
be,but... if you drop me,

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,590
there are a couple of people who
are going to be very,very upset.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,480
meet sarah and casey.

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,850
They're here to protect me.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,340
At th's sarah.She works for the cia.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,460
Believe me,I know.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,040
And that's casey.He works for the nsa.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,240
He's not as pretty.

28
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,690
Let eke ge go!

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,660
Wait!Not out the window.

30
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,280
Aren't we picky.

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,820
nice hands,casey.

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,700
Why didn't you stay in the car?

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,050
You know what?

34
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,610
It's never safe in the car.

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,160
Well,did you get it?

36
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,580
Tell me you got it.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,030
I got it.

38
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,210
'Course I got it.It's me.

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,130
Excellent work,sarah,casey.

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,550
Our transporters will be taking
the cipher out of los angeles.

41
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,560
General,what exactly is the cipher?

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
I mean,mercenaries
break into the nsa lab,

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,800
and it's the only thing they take?

44
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,220
The cipher is the artificial brain
for the new intersect computer.

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,340
The new intersect?

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,320
We've been working on a new one ever
since the original intersect was destroyed.

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,080
The cipher is the final piece.

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,450
Uh,wait,time out just for a second here.

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,150
What-what happens to
me,the old intersect?

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,990
Tomorrow,the new computer will be online,and
operation bartowski officially comes to an end.

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,580
You'll be done with us.

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,190
No more briefings,no more
missions,no more spies.

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,030
Enjoy the rest of your life,chuck.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,070
Are you okay,chuck?

55
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,530
Yeah,I'm,uh,uh... I
mean,I-I don't believe it

56
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,440
but-but,uh,I-I
think I'm great!

57
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,160
You're going to get your old life back.

58
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,800
Yeah,I was starting to think that you and casey
were going to be my spy protectors forever.

59
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,320
Or,whatever the adult
version of forever is.

60
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,120
Don't tell me you're
going to miss all of this.

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,660
No.No,of course not.

62
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,710
I don't think I'm really cut out for a job where you
disarm a bomb,steal a diamond,and then jump off a building.

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,160
Well,you could have fooled me.

64
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,810
That's very kind of you to say,but I'm pretty sure
my girlish screams in the face of danger give me away.

65
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,050
So,what happens now?

66
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,390
You're almost free.What
are you going to do next?

67
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,240
Well,you know I got the buy more...

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,610
- chuck,can I tell you something?
- Of course.

69
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,730
You can do anything.I've
seen you in action.

70
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,800
And I'm not just talking about the
bomb defusing,or the diamond stealing.

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,910
I mean,anything you
wanted,you could have.

72
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,190
- I thought you might call.
- Major casey,you understand the situation?

73
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,020
We can't have another intersect wandering
around los angeles getting into trouble.

74
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,900
General,chuck may be a novice spy,but
the results speak for themselves.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,010
Surely we can find
another exit strategy.

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,360
You have your orders,major.

77
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,940
Tomorrow night,eliminate
chuck bartowski.

78
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,800
I used to like the sound of that.

82
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,220
morning,chuck.

83
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,390
My eyes!My eyes!

84
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,050
Oh,I'm blind!I'm blind!

85
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,420
Okay,first of all,congratulations,devon.

86
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,170
On the... on what-- you know
whatever god gave you there.

87
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,630
Second of all,the door was not
locked,so I'm not a complete pervert.

88
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,940
And third of all,this is just another
reminder of why I need my own place.

89
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,890
There's no rush,chuck.It's
great having you here.

90
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,570
So,ellie,I've been,I've been thinking a lot
about stuff,you know,like,uh,my life and my job.

91
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,000
Unburden yourself,chuck--
where's that head of yours?

92
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,350
I don't know,I just think
you guys are right,you know?

93
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,030
I shouldn't,I shouldn't be working at a buy
more,right?I should have a real job with a real future.

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,780
What happened?

95
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,920
You know when you meet someone
and they just kind of,you know,

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,120
they-they flip you on your head,just
shake things up,a little bit?

97
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,960
You're talking about a mr.Tony robbins.

98
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,510
So close.And yet so far away.Honestly.

99
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,770
- I got to go.I'm sorry.We'll talk about it later.
- No,no.

100
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,500
Talk to me,chuck; I need to know if
this is a good thing or a bad thing.

101
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,590
No,no,it's A... it's a good thing.

102
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,630
It's a very-- it's not a tony
robbins cult thing.I want this,so.

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,150
Okay.Okay,great,well,then
I'm really happy for you.

104
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,820
I'm,like,super excited right now,and
I'm just trying to keep it in.

105
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,490
Of course.So... which
is healthier,I think.

106
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,500
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

107
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,380
I'm so proud of you!

108
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,500
okay,I love you.See ya.

109
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,760
Chuck,come here.

110
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,330
What's up,buddy?

111
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,950
Large mart goons; c theyould be
anywhere.I don't want them to see this.

112
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,530
What is this?

113
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,930
Compound level from call of duty.

114
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,540
After our last battle with those large
mart douches,I started to work on this.

115
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,050
Planning how we could take 'em all out.

116
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,230
All right,listen up.Here
are the specs,are you ready?

117
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,810
23 infantry troopers,16 snipers,seven
heavy gunners,four demolitions experts,

118
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,010
and enough ammunition to orbit arnold
schwarzenegger.50 gamers,one call,all ready for battle.

119
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,110
With this team assembled,and
my plan,I think we can beat 'em.

120
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,360
Morgan,you are my new hero.

121
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,840
I know.I know.

122
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,370
Uh,hey,uh,can I talk to you
about this later?Uh,roger that.

123
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,510
Oh,big mike was looking for you.I told him I
would send you his way as soon as you arrived.

124
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,410
Message delivevered.Your
work here is done.

125
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,350
Hey,casey,casey,casey,casey,casey.

126
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,630
Um,do you have a second?Just
a quick,quick second.

127
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,990
Not now,I've got a single white
female pining for the beastmaster.

128
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,610
It's a quick-- it's justqu
a ick second I promise.

129
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,350
What is it?

130
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,110
Just wanted to say thank you.

131
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm leaving.No,hey,hey,wait,wait,wait.

132
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,390
- Hand.
- Sorry.

133
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,130
I was-- forget
about that.

134
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,950
Um,look,I just... I just want
to say I'm going to miss you,man.

135
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,540
You know,and-and-and thank you
for showing me how to do things

136
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,220
that I never thought were
possible,and,and you know what?

137
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,800
You were always there
to catch me when I fell,

138
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,550
which sounds horribly cheesy
now that I'm saying it aloud.

139
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,870
Really.Forget it.

140
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,140
Bartowski!

141
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,030
Bartowski,bartowski.

142
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,950
- Yes,big mike?
- The assistant managership.

143
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,890
The number-two spot here at
the buy more,my right-hand man,

144
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,480
the captain of the ship when I'm not
around,which,as we both know,is often.

145
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Here's the thing-- corporate
is on my ass to fill the spot,

146
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,600
but I really don't want to
interview those characters out there.

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,130
- Your employees?
- Exactly,they scare me,chuck.

148
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,990
So...

149
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,730
...want the job?

150
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,420
Well,chuck,do you?

151
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,230
all hail the once and future
assistant manager-- chuck bartowski!

152
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,980
The sleeper has awoken!

153
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,480
Morgan... behold the dawn of
a new age here at the buy more.

154
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,500
I,as your lieutenant,will institute
policies that we've have always wanted.

155
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,870
Right,team?

156
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,920
- Hooray.
- Hurrah.

157
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,550
Morgan,I didn't take the job.

158
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,960
What?Why,oh,why,oh,why,chuck?

159
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,610
I'm also here to inform you that
big mike has ordered me to interview

160
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,870
and choose the new assistant
store manager as my punishment.

161
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,850
- References go to you,charles?
- Or morgan!

162
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
See ya; I got a resum?to nail.

163
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,580
If I get the job,you
should quiver in fear.

164
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,160
Listen to me,listen to
me.Chuck,chuck,you being the A.M.

165
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,220
And me being the right hand to the
A.M.Was what we always dreamed of.

166
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm not,I'm not completely convinced that the
buy more is where I want to work forever,you know.

167
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,650
Got it.Where would we work then?

168
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,330
Where would... where would we... we?

169
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,970
Uh,I don't know.Wherever.

170
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,160
It's sarah,right?She's finally done it.

171
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,640
No,what,done what?

172
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,750
You know,it makes perfect
sense,too,come to think of it.

173
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,910
I mean,if you were going to choose someone over
me and all that we've built,it should be her.

174
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,150
I mean,she is-- unironically
speaking-- awesome.

175
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,760
So can I be completely honest?

176
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,560
- Yeah.
- I miss the wienerlicious.

177
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,940
I mean,the bavarian charm and the toxic
nacho cheese that you guys had there.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,900
My clothes smelled like sausage.

179
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,090
Nostalgia completely gone.

180
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,160
So what's up?

181
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,990
You want to go on a date sometime?

182
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,730
I mean a date without aliases
and spy gear and a mission?

183
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,070
Like a real date?

184
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,770
Yeah.

185
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,630
Chuck... I'm still a cia agent,and there are
a hundred reasons why I shouldn't do that.

186
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,860
What do you have to lose?In a week,you're going
to be undercover in some place like jakarta

187
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,210
in a knife fight with some
evil-doer,and in that exact moment,

188
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,950
you're going to wish that you would've
spent one last... night of fun with me.

189
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,190
Okay.

190
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,940
Really?

191
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,690
Tonight.

192
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,890
- Our first real date.
- Or our second first date.

193
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,620
- No gunfight,I promise.
- Okay.

194
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,080
Hey,date tonight?

195
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,300
Yeah,yeah-- we're going to go grab some chinese
food and then maybe hit the echo after that.

196
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,660
Did you hear that,devon?

197
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,650
Do you recognize the sound of
a proper date when you hear it?

198
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,800
My tank's empty,babe.

199
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,780
That's my future husband.

200
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,480
What about you?Any revelations?Any
ideas about what you're going to do next?

201
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,300
Um... yeah,a few.

202
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,870
If you say "pilot the millennium
falcon," I will hit you.

203
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,550
I-- why would
I say that?

204
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,620
That's absurd.I'm going
to be a ninja assassin.

205
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,150
No,try again.

206
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,710
olympic...

207
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,830
Secret agent.

208
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,930
This is what happens when you sit in
front of the television set too long.

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,550
Seriously,what are you going to do?

210
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,750
I-I don't know.I've got
a bunch of ideas,you know?

211
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,040
A bunch of things to think
about and choose from.

212
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,920
I mean,I want to go finish college.

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,670
I mean,I think that's important.And
I want to travel and... I don't know.

214
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
I want to learn an obscure language
that,you know,only really cool people know.

215
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,780
oddly enough,not one of my dreams includes
working at the buy more for another week.

216
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,440
Well,look who's growing up.

217
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,900
that'll be sarah.

218
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,970
What's up,dude?I know you have
a date.Not gonna get in the way.

219
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,550
Just wondering if you have five to 45 minutes
to test out a new call of duty strategy?

220
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,350
- Chuck...
- baby steps,sis.

221
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,940
Baby steps.

222
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,590
yeah?

223
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,010
Messenger.

224
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,170
pickup call placed by one G.Beckman.

225
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,640
- Verification code?
- Morning glory.

226
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,220
Where's your backup?

227
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,840
it's done.

228
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,170
I've got the cipher.

229
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,340
Go to the second location.

230
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,080
We have two more targets.

231
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,600
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,810
****************

233
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,420
So how'd you hear
about this place,anyway?

234
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,180
Morgan,as a matter of fact.

235
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,350
The man has a black belt in dumplings.

236
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,110
I trust any recommendation he gives me
for food items less than ten dollars.

237
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,480
So our first date is a
morgan recommendation?

238
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,980
Wow,no faith in the
little bearded man.Okay.

239
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,870
I think you should know he's always
been supportive of our fake relationship.

240
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,000
And he's never found it remotely unbelievable
that a guy like me could be dating,um...

241
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,160
- you know.
- What?

242
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,830
Um... you know,you.

243
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,800
What about me?

244
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,690
You're really going to
make me say it,aren't you?

245
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,460
You--
wow,okay.Fine.

246
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,700
All right,we'll play it your way.

247
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,710
A girl like you.

248
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,930
Or more appropriately,a woman like you.

249
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,890
Considering the fact that you could probably
kick the ass of everyone in this joint.

250
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,610
And A... a smart one at that.

251
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,980
Not to mention cool and...

252
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,100
extremely beautiful.

253
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,850
And,and you can stop me anytime with
the compliments if they're becoming,

254
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,330
- you know...
- no.

255
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,410
No,that was very sweet.

256
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,410
Sweet?

257
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,510
Golly gee,thanks for making
me feel like I'm eight.

258
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,550
Well,you're not so bad yourself.

259
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,180
Please.

260
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,160
I'm fantastic.

261
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,080
Yeah.You are.

262
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,540
What would casey think if he
knew we were doing this right now?

263
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,830
It would probably kill him.

264
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,610
sorry,sir.

265
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,520
so does it say where you're,uh,going
next?Your new mission?

266
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,860
Actually,it does.

267
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,610
- Really?
- No,not really.

268
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,230
Besides,it doesn't work that way.

269
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,970
They'll probably give me a new cover,and
move me as far away from here as possible.

270
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,180
What if they didn't?

271
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,970
Chuck,a cia officer
doesn't get to choose.

272
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,130
You know,I-I still have an
awful lot of secrets in my head:

273
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,890
The lindbergh baby, the
formula for new coke...

274
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,730
what are you saying,chuck?

275
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,510
What I've always wanted to say,sarah.

276
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,610
no no no no noNot now.

277
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,680
chuck,what is it?

278
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,620
We're surrounded.

279
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,910
Sarah,you have your gun,right?

280
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,610
- Nope.
- What?Why not?

281
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,860
You don't bring a gun on a real date.

282
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,130
Hello again,chuck.

283
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,870
- And you are?
- My name is mr.Colt.

284
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,710
And I need you to come with me.

285
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,890
Now why would we do that,mr.Colt?

286
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,040
'Cause I assume you find me imposing.

287
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,740
Don't worry,be honest.

288
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,330
I'm going for imposing.

289
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,590
Mission accomplished.

290
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,180
Well,I'll tell you what.

291
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,750
The people that hired me...
give me the heebie-jeebies.

292
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,160
You know,when you put it
in context like that,I-I...

293
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,690
let's go.We'll take care of the check.

294
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,270
Um,you know,are you sure? let's go.The
moo goo gai pan is very expensive here,

295
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,560
so we could probably
go dutch or something.

296
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,120
How much do bad guys normally tip?

297
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,530
- sarah.
- Move and she dies.

298
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,860
what is that?

299
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,590
It's a honing device.

300
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,480
Is that a crown victoria?

301
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,100
Move!

302
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,010
- Somebody order
drive-thru?- Go!Go!

303
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,480
- Casey,drive!
- *****

304
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,660
Somebody order drive-thru,huh?

305
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,580
Yo did u think that up as you
were racing over to save us?

306
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,130
"Hey,maybe I'll say this after
I crash into the restaurant!

307
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,340
"Casey,we have to go back and
find out who they work for.

308
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,150
Too many of 'em,we can'T.

309
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,670
Well,at least we still have the cipher.

310
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,180
Yeah,about that...

311
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,260
looks like you're still
the intersect,chuck.

312
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,510
- Sarah...
- don't worry,chuck.

313
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,440
We'll get it back.

314
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,040
Yo,chuck.Got all the
resum together for you.

315
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,970
What?

316
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,350
The assistant manager spot.

317
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,630
You have to pick our boss,man.

318
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,850
you know what,morgan?I'm
making my decision right now.

319
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,530
I want you to be the assistant manager.

320
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,910
Choa,uck,relax.

321
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,100
Let's think about this.

322
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,620
See,I have this perfect system for
doing as little work as possible.

323
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,090
It's a science,really,doing nothing.

324
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,140
A promotion at this point
would destroy all my hard work.

325
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
You're telling me I have no choice.

326
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,720
The die has been cast.

327
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,370
- But I'm gonna be here every step of the way.
- That's comforting.

328
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,540
Okay,so the first
interview up is... anna wu.

329
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,820
um,okay,anna,well,your-your resum?has
some really interesting items.

330
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,510
- Is it true that you're trained in the art of...
- tell him to leave.

331
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,250
- I'm sorry,what?
- Orll mgan to leave.

332
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,210
I'm just trying to find the
right applicant,buddy,that's all.

333
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,840
- It's scented.
- Is it?

334
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,180
Rose.oh,honey,would you close the door?

335
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,760
Thank you.Thanks,sugar.

336
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,880
We're alone.

337
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,450
Anna,what exactly are you doing?

338
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,630
X.

339
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,970
Rela I like making my boyfriend nervous.

340
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,830
Howdy.Howdy.

341
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,080
What is this?Is this trash?Am
I supposed to throw this away?

342
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,160
It's my resum?

343
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,430
You-you've,uh,you've been working
here since the store opened?

344
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,940
Very detailed.

345
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,550
Very thorough.

346
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,820
I'm noticing here that you
have a wikipedia entry...

347
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,390
bingo.

348
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,690
...Of yourself.

349
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,910
I have a certain following.

350
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,590
What do you think he thinks
is happening in here right now?

351
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,480
An interview,I hope.

352
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:58,460
Well,um,you know,that's actually something
that I never,ever wanted to know about you.

353
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,180
- What else can I tell you?
- Nothing.

354
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,020
No,no,no,no.Chuck,you know
what?No more questions.

355
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,920
- Guy needs professional help.
- That's not,that's not called for.

356
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,990
Or... or welcome.

357
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,600
Very unwelcome,actually.

358
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,830
I take care of my friends,chuck.

359
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,010
I,uh... I help those who help me.

360
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,910
okay,here's the thing: We're at the
buy more,and this is not the mafia.

361
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,000
Interesting,interesting.

362
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,490
Hey,whoa.Mr.Bartowski's
conducting an interview.

363
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,060
I... That happens a lot.Deserved.

364
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,320
OK Uh,lester,could you
excuse me for a second?

365
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,600
And,morgan,I need to talk
to casey by myself,thanks.

366
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,310
No,yeah,absolutely,it was great.Yeah,take your
resum?Great job,awesome.Get out of here,please.

367
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,690
Morgan,now,now,now!

368
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,110
Move it,move it,move it!Shut the door.

369
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,890
What is it?I know where they are.

370
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,300
- Who?Who?What do you mean,who?
- Colt!

371
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,350
The guy who smashed you
in the face last night.

372
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,780
Yeah,I flashed on your scar.

373
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,400
It's the emblem for their organization.

374
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,140
They have a secret hideout downtown.

375
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,250
Warehouse 17 on 103rd street.

376
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,100
- We'll hop in the herder...
- cool your jets,hotshot.I'll call it in.

377
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,270
What do you mean call it in?There's no
time!They could be on the move already.

378
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,760
Relax.

379
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,010
I'm not gonna rush us into a hideout situation
until I'm absolutely certain we have the upper hand.

380
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,860
We'll get the cipher.

381
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,020
Just might take some time.

382
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,050
Casey,I can't take this anymore.Do
you understand what I'm saying?

383
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,740
I cannot do this anymore!

384
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,950
I almost died twice in the
period of one day,all right?

385
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,850
And when I'm looking at my life and what my future
could be,I see that it doesn't completely suck.

386
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,990
Your intersect,your new
intersect is almost done.

387
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,190
And when it is,I'm free,I'm
cool,I'm clear,I'm out of here.

388
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,390
I have a future and a
life that I want to live.

389
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,920
Future's a dangerous thing,chuck.Doesn't
always work out like you want it to.

390
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,620
What happened to you?You were this close to
being done with me and being a real spy again.

391
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,820
What?You don't you want me
here to catch you when you fall?

392
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,860
No,as a matter of fact,I'd rather have
you flying jets and blowing things up.

393
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,370
Wait here.

394
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,920
- Hey,big guy,
- what about the interviews,pal?

395
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,020
What?Uh,oh,I don't
know,but you're in charge.

396
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,660
No,no,no.I can't,I
can't do the interviews.

397
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,160
I-I don't make decisions like that.

398
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,490
People talk to me,and I just kind
of tune them out and nod my head.

399
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,470
I'd be making the decision blind.

400
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,260
Fine,fine,fine,fine,use
your own method.I trust you.

401
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,630
Really?

402
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,950
That such a good idea?

403
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,530
What is my method?

404
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,880
Hey,what's happening?You're
going down there,aren't you?

405
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,570
We're on it,chuck.

406
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,930
- What-what's back there?- Well,like
the sign says,yogurt and fun.

407
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,180
Let me come along.You got
to bring charles carmichael.

408
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,040
You remember,debonair superspy,who also happens
to have the intersect in his head?You know,me?

409
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,310
I can help you guys.

410
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,370
Charles carmichael isn't your
real name,chuck.You made him up.

411
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,010
You're just chuck bartowski,and
you're not a real spy,huh?

412
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,640
We have a tactical team meeting us
at the location that you gave casey.

413
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,280
We'll take down colt and find the
cipher,and you go back to work.

414
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,280
Don't worry about the buy more.I put
morgan in charge of the job search.

415
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,620
He's got it under control.

416
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,190
Welcome to thunderdome!

417
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,910
It is the ancient way!

418
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,010
To the victor go the spoils!

419
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,690
One of them will be the new assistant
manager and one of them will be jeff!

420
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,620
The fates will decide!

421
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,600
Begin!

422
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,220
anna?Jeff?Lester?

423
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,730
Bartowski!

424
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,240
Computer emergency!

425
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,610
Hey,where is everybody?

426
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,850
Don't care.

427
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,760
Just got a call for nerd herd help.

428
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,460
They said they got a
recommendation for you.

429
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,580
Well,can I send someone else or
did they ask for me specifically?

430
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,350
You know I hate taking calls.

431
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,060
Get going!

432
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,330
Go,go,go,open.Open up.

433
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,610
- **
- Chuck was wrong.

434
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,550
Or he was right,and we
didn't move fast enough.

435
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,740
Buy more nerd herd.Hello.

436
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,450
I'm here about the...

437
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,870
...computer emergency.

438
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,870
Hello,chuck.Come on in.

439
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,440
call chuck.I got a feeling.

440
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,490
Nothing.I'll try buy more.

441
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,900
Morgan,where's chuck?

442
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,200
So,uh,what-what,uh,seems
to be your computer problem?

443
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,610
Here's the problem,chuck.

444
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,000
You saw my face and you heard my voice.

445
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,560
That's not a problem.That's
not a problem at all.

446
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,750
I forget things all the time.Ask
my sister; I forgot her birthday.

447
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,430
I forget my social security number.Just
anything,ask me,I'll forget it.

448
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,320
what exactly are you doing?

449
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,230
I'm stretching,getting limber.

450
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,010
Why are you doing that?

451
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,500
So I won't pull a muscle
when I break your neck.

452
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,570
Maybe you should get limber,too.

453
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,020
Where you going?

454
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,410
There's nobody here to help you.

455
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,490
Oh,your friends,that's right.

456
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,130
They're next on my to do"" list."

457
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,740
See,you walked into a trap,chuck...
if that is your real name.

458
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,710
My name is charles carmichael.

459
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,660
I'm a cia agent,and this is my trap.

460
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,600
I don't think you gentlemen realize the
gravity of the predicament that you're in.

461
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,530
See,that phone call you made to
the buy more?Yeah,we traced that.

462
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,970
Your compound is currently
surrounded by 23 infantry troopers,

463
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,330
16 snipers,seven heavy
gunners,four demolitions experts,

464
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,000
and enough ammunition to
orbit arnold schwarzenegger.

465
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,510
You're outmatched and you're outgunned.

466
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,580
Those peashooters you're holding might as
well be sharp sticks and strong language.

467
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,380
Nothing there,boss.

468
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,140
Looks clear.

469
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,310
good try,chuck.

470
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,520
Of course you don't see anyone.

471
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,180
Who do you think
we are-- the fbi?

472
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,500
The only thing you're going to see is a muzzle
flash,followed by an e-ticket straight to hell.

473
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,650
So make the smart choice and...
why don't you hand over the cipher?

474
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,570

Wait,w-w-wa-wai-wait,wait,wait.

475
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,820
I think that,uh... I think that
you might want to hear this.

476
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,350
hey,chuck.

477
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,980
- Hey,morgan.
- Yeah,yeah,chuck.

478
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,930
Morgan,I'd like you to tell me the exact
specs for the team surrounding the compound.

479
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,560
The whole shebang?

480
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,790
The whole shebang.

481
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,880
Yes,sir,we have 23 infantry troopers,16 snipers,seven
heavy gunners,and four demolitions experts.

482
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,640
I should tell you I got a little impatient
and we took out one of the sentries.

483
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,070
Don't worry,it was a head
shot.He couldn't warn his buddies.

484
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,330
It was awesome,man,you should have seen
it.His head exploded like a watermelon.

485
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,660
- Thanks,morgan.
- They must have got fritz.

486
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,610
I thought he was in the can.

487
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,420
One more time.

488
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,300
Give up.

489
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,250
He's either lying,or he's crazy.

490
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,380
Check everywhere.

491
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,420
Don't let anything get past you.

492
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,640
This is agents casey and walker.

493
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,440
We're en route.

494
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,780
Don't move.

495
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,920
Please,don't move.

496
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,010
hey,no.

497
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,430
Hand it over.

498
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,570
What'll you do if I give it to you?

499
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,720
To be honest,I'm gonna drop you.

500
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,380
See,thi-this is what I'm talking about.

501
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,480
We got to work on your
negotiating skills.

502
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,530
How about this?

503
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,360
How about you pull me back up and we just
discuss this like two rational adults?

504
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,440
You know what?

505
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,450
- What?
- Freeze!

506
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,190
It ain't worth it.

507
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,530
no!

508
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,850
your boyfriend's dead
now,baby.What you gonna do?

509
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,840
- you,you...
- yeah,I catch you when you fall.

510
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,780
- It's touching,really.
- No,no,I love you.

511
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,460
Keep it in your pants,bartowski.

512
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,330
Now get downstairs.

513
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,660
Okay,enough with the foreplay.

514
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,990
Step away from the blonde.

515
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,100
Ah,you know you got
to put that gun down.

516
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,790
Ain't nobody else here.

517
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,660
Meet the rest of my men.Drop it,chief.

518
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,550
excuse me.

519
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,660
Excuse me,hi.

520
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,050
Sorry to,uh... uh,sorry to interrupt
whatever's going on here,but,uh,mr.Colt,

521
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,030
I just wanted you to meet my team.

522
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,460
Tell me something.Do
you find them imposing?

523
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,630
Go ahead,you can be honest.

524
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,800
I was going for imposing.

525
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,130
Chuck.

526
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,740
Carmichael.

527
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,000
Agent carmichael.

528
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,680
Maybe you could go ahead
and put your weapons down.

529
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,420
I said put your weapons down!

530
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:59,310
Oh,there you go,there you-- and then,and then
the hands up to imply that your hands are empty.

531
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,550
Your boss,carmichael.

532
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,100
- What?
- He's good.

533
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,310
Don't
worry,I-I-I'm fine.

534
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,740
Do you have the cipher?

535
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,190
Please tell me you have it.

536
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,350
Of course I have it.It's me.

537
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,320
major casey.

538
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,720
Hope I'm not interrupting.

539
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,810
The new intersect ready?

540
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,010
We're minutes away.

541
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,950
- Which means...
- your order remains the same.

542
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,960
Chuck bartowski is to be eliminated.

543
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,940
what was that,casey?

544
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,800
Nothing,general.It's just...

545
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,600
chuck's served his country with honor.

546
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,600
Maybe he even has potential as
an analyst for the organization.

547
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,560
- I unders...
- let me,general.

548
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,640
Major casey,can you extract these
secrets from mr.Bartowski's head?

549
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,670
Can you guarantee him safety
from kidnapping,from torture?

550
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,830
- No.
- Then it's clear.

551
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,140
Chuck bartowski has served
his country with honor.

552
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,510
Now he'll die with honor to protect it.

553
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,860
You sure you can handle it?

554
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,330
yeah,yeah,I think i
can do this,thank you.

555
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Plus,I've wanted to cook dinner
for sarah for a while,so...

556
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,130
you have many skills,chuck,but
the kitchen is not one of them.

557
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,010
Oh,but that's why they
call it hamburger helper.

558
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,430
Hello,does most of the
heavy lifting for me.

559
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,310
I'm making that,uh,that chicken with balsamic
glaze,the one thing dad taught me how to make.

560
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,470
But dad couldn't cook either.

561
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,860
Babe,you ready?

562
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,610
Mongolian bbq beckons.

563
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,540
Going for the record,chuck.Seven
pounds,shredded beef.

564
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,020
- I've been fasting.
- Please,let me help you.

565
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,250
The man has been on a hunger
strike.Come on,go eat,I'll be fine.

566
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,200
You sure about that?

567
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,780
Yeah.

568
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,520
Yes,I'll be fine.

569
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,920
Oh,hey,and I also had an
idea for what I'm going to do.

570
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,910
I was thinking maybe,like,eurorail through
europe,uh,you know,backpacking,that kind of thing.

571
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,390
- That sounds...
- awesome.

572
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,930
Remind me to tell you
about amsterdam,my man.

573
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,900
lovely city,lot of canals.

574
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,120
It's a great idea,chuck;
good luck tonight.

575
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,290
- Good luck,bud.
- Hey,you,too.

576
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,130
And remember,buddy,pace yourself.

577
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,120
It's a marathon.

578
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,360
so,sarah,what do you,what do you think
of,um,what do you think of europe?

579
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,660
You,me,a couple of... eurorail passes?

580
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,890
Just seeing the world.

581
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,430
Seeing,seeing the world.

582
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,190
What the hell?Ask her...

583
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,430
- hey,sarah.
- CHUCK

584
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,610
What is it?

585
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,040
We have to call off the
date.The intersect was destroyed.

586
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,510
What?But the cipher...

587
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,610
it was a trojan horse,a sabotage device.

588
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,370
The moment it came online,it exploded.

589
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,260
- But that means...
- you're still the only intersect.

590
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,470
I'm sorry.

591
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,710
- hello,charles.
- Chuck's fine.

592
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,740
Actuno,ally,he isn'T.You see,as
the assistant manager and your boss,

593
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,130
it's my duty to inform you that I have had
several complaints from customers about you.

594
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,160
Oh,you have,have you?

595
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,880
Not specifically.

596
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,660
But I haven't had any compliments,and
in my book that's the same thing.

597
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,630
Yeah?Good.

598
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,840
How's it going,chuck?

599
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,230
How's it going?That's
a,that's a great question.

600
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,730
I'll tell you,buddy.

601
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,150
I just had a vision,okay?

602
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,190
A vision of the rest of
my life.And you know what?

603
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,950
It takes place in the same outfit,behind
the same desk,in the same store.

604
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,170
Got you.

605
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,380
Talk to dr.Morgan.

606
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,630
It's safe,go ahead.

607
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,540
I just thought I'd be going somewhere,you
know,not just metaphysically or spiritually-but..

608
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,500
- I want,you know,out of burbank to,to...
- glendale.

609
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,930
all right,listen,look at me.

610
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,230
In all honesty,and I hope you know this,I've always
been of the mind that you are destined for great things.

611
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:40,540
Whatever you want to do,you can do-- all right,senator,president,emperor
of the known universe,whatever you want to do.

612
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,030
You understand?

613
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,110
Yeah.You're good.

614
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,630
But before you go running off to change
the world,I think that I should tell you

615
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,800
that I am currently on my
way to securing 45 twinkies.

616
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,270
Now,by which I mean 45 bags of twinkies.

617
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,410
Why would you do that?Good question.

618
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,100
Because jeff said he'd eat all
of them in under three minutes.

619
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,540
Now,he thinks he's eating 45,but
technically speaking,he agreed to eat 90.

620
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,390
- 90?
- Yeah.

621
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,060
- Nobody can eat 90 twinkies.
- That's what I said,dude.

622
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,920
He may die o-or at least do extreme
damage to several major organs.

623
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,500
This I have to see.

624
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,230
Good to see you,bartowski.

625
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,810
Hey,casey,90 twinkies in
three minutes.Be there.

626
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,290
- Jeff might die.
- No way!
