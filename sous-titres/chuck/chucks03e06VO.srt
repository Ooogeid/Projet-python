1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,244
Devon is out of the spy business for good.

2
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,796
Please don't say another mission, chuck.

3
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:10,581
You're back!

4
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:12,049
<i>I'm hannah.</i>

5
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:13,618
If you ever find yourself in burbank,

00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:15,619
<i>My assistant manager owes me about</i>

00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,221
<i>A million and a half favors.</i>

00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:28,232
Stop the presses!

Who is that? Vicky vale...

00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:32,436

<i>Do you remember when sarah first
walked into the buy more?</i>

14
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:40,795
What was it like?

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,580
Was it love at first sight?

16
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,683
¶ ¶

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,398
I don't know, but whatever it was,

18
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,400
It changed my life forever. Why?

19
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:03,484
No reason.

20
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:04,635
Morning, guys.

21
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:05,770
Hi.

22
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:07,438
Hey. Morning.

23
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,141
All right, everybody, back to work!

24
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:15,145
Real taskmaster, that, uh, morgan.

25
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:16,697
yeah, I can tell.

26
00:01:16,782 --> 00:01:18,115
So, my first day

27
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,668
As a nerd herder-- any advice?

28
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:21,986
Oh.

29
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:23,371
Uh, let's see, well, let's start

30
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:24,789
With the five-cent tour, shall we?

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,124
I like to consider myself the jack hannah

32
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:29,293
Of this untamed wilderness.

33
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,461
Me, safe;

34
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,546
Everyone else, very dangerous.

35
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:34,465
Yeah, a little creepy.

36
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,000
But I am sure

37
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,301
That you will protect me.

38
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:39,270
Indeed, indeed.

39
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,389
You stay by us, sister; you'll be safe.

40
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:42,523
Charles.

41
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:43,674
Hannah, lester,

42
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:44,775
Jeff.

43
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,360
Two of the finest members

44
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:47,979
Of our buy moron staff.

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,647
<i>Hannah, namaste.</i>

46
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,401
Nice.

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,205
All right, why don't we
give jeff an opportunity

48
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,540
To realize that he's in public?

49
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,858
Thank you.

50
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,661
So, I was going through the
nerd herd manual last night,

51
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:06,697
And I have a few questions
about how to file an install.

52
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:08,198
Let me get this straight.

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,135
You went over the nerd herd
manual in your off time?

54
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:12,870
Are you gonna be a problem employee?

55
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,872
Look, I know this isn't my dream job,

56
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:16,557
But I thought that while I'm here,

57
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:19,209
I would be the best nerd herder you have.

58
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:20,761
Well, as you probably saw,

59
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:22,263
That's not an insurmountable goal.

60
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:24,982
You must be pretty committed,
going to paris on an install?

61
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,400
Yeah, uh, uh...

62
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:29,553
Um, you know, about... About t
h-that whole paris thing-- can we

63
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:30,988
Just keep that between the two of us?

64
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:32,990
I don't want everyone
else getting jealous...

65
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:34,742
Yogurt time.

66
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,661
Oh, is it... Is it yogurt time already?

67
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,228
Uh, yogurt, most important meal of the day.

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,664
But don't worry,

69
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:41,732
I will give you the full
chuck bartowski tutorial

70
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:43,117
When I get back, I promise.

71
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,172
I'm gonna totally hit that.

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,591
May the best stalker win.

73
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:51,959
Oops.

74
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:57,631
Hey, where's shaw?

75
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,433
Off grid on a covert mission.

76
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:01,435
It's not your concern

77
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,637
Where agent shaw is, mr. Bartowski.

78
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:05,106
Oh, uh, that's actually

79
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,308
<i>Agent bartowski no
w- I don't know if you heard,</i>

80
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,810
But I completed my first
solo mish last week.

81
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:11,896
Paris. International op.

82
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,232
But I guess you probably have been briefed.

83
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,951
We've traced a large sum of money

84
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:19,269
From an offshore ring account
into a civilian account.

85
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,538
I want to know why.

86
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:22,640
What's the money for?

87
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,076
The civilian's name is manoosh depak.

88
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:26,711
Trained as a computer engineer,

89
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,629
Dropped out of mit after his freshman year.

90
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:30,815
Classic geek tragedy.

91
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:31,949
Sound familiar?

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,385
We sent a virus that destroyed the cpu

93
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:37,154
Of his custom computer and
bought up every series eight cpu

94
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,289
Within 30 miles.

95
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,258
He'll come into the buy more to replace it.

96
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,644
<i>Develop him as an asset,
agent bartowski.</i>

97
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,180
Find out what he's doing for the ring.

98
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:49,984
That's it? That's the whole... Mission?

99
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,802
I'll have it done by lunch.

100
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,187
Don't get cocky, bartowski.

101
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:54,906
<i>One mish does not an agent make.</i>

102
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,324
Chuck, you-you can't take this lightly.

103
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,408
Developing an asset

104
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:58,993
Is very tricky business.

105
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,446
You need to insinuate
yourself into their life

106
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:03,031
And have them trust you completely,

107
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:06,084
Knowing that one day you're
probably gonna have to burn them.

108
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:08,786
The trick is to find the hole in their life

109
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:09,837
And fill it.

110
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:11,172
With this manoosh loser,

111
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:13,124
He's a loner, friendless.

112
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,760
And the asset has entered the store.

113
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:17,795
Showtime, bartowski.

114
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,130
Don't worry, guys.

115
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:21,349
Piece of cake.

116
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,019
"mish."

117
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:29,107
<i>Chuck's not ready for an asset.</i>

118
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,276
We're advancing him too quickly.

119
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:32,527
I'm worried.

120
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:34,545
Your job's not to worry, it's to train.

121
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:35,613
Three o'clock.

122
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,682
He's with the newest buy moron.

123
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:41,352
Can I help you, sir?

124
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:42,353
Chuck, I got it.

125
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:43,488
No, really, let me help.

126
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:45,039
She's new here, still in training.

127
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:46,291
Actually, I'd rather have her help me.

128
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:47,492
No, chuck, I'm ready.

129
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:48,993
I can handle a simple sale. It's okay.

130
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,212
Hannah, no sales are simple.

131
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:52,864
But don't worry, you will get your chance

132
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,399
To shine as soon as you

133
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,633
Are ready.

134
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:56,918
Okay.

135
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:00,888
Ah, sorry about that.

136
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:02,390
Alone at last.

137
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,309
What can I do you for?

138
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,543
Nothing.

139
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:07,412
Now that you ruined my
flow with that hottie.

140
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,880
Let me ring you up personally.

141
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,899
Uh, are you from around here?
Is that a burbankian

142
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:13,718
Accent I detect?

143
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:14,736
Woodland hills.

144
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,354
See? I knew I heard

145
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,523
The familiar twang of
the san fernando valley.

146
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,658
Your eyes are hypnotic. Chestnut? Hazel?

147
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,660
Get a room, bartowski.
You're not asking him out

148
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:23,911
On a date. You know,

149
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:25,613
I think I'll just get
the cpu somewhere else.

150
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:28,199
Wait, wait, wait! No, no. Uh...

151
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:29,834
You-you should just take it,
you should take it.

152
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,035
What do you mean?

153
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,253
It's on the house,

154
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:33,904
For the inconvenience
earlier with the hottie.

155
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:35,873
You sure? I mean... Isn't that illegal?

156
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:37,175
It's on me. My pleasure.

157
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,910
Chuck, ease up
-- you're coming on a little strong.

158
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:42,547
Here's my card, just in case you
have any other computer problems,

159
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,432
Or if you want to chat, you know,

160
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:45,550
Rap a little.

161
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,185
Thanks.

162
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:48,720
Idiot.

163
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:50,388
I'm not trying to pressure you, you know.

164
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,440
No biggie. You have my card.
If you call, you call.

165
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:55,693
It's okay! Keep going!

166
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:56,561
I'll hold them off!

167
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:57,528
Call me!

168
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:58,563
I stand corrected.

169
00:05:58,614 --> 00:05:59,614
He's not ready.

170
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,866
Thank you.

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,306
You've been really jittery lately.

184
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,825
Ever since the generalissimo's party,

185
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,993
You haven't been acting like yourself.

186
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:00,746
Well... I just haven't been sleeping lately.

187
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:02,581
Nothing to worry about.

188
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,983
You don't rock climb anymore,
you never work out.

189
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:07,536
You just... Lay around and watch tv all day.

190
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:09,321
It's like I'm married to morgan.

191
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,340
I pulled a hammie, I'll have you know.

192
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:13,325
I'll be back on the bike in no time.

193
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:14,844
Can I ask you a question

194
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:15,995
About chuck?

195
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,329
Ai!

196
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,163
Oh!

197
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:19,164
Yeah. Um,

198
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:20,549
But he's your brother.

199
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,269
I mean, can't imagine I can
tell you anything about him.

200
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:24,353
Well, did you know

201
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:25,805
He went to paris last week?

202
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,807
I found this claim ticket

203
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:29,508
For charles de gaulle
airport in his luggage.

204
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:33,045
Yeah, yeah, uh, he mentioned it.

205
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:34,396
Mentioned it?

206
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,348
Why wouldn't he say anything to me?

207
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,350
He's always wanted to go to paris.

208
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:39,518
Did he see the eiffel tower?

209
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:40,686
Yeah, he did.

210
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,121
No, he didn't.

211
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:43,289
I don't know.

212
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:44,990
Damn it, I am late for my rounds.

213
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,958
Got to run.

214
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,209
No, devon, wait a minute.

215
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:48,544
There's something you're not telling me.

216
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:49,712
What's going on?

217
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:52,865
Going on? What, like a conspiracy?

218
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,032
You're freaking, babe.

219
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:55,868
You are hiding something! What is it?

220
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,670
That I love you.

221
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,754
Which I'm not hiding.

222
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,038
Let's talk about this later.

223
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,508
There are kidneys failing as we speak.

224
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,542
Devon...

225
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:05,311
De...

226
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,150
<i>What are you doing Friday?</i>

227
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,068
You want to hang in my van?

228
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:14,987
What about Thursday? And I'm disease-free.

229
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:17,523
I don't think mr.
Barnes here can say the same.

230
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,191
That was low. All's fair, kiddo.

231
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:22,194
Yeah, I think that I'm pretty
booked up this week, you guys.

232
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,446
Hannah, hannah,
could I see you for a second?

233
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,449
Remember what I said: Me, safe;
everyone else, very, very dangerous.

234
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:30,736
So, how'd you like to start phase
one of the bartowski tutorial?

235
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,254
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

236
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,505
Yogurt time.

237
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,073
Most important meal of the day.

238
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,876
Uh, we'll talk later.
What about the tutorial?

239
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,961
Lesson number one: Never work hungry.

240
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:41,463
"very dangerous," huh?

241
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:44,082
Morgan, buddy, hey,
can I talk to you for a second?

242
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,101
Yeah. Would you mind
keeping an eye on hannah?

243
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:47,519
The vultures are circling.

244
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:48,888
Oh, boy. Sure.

245
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,923
Lester, jeff.

246
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,474
What, now? Can I see you both

247
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,777
In my office, please?

248
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:56,195
You have an office?

249
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:58,263
There we go.

250
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,867
What happened to all the brooms and bleach?

251
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:05,204
I just, uh,  move 'em in
and out every morning.

252
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,956
Gentlemen,

253
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,958
Have a seat, please.

254
00:09:13,463 --> 00:09:16,215
Okay. It is my duty as assistant manager

255
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,784
To tell you there'll be no
dating in the workplace.

256
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:20,552
Yeah? You dated anna.

257
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,388
It's my constitutional right to fornicate.

258
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:24,256
Okay.

259
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:27,259
Here's the thing.

260
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,761
I like her.

261
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:30,596
Okay? I'm just asking you guys

262
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,481
To, you know, lay off.

263
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:33,866
Fine, but I get to sleep over

264
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,301
With you and chuck twice a week.

265
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,987
Okay.

266
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,271
You?

267
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,689
Next hire...

268
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:42,574
I want you to find me a wife.

269
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,910
A woman of color,

270
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:46,311
Preferably padma lakshmi.

271
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:48,280
Done.

272
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,448
One condition.

273
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,166
You men are both excellent stalkers.

274
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:53,085
I need you to use your skill
set and find out everything

275
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:54,286
There is to know about hannah, okay?

276
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:56,505
Likes, dislikes...

277
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,057
Everything.

278
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,708
Consider her stalked.

279
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,295
Okay, credit card charges,

280
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:05,097
Mostly video games, comic books.

281
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:07,132
Phone records indicate only one female call

282
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,517
In the last year-- sister.

283
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,136
I feel so sorry for this gu
y- he seems so lonely.

284
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:13,138
Oh, whoops.

285
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,640
That's your old file, bartowski.

286
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,642
Sorry about that.

287
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,977
Ah, here we go.

288
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:19,194
Oddly similar.

289
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,780
<i>Battlestar galactica, dune,</i>

290
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,983
Nacho sampler-- sounds like your dream date.

291
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,735
The problem was, chuck,
that you came on too strong.

292
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,204
You never want to seem like
you're making advances.

293
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:31,056
You always want the other person to feel

294
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:32,624
Like they're in control. Here.

295
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,710
Thank you. So, uh, that first day

296
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,212
You came into the buy more,
when we first met,

297
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:40,132
What did they tell you about me?
What do you think?

298
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,750
You hadn't had a date in over a year,

299
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,419
And they don't waste the
blondes on just anyone.

300
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:44,837
Uh, it hadn't been a year.

301
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:45,888
Okay? Thanks.

302
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:48,891
They thought you and I could connect.

303
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:51,226
I remember you left me your card so I could

304
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:53,045
Call you so we could go out.

305
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:55,547
Felt like I was having the
luckiest day of my life.

306
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,566
god, I was pathetic.

307
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,053
No, you were sweet and innocent.
I liked you.

308
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:05,557
It made it much harder.

309
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,942
Why?

310
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:10,029
Hey, sap's on his way to the bar. Let's go.

311
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:18,754
¶ ¶

312
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:23,509
<i>Wow. The last man. Incredible book.</i>

313
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:26,245
The greatest literary
achievement of our generation.

314
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:29,448
Hey, you're that guy

315
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:30,682
From the store today.

316
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:34,219
Oh, yeah.

317
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,421
Sorry about that. We had a bet
going to see who could get

318
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:38,107
A customer to steal
something from the store.

319
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,308
I won.

320
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,927
I knew it. Something like that had to be

321
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:44,429
Going on in order for that hot
chick to want to wait on me.

322
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:46,615
You don't need a 160 iq to figure that out.

323
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,067
Boost his ego, chuck.

324
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:52,204
She, uh, probably liked you.

325
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,272
No way.

326
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:55,707
The usual.

327
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,110
We're all out of the nacho
sampler tonight, manoosh.

328
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:01,296
Last one is right there.

329
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,082
We stole all the guac from the kitchen.

330
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:07,152
Remember, the nacho sampler
is his favorite dish.

331
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:12,724
Go ahead. Help yourself.

332
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,027
Thanks, um...

333
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:17,129
Chuck.

334
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,465
Can I buy you a beer, chuck?

335
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:23,135
All right, here we go.
What'd you find out about hannah?

336
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:27,439
Um, she is out of your league.

337
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,975
She's a sophisticated, classy kind of broad.

338
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:31,443
Yeah. She eats sushi...

339
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,478
With chopsticks and without the rice.

340
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,646
Wow.

341
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,181
I copied her itunes and iphone playlists.

342
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,951
She listens to classical music.

343
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:41,420
<i>Oh, boy. Tchaikovsky's swan
lake is her most-played,</i>

344
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,505
And she likes french cinema.

345
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,324
And foreign films.

346
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:47,325
Sorry, my friend,

347
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:49,128
Even with us spying on her,

348
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:50,629
You do not stand a chance.

349
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:53,849
¶ ¶

350
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,517
You're doing good. Keep it personal.

351
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:57,603
Anyway, so my dad was a physicist, right,

352
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,106
But he cracked, so when I saw
myself going down that same road,

353
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:03,442
I quit, dropped out of stanford.

354
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:04,726
That's exactly what happened to me,

355
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,945
Except I dropped out of mit.

356
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,198
Huh. I knew I could tell
a fellow underachieving,

357
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:11,016
Underappreciated man of intellect.

358
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,852
Great, two geeks in a pod.

359
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:17,539
What are you suggesting?
That buy more is not an

360
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:18,707
Impressive enough career choice?

361
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,525
It's okay.

362
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:22,828
All the doubters will be sorry soon enough.

363
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,464
They don't understand guys like us.

364
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,466
I got something big planned.

365
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,885
This is it. Move in.

366
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,703
Gently, chuck. Don't push him.

367
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,138
Uh, how, how so?

368
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:34,973
What are you, uh, what are you working on?

369
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:38,810
Work-- won't leave me alone.

370
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,846
Hello.

371
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:43,315
Guys, he's got a ring phone.

372
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:44,650
I'll run a trace.

373
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,902
Whoa, slow down, chief.

374
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,570
Yes, I have the prototype.

375
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:51,073
Still have some kinks to work out.

376
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:54,576
Look, I gotta go. I'm with a friend.

377
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:55,994
Sorry about that.

378
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:57,729
These guys, they're a little high-strung.

379
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,730
Yeah.

380
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,165
Act all tough, you know?

381
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,668
Think they're intimidating
with their secret phones.

382
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,536
Ooh... Scary.

383
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:09,258
Signal just bounced back three miles away.

384
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:10,909
Ring's tracking him. We got about five

385
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,294
Minutes before they get here, tops.

386
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:14,513
Time to send in a pro. You're up, walker.

387
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,681
So, you were talking

388
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:16,748
About your job?

389
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,917
I'm doing something weapons-related.

390
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:22,354
But that's really all I can say.

391
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,973
I want to tell you, believe me, I do.

392
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:30,262
¶ ¶

393
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,436
What the hell is she doing in here?

394
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,771
I got this!

395
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:42,291
You weren't moving fast enough.
Had to send in a closer.

396
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,625
The ring will be here any minute.

397
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,712
That hot chick just smiled at me.

398
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,280
Oh, my gosh, she's coming
over here. What do I do?

399
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,415
Just, just play it cool.
Let her come to you.

400
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:51,750
Is this what cool people do?

401
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:55,637
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, you know,
kinda... Put out the vibe.

402
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,556
Make a move, walker. We're wasting time.

403
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:00,642
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

404
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:01,977
Help him out, chuck.

405
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:02,978
Uh..

406
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:04,229
No, it's not. It's not taken.

407
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:06,982
He was actually saving
it for you, I believe.

408
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,984
Thank you.

409
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:10,986
Sarah.

410
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,104
Manoosh.

411
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,241
The ring's here.

412
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,193
Get him out back now!

413
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,162
Manoosh, come here.

414
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:21,079
Where?

415
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:22,998
Closer.

416
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,501
You got something on your lip.

417
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:27,953
Let me take it off.

418
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,498
You get him. I'm gonna get the briefcase.

419
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,666
They're heading in! Hurry up!

420
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,335
I want him alive.

421
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:44,336
Looks like our friend

422
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,605
Manoosh here had one too many.

423
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:00,152
Wow, this is the best night of my life.

424
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:01,620
Nice job, walker.

425
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,372
Another geek bites the dust.

426
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,266
Wake up, baby.

427
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,268
Hi.

428
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,038
Where am I?

429
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,490
My bedroom. What, you don't remember?

430
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:34,711
Guess you had one too many drinks, loverboy.

431
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:37,080
Did we... You know?

432
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,115
Yes, and it was amazing.

433
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:43,803
Oh! It was so intense,
we both just passed out.

434
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:45,388
I've never even spoken to a woman

435
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:47,423
As beautiful as you before.

436
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,791
Why'd you choose me?

437
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,561
Because there's something
just so mysterious about you

438
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:53,062
And sexy.

439
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,648
And you were telling me
about your top secret work,

440
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,268
And secrets turn me on...

441
00:16:58,335 --> 00:16:59,852
It's a weapon!

442
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,604
A new technology that'll change everything.

443
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,605
Tell me more.

444
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay, but first,

445
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:07,160
I don't really remember
much from last night.

446
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:10,146
Can we do it again so I'll never forget?

447
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,265
Guys, this isn't working.

448
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,683
Is he gonna be okay?

449
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:31,801
'cause that's, like, the fifth

450
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:32,885
Tranq dart that he's taken.

451
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,304
How many can a normal person handle?

452
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:36,306
As many as it takes for him to tell us

453
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:38,308
What he's building for the ring.
They're "twilight" tranqs, chuck.

454
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,442
They don't do permanent damage.

455
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:41,177
They just make you forget what happened

456
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,545
In the last five minutes.

457
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:43,780
Well, he's my asset.

458
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:44,847
I should've handled this.

459
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,488
Looks like he's ready for round six...

460
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,458
Whoa-whoa, take it easy, tranqenstein.

461
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,551
Hello.

462
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:07,253
Chuck, it's manoosh.

463
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,339
Hey, manizzle. How you doing, buddy?

464
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,390
How was last night?

465
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:11,841
I can't really remember, but judging

466
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,243
By the fact that I'm hal
f-naked in her bedroom right now,

467
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:15,212
I've gotta say you are singlehandedly

468
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,596
The best wingman in the world!

469
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,431
Well, thanks, buddy. What can I say?

470
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,100
I do have my skill sets.

471
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,985
Listen, um, you didn't happen
to come across a briefcase

472
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:23,220
At the mexican restaurant, did you?

473
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:24,654
My entire life's work's in there.

474
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:25,655
Kinda freaking out.

475
00:18:25,723 --> 00:18:26,857
No, no, no, no,

476
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:29,392
Your wingman saw that
you left said briefcase

477
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,077
And picked it up for you.

478
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:33,229
Oh, thank you, chuck.
Look, I've got a flight to catch.

479
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,282
Do you think you can meet me at the buy more

480
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,399
In about a half an hour?

481
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:37,918
Half hour? Not a problem.

482
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:40,170
Great. Thanks.

483
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:42,622
Sarah...

484
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:44,875
You in there?

485
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:49,296
Oh...

486
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,050
No, no, no!

487
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:55,418
Langley said don't open it.

488
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,720
They're sending their own hazmat team.

489
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,104
But we don't have time to wait, casey.

490
00:18:58,189 --> 00:18:59,773
Get your hand off of that.

491
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:05,762
Hmm, comic book, glasses, shirt...

492
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,780
Bingo.

493
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:13,770
Guys, I'm not flashing.

494
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,289
Whatever it is, it's not in the intersect.

495
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,908
Oh!

496
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,942
Easy, bartowski.

497
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,493
We don't know what this is.

498
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,045
You think it could be a bomb?

499
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:23,279
I don't know.

500
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,115
But we're not gonna find out the hard way.

501
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,618
Okay, just meet manoosh at
the buy more, and give him

502
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,154
Back the briefcase,
and act like nothing happened.

503
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:33,723
Wait. What? Don't we need to replace
it or something before we do that?

504
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,009
I mean, imagine what the
ring is gonna do to him

505
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,844
If they find out he doesn't have it!

506
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,462
Just don't think about it, chuck.

507
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,465
It makes being a spy a lot easier.

508
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:53,660
Dude, dude, I am freaking out.

509
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:54,978
What? Come here. Come here.

510
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,480
Ellie found a baggage ticket
from your paris mission.

511
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,667
I didn't know what to say,
so I told her you were on a work trip.

512
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:04,170
I can't do this anymore. I cannot lie to
my wife. I have to tell her the truth.

513
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,456
Look, you need to calm down, okay?

514
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:07,707
You cannot tell her

515
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:08,892
Anything.

516
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,493
I don't think you realize the gravity

517
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,829
Of the situation that you are in,

518
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,863
But you know my secret,

519
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:15,498
And there are strings attached to that.

520
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,566
What strings?

521
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:17,884
If ellie finds out,

522
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:19,302
Your lives are never gonna be the same.

523
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,503
They're gonna stick you
both in witness protection,

524
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:23,189
And I don't think that you want that.

525
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:24,441
Look, buddy, I understand that the lying

526
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:26,409
Is very difficult at this point right now,

527
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:29,729
But trust me, it gets easier.

528
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,366
Get down! Get down!

529
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:38,354
Hey, hey, ellie.

530
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,522
Hi. Um...

531
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:40,523
What's going on?

532
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,025
Chuck, look, I know that we're older,

533
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,077
And we don't have to tell each other

534
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,497
Everything, but I found out about paris.

535
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,716
And I just... I don't know.

536
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,836
When did we start keeping
secrets from each other?

537
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:55,805
Well, the thing is I was,
I was gonna tell you.

538
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:57,090
Um, it was a business trip.

539
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,576
This very eccentric customer
came into the buy more

540
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:01,394
And insisted that I do
a home theatre install

541
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,263
In his flat in paris.

542
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,781
So why keep that from me?

543
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,883
Well, because I did such a good job,

544
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:10,186
He said I could use his
flat for free for a week.

545
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:12,355
And I figured, well, you know,

546
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:14,240
Maybe you and devon could
use a proper honeymoon.

547
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,526
And I wanted it to be a surprise.

548
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:17,577
Are you serious?

549
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:19,062
Yeah. Chuck, that is

550
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:20,563
The sweetest thing!

551
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,365
Oh, I'm sorry.

552
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,901
I'm sorry that I thought you
were keeping secrets from me.

553
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:27,787
Told ya he's ready. Kid's a good liar.

554
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:30,123
You taught him well, walker.

555
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:34,210
Please, ellie, brother-sister,
there are no secrets between us.

556
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:35,545
Thank you. Bye.

557
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:39,683
Bro, that was so cold-blooded.

558
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,918
How could you just lie to her like that?

559
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:44,554
Ellie and I aren't kids anymore, all right?

560
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,857
There are some things she's
better off not knowing.

561
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,945
Manizzle.

562
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:55,398
Thanks, chuck.

563
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:56,866
You are a lifesaver.

564
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,401
Hey, what are friends for, right?

565
00:21:58,452 --> 00:21:59,936
We are friends, aren't we?

566
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:03,573
Well, when I get back from this trip,
I am going to be rich.

567
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:05,441
And then I'll start a company of my own,

568
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,610
And then we can work together.

569
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,081
Don't worry, I won't forget you.

570
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:12,966
Hello. No, I told you,

571
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,251
I'm still working the kinks out.

572
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,920
Calm down.

573
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,788
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

574
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,591
Who was that?

575
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,510
The putzes who hired me.
You know, I found out they're

576
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,311
Paying me peanuts compared
to what I can get on

577
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:26,980
The open market. But I'm no fool.

578
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:28,598
Anyway...

579
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:29,966
Thanks, buddy.

580
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,901
Wait, wait, wait.

581
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,737
Um, uh...

582
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:36,139
Before you go, let me get you some yogurt.

583
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,858
Because, you know, you can't
travel on an empty stomach.

584
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:40,476
So stay here. I'll be right back.

585
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:41,978
Okay, all right.

586
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,949
Not picking up any sign of ordnance.

587
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,250
Definitely not a bomb.

588
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,319
Guys, guys, we need to help manoosh, okay?

589
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:52,505
The ring's gonna track him down,
and if he doesn't

590
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,591
Give that thing back to them,
they're gonna hurt him or worse.

591
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:55,625
Cry me a river.

592
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,260
He's building a weapon.

593
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:58,327
He's no innocent.

594
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:03,349
He's served his purpose.
That's what an asset is.

595
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,503
Conduit to information, nothing more.

596
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:14,177
No more ducking us, manoosh.

597
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:15,528
Take us to your lab.

598
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,147
We want our weapon.

599
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,148
Wait, wait, wait.

600
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:20,349
Found something.

601
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:26,389
What is that?

602
00:23:26,457 --> 00:23:27,874
Anthrax? Agent orange?

603
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:28,875
Okay, guys, fine.

604
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,543
Just, uh...

605
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:32,745
Just let me put my shades on real quick.

606
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,164
It's really bright out.

607
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:37,333
U.V. Protection-- very important these days.

608
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,889
Shaving cream.

609
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:44,140
It was a decoy.

610
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,642
Then where is the weapon?

611
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,310
They found manoosh.

612
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:49,846
He doesn't know who he's dealing with.
They're gonna kill him.

613
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,942
That's not the weapon.

614
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:38,945
Manoosh is the weapon.

615
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,116
He built a new intersect.

616
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,125
how did manoosh build an intersect?

617
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:58,328
I thought my dad was the only
one who knew how to do that.

618
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,597
Well, after 2.0 intersect was destroyed,

619
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:01,932
The ring lifted certain burnt components

620
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,817
From a cia warehouse.

621
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,152
Manoosh must have reverse engineered it.

622
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:07,070
We need to find manoosh
before the ring does.

623
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,471
He mentioned getting rich.

624
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,157
That he was going to sell
it to the highest bidder.

625
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,075
I got something.

626
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:16,279
Manoosh just used his credit
card to book a flight to dubai.

627
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,497
Why? What's in dubai?

628
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,699
Weap-con.

629
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,518
The greatest weapons
convention in the world.

630
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,704
I go every year.
I find it incredibly relaxing.

631
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,025
looks like I'll get to write this year's off

632
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,327
As a business trip.

633
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,019
Come in.

634
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,904
Hey, morgan.

635
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,557
Uh, jeff said you wanted to see me?

636
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:46,176
I did, I did, yeah. Nothing urgent.
I just wanted to see

637
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,178
How the buy more's treating you.

638
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:50,147
"swan lake."

639
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:51,531
It's my favorite.

640
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,116
Mine, too.

641
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,018
<i>Sans respirer's a classic.</i>

642
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,020
I must have seen it like ten times.

643
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,490
12. Yeah, I can't get
enough of french new wave.

644
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,491
Huh.

645
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,692
Oh, have a seat, have s seat.

646
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:05,295
It's amazing how much we have in common.

647
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:06,713
Right? Yeah.

648
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:08,732
I just-- I love international cinema.

649
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,219
It's not just the cinema,
it's the people and the culture.

650
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:13,470
Right? Uh, boy...

651
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:15,205
Sadly, too many of my
colleagues think that burbank

652
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:16,723
Is the center of the world.

653
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:18,475
Yeah, chuck had never been to paris

654
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,227
Until last week on that install.

655
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,445
Chuck went to paris?

656
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:28,318
Oh, uh, right, I forgot,
chuck told me to keep it quiet.

657
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:29,719
Everything's a little secret around here.

658
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,071
But of course, you know,

659
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:33,690
As you are the assistant manager.

660
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:35,558
Right, I am, of course, sure.

661
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,227
I know everything about chuck.

662
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,197
Well, do you mind telling me what goes on

663
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:41,615
Over at that yogurt store?

664
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,701
Because, um, um...

665
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:46,836
He is...

666
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:49,623
Okay, constantly running over there.

667
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,291
Yogurt store?

668
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,943
Yes. Uh, his ex works there.

669
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,745
He's having trouble letting go.

670
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:57,547
Um, morgan, hey, uh...

671
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:00,467
What was it that you
wanted to talk to me about?

672
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:01,801
Nothing.

673
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:10,193
Paris.

674
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,128
<i>Where else has he gone?</i>

675
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:20,070
Welcome to weap-con.

676
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:23,790
<i>Bienvenidos, bonjour,
as-salaam alaikum.</i>

677
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:32,082
Ammo can be found in the west pavilion.

678
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,167
Explosive and short-range missiles are...

679
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,809
Deadly pens. I've got
exploding pens, laser pens...

680
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:46,296
Hey! Casey, no shopping.
We're here to find manoosh.

681
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:48,181
You sir, what kind of pen do you want?

682
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,816
How much for the laser pen?

683
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,234
Behold this beauty.

684
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,303
The em-50 mobile interrogation unit.

685
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:56,156
The most exclusive one of its kind,

686
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,775
The em-50 is nearly
impossible to escape from.

687
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:00,610
You don't have time to
get a prisoner to gitmo,

688
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,279
But you need to extract vital information,

689
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,281
This is your unit.

690
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,584
The presentation on stage
four is about to begin.

691
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:09,002
Ladies...

692
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,954
Please, have a seat, get situated.

693
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:12,122
Huh?

694
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,656
Ladies, gentlemen,

695
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,658
Warlords, sheiks and huns.

696
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,327
I see some huns back there, don't I?

697
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:20,496
Welcome to the future
of warfare and weapons.

698
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:22,349
I have before me

699
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,051
The most powerful weapon known to mankind.

700
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:30,023
That weapon, you ask...

701
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:31,308
Is me!

702
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,146
At this time yesterday,
I was a pathetic weakling.

703
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,365
These bikini babes wouldn't even spit on me.

704
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,651
I have no muscle, terrible allergies

705
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:43,286
And am completely uncoordinated,

706
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,155
But...

707
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,240
Behold me now.

708
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,166
Moments ago, I was a 100-pound weakling.

709
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:59,302
Now a deadly kung fu expert.

710
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,806
Laugh if you will.

711
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:05,041
Do I have any volunteers?

712
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:06,643
Maybe one of you apes thinks

713
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,977
They can kick my ass.

714
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,182
Step back, ladies.

715
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,254
Thank you, thank you.

716
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:36,239
Imagine an entire army of men like me.

717
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,540
No training involved.

718
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:41,244
Just throw these glasses
on any civilian and voila,

719
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:42,679
An army of instant warriors.

720
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:44,580
So call your banks, your kings,

721
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:46,132
Your dignitaries or what have you,

722
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,084
'cause we're going to start
the bidding in five minutes.

723
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,686
And we're gonna kick this bad boy off

724
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:50,937
At $50 million.

725
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,689
Thank you!

726
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:06,486
Ooh, nachos.

727
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,291
He's my asset. I'll handle this.

728
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,076
Don't get soft on him, bartowski.

729
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,611
The only way any of us are safe

730
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:16,746
Is if he's under lock and key.

731
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:19,449
Well, fine. I can control him.

732
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,484
Then do it.

733
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:30,460
Chuck? What are you doing here?

734
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:35,632
I came to protect you, okay?

735
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,901
To stop you from making
a very horrible mistake.

736
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,602
I know about the glasses.

737
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,471
I know about the new intersect
that you're building.

738
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:43,072
Who are you?

739
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,109
I'm an agent with the cia.

740
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,811
So you were tracking me?

741
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:51,681
This friendship is fake?

742
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:53,867
Sarah?

743
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,168
That wasn't real either?

744
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:57,086
I'm sorry, okay?

745
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:58,171
I really am sorry.

746
00:30:58,255 --> 00:30:59,622
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings here.

747
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,176
I just... I can't let you do this.

748
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,827
These are bad people you're selling to.

749
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:07,514
Worse than a guy who pretends
to be my only friend?

750
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:08,681
Or a woman who pretends

751
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,300
To have intercourse with me?

752
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,137
The truth is, I don't need friends, chuck.

753
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:16,473
Not when I've got these.

754
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:18,525
Manoosh!

755
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:25,398
Hello, manoosh.

756
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,984
We've been looking for you.

757
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:31,154
I believe you have something of ours.

758
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:55,569
Wow. So now not only does
the ring have both manoosh,

759
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:57,621
But also the new intersect
that he's building.

760
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:58,972
That is just super.

761
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:00,674
Good thing I bought that laser pen

762
00:32:00,758 --> 00:32:01,758
From the japanese booth.

763
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:04,127
It burns through anything.

764
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:06,847
I thought sarah specifically
said no shopping.

765
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,815
Just scootch over here,
grab it with your mouth.

766
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,300
Come on. Get your mouth over here

767
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:12,769
And pull it out of my
inside pocket. Let's go.

768
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:15,105
Come on.

769
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:16,806
There we go.

770
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:18,575
Oh!

771
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:19,809
Shh! Quiet!

772
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:22,746
Right here. Okay. On the left.

773
00:32:22,814 --> 00:32:24,281
Easy. Okay, okay, okay.

774
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:26,333
Come on. Shh!

775
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:28,518
What do we--

776
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:30,420
Don't be shy. Just get in there.

777
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,041
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

778
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,158
Okay, ow, ow.

779
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,710
Easy!

780
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:37,994
Don't bite me!

781
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:38,995
I'm not biting you.

782
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:40,163
All right. You got it?

783
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:42,165
Uh-huh. Just be careful of the button.

784
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:43,467
It activates the laser.

785
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:44,968
whoa!

786
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:51,608
You aim carefully now, bartowski.

787
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:53,560
Don't you make me a eunuch.

788
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:57,948
Otherwise, I'll teach you the
meaning of "eye for an eye."

789
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:59,199
Get to work.

790
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,371
Easy.

791
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:05,822
I got it!

792
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:08,525
Shh. Give me that.

793
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:12,996
All right. Here we go.

794
00:33:13,047 --> 00:33:14,998
Here... Lasers.

795
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:22,472
Woman : Ammo can be found
in the west pavilion.

796
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,724
Explosives and short-range missiles...

797
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:26,393
Look, guys, I'll cut you a deal, huh?

798
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:27,594
Half off.

799
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,313
No, you'll give it to us.

800
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,347
We don't need you anymore.

801
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,048
Yeah?

802
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:35,552
Looks like you need me now.

803
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:37,437
So let's talk about a reasonable fee, okay?

804
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,890
Drop your guns!

805
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:44,995
Hey, folks, it sounds like we have

806
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:48,582
Another demonstration
taking place back here.

807
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:51,668
As you can see, many of our
products are ideally suited

808
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:54,070
For resolving these types
of hostage negotiations.

809
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,840
Impressive simulation.

810
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:58,925
Yeah, well, I'd rather kill him, too,

811
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,761
Than let you have him, so I guess

812
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:03,430
We're on the same page.
Looks like manoosh dies, then.

813
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,549
Manoosh is not going to die.

814
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,602
In my hand, I hold a japanese laser pen.

815
00:34:08,686 --> 00:34:10,687
Pinpoint accuracy.

816
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,389
Could shoot the wings off a fly,

817
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,775
If one was so sadistically
inclined, which I am!

818
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:16,860
Nobody drop their guns!

819
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:21,398
He won't do it. I can see it
in his eyes. He won't kill me.

820
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:25,202
Okay, fine. That's fair.
I probably won't kill you.

821
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:28,271
But I will remove the greater
part of your earlobe.

822
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:32,125
What the...?!

823
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,443
Casey, what is the de...?!

824
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:35,245
I specifically asked for
the same pen that you got.

825
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:36,413
She gave me the wrong pen.

826
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:37,614
Just like bartowski,

827
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:39,082
Bring a knife to a gun fight.

828
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,217
Now, where were we?

829
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:43,754
Oh, I know. We were going to kill you.

830
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:02,989
He's getting away.

831
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:23,493
You secure manoosh.
He cannot walk out of here

832
00:35:23,544 --> 00:35:24,795
Knowing what he knows.

833
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:29,850
Wow, chuck. That was awesome.

834
00:35:29,934 --> 00:35:32,352
Incredible, just incredible!

835
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:35,055
Well, thanks for rescuing me.
I mean, if it weren't for you,

836
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:37,107
I'd probably be in some deep,
dark cell somewhere.

837
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:39,643
Uh...

838
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,445
Speaking of which, manoosh,

839
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:42,879
I cannot let you go.

840
00:35:42,947 --> 00:35:44,698
Chuck, please.

841
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:46,450
I won't tell anybody. I promise.

842
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:48,535
No one will ever know about the intersect

843
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,036
Me, the sunglasses, anything.

844
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:51,571
I'll disappear. I swear.

845
00:35:57,862 --> 00:35:59,229
Thanks, chuck.

846
00:35:59,297 --> 00:36:01,581
I owe you my life.

847
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,308
Tour guide: Here at the
tranq gun booth, we feature

848
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,042
The latest in non-lethal suppression.

849
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:15,679
That's 50 ccs of pure-grade ether.

850
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,348
Your enemies will get plenty of rest

851
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:20,100
Before you interrogate them.

852
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:24,354
I guess bartowski doesn't have the stones.

853
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:33,997
Another fabulous demonstration.

854
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,583
I stand corrected.

855
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,603
He has to go underground.

856
00:36:46,655 --> 00:36:47,905
If the ring finds him,

857
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,573
Then he can build them another intersect.

858
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,442
It's the only way.

859
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:53,143
Do you want me to handle it?

860
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,978
Yeah.

861
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,864
Yeah, I would. Um...

862
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,049
But I have to do it.

863
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,669
Hey.

864
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,587
Hey.

865
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,339
I've been scared to death.

866
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,657
So, when are you guys going to release me?

867
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,842
I just want to go home,

868
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,494
Forget this ever happened.

869
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:14,014
You can't go home, manoosh.
We are sending you

870
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,165
To a secured isolation facility.

871
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,017
Somewhere that you will be safe.

872
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,502
But I didn't do anything wrong!

873
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:22,306
I mean, I tried to make a few bucks,
but that's not illegal!

874
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:27,528
Chuck. You have to help me!

875
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,680
I thought you were my friend.

876
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,785
I'm not.

877
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,203
I'm a spy.

878
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:40,657
Chuck.

879
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:43,377
Chuck! Please.

880
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,412
Chuck!

881
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,698
Hmm. Only one way to deal
with burning an asset.

882
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,334
Johnny walker.

883
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,086
Black.

884
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,147
Hey.

885
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,015
Where you been, another trip to paris?

886
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:06,884
Uh, dubai, actually.

887
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,185
Funny.

888
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:12,322
Or-or maybe you were at
that yogurt store again?

889
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,742
I know your ex works there.

890
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,028
Uh, hey, what about the tutorial?

891
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,396
Rule number one:

892
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,165
Never work on an empty stomach.

893
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,732
On break. Going to quickie sushi.

894
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,419
Hey. There he is.

895
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,420
Hey.

896
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,454
Can we talk for a second?

897
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,072
Uh, yeah, I'm kind of beat, morgan.

898
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,408
Oh, yeah. I can imagine. All that travel.

899
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:34,678
What, uh... What traveling?

900
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,880
Just driving around town
on all those installs.

901
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:38,248
Right, yeah.

902
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,416
It's got to be exhausting.

903
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,971
Hey, anything you want to talk to me about?

904
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,276
No. Is there anything you want to ask me?

905
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,261
No.

906
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:53,197
Okay, great. Good talk.

907
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,264
Absolutely. One of our best.

908
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,068
Yo.

909
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,787
How'd it go last night, stallion?

910
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,040
You take her to pound town?

911
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,242
Ooh, can I get an address on that?

912
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:07,628
Actually, I need a little more
research done here, fellas.

913
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,996
Hmm.

914
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,631
I told you, we still need to study

915
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,616
Her sleeping patterns.

916
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,085
Oh, no. Not-not research on hannah.

917
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,137
Research on chuck.

918
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,476
¶ ¶

919
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,894
Finally.

920
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:27,064
Honey, the tickets that chuck
got us to paris are here.

921
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,132
First class!

922
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,136
I don't think we should go.

923
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:35,639
What? They're free tickets.

924
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,324
No, they're not.

925
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,610
Nothing is free.

926
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:41,778
Those have strings attached.

927
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,580
What strings? They're from chuck.

928
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:44,781
What are you talking about?

929
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,166
He...

930
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,536
You...

931
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,339
You have to obey me.

932
00:39:53,675 --> 00:39:54,958
Yeah, I think that was in our vows.

933
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,711
I am the husband,
and I forbid us to go to paris.

934
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,681
That's it!

935
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,968
Oh, hey, morgan.

936
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:07,354
You forbid us?! Are you kidding me, devon?

937
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,523
Ellie, hey. Is everything okay?

938
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,341
No, I think that there's
something weird going on

939
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:12,359
With chuck and devon.

940
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,777
It's like they're... I don't know.

941
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,229
They're keeping this secret from me.

942
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,682
Um...

943
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:20,067
Okay.

944
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,369
Are you suggesting chuck is
caught in a big, giant web

945
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,154
Of conspiracy and-and deception?

946
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:27,541
I know. I know when you put it like that,

947
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,692
It sounds ridiculous.

948
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,694
Because I couldn't agree more!

949
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:32,863
All right, I've been thinking
about this for months.

950
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,082
Finally, someone with some common sense.

951
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,935
Morgan, we have to figure
out what's going on.

952
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,054
Don't worry about it.
I got my best men on it.

953
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:44,808
¶ ¶

954
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,283
¶ ¶

955
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,077
Our boy's growing up, huh?

956
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,411
When we first met him,

957
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:23,847
You ever think he'd be
able to burn an asset?

958
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,082
No.

959
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:28,769
Well, he's turning into a spy.

960
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,854
That's a good thing.

961
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,859
Is it?

962
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:41,732
So you think this kid's got the intersect?

963
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:42,899
That's right, agent walker.

964
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:44,701
He's connected to bryce larkin.

965
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:45,736
Weaknesses?

966
00:41:45,787 --> 00:41:47,120
Bright, but an underachiever.

967
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,489
Lonely. Had his heart broken recently.

968
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,959
I'm downloading his picture now.

969
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,136
Piece of cake.

970
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,222
¶ who's that? Vicki vale,
vicki vale, vic-vicki vale. ¶
