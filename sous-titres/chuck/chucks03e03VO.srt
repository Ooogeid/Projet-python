1
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,241
Let's jump right in.

2
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:09,142
Who would like to help
me dissect the branches

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,110
of the femoral artery?

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,575
Anyone?

5
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:14,049
No one?

6
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:16,211
Fine.

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:18,359
How about, uh, Mr. Woodcomb?

8
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:20,060
Devon?

9
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,284
Devon?

10
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:24,240
Seems Devon has more pressing concerns

11
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:26,528
on his first day of medical school.

12
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:29,556
So perhaps, uh, Ms. Eleanor Bartowski

13
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:32,146
would like to give me a hand, hmm?

14
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,717
Well, wherever Mr.
Woodcomb and Ms. Bartowski are,

15
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:40,970
I hope they're gaining an
appreciation of the human body.

16
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:43,921
* *

17
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:49,222
What did you say your name was? Devon.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,662
Yours? Ellie.

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,640
Pleasure to meet you, Ellie.

20
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:55,780
You know, I don't normally
make out with strangers

21
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,081
in broom closets like this.

22
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,167
We're not strangers.

23
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,339
Remember?

24
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:03,282
I'm Devon, you're Ellie.

25
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,779
Oh, God, I love med school.

26
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:15,954
Broom! Broom! Broom!

27
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,136
Have you seen the broom?

28
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,740
Can you forget about the TV?

29
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,646
I just broke another one
of our wedding plates.

30
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:23,916
I can do this.

31
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,555
I just have to channel my inner Chuck.

32
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:26,725
Chuck who?

33
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,764
That person's dead to me.

34
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,136
Relax, babe, I have nine years

35
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:31,673
of post-graduate education.

36
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,812
I can figure out a stupid TV set.

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,217
You know, he said he was gonna help us move.

38
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:36,253
No excuses.

39
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,024
Well, honey, you remember how it is.

40
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:39,929
He's young, fancy-free.

41
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,804
Probably just slipped his mind.

42
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:46,246
Honey,

43
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,683
look at this.

44
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,855
This is our wedding album.

45
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,960
Is it just me or does this

46
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,731
feel like a million years ago?

47
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:58,577
What happened to us?

48
00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:01,284
Well, we moved.

49
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,255
We went back to work.

50
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,591
Real life happened.

51
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,632
Well, when do we get to
take a break from real life?

52
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:10,838
When do we get to be these people again?

53
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:14,213
Okay, here's the deal.

54
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:16,485
Enough moving for one night.

55
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,656
I'm gonna get us some real food,

56
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:19,892
we're gonna sit on this couch

57
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,429
and we're gonna watch our wedding video.

58
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:23,533
And then maybe later

59
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,470
we can recreate our wedding night.

60
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,013
What about the TV?

61
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,854
That's a job for a professional.

62
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:36,360
Is it just me or has there been

63
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:38,497
like a lot of helicopters lately?

64
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,868
Hmm.

65
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:42,839
Hadn't noticed.

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,887
Sorry, dude.

67
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,157
Didn't mean to scare you.

68
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:54,629
Really?

69
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,299
Well, then maybe you shouldn't be

70
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,838
sneaking into my room in
the middle of the night.

71
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,241
Well, then maybe you should tell your pilot

72
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:01,577
to land a little farther from the apartment.

73
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:04,113
Oh, right.

74
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,282
Sorry about that.

75
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,885
The thing is,

76
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,626
he doesn't really know the
Echo Park area all that well.

77
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:13,866
But, uh, we'll work on that.

78
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,135
Hey, can you, uh, do me a favor

79
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,771
and help me get out of
this thing right here?

80
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,939
Just pull down on the...

81
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,775
Where were you tonight?

82
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,744
You told Ellie that you were
gonna help us out with the TV.

83
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:23,546
She's a little pissed, bro.

84
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:26,252
Oh, man, my bad.

85
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,322
I had a, uh, CIA mission.

86
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,392
What exactly does that mean?

87
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,297
Well, you know, same old, same old.

88
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,999
Bad guy throws a fancy cocktail party.

89
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,168
Another bad guy's

90
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:37,504
trying to sell him a weapon.

91
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,374
We bust both bad guys, diffuse a bomb.

92
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:41,610
Blah, blah, blah.

93
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,914
That sounds kind of kickass.

94
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,984
What do you got under there?

95
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:47,320
Body armor.

96
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:50,124
You might want to leave
that on when you come over.

97
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:52,060
Like I said, your sister's about to blow.

98
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:55,800
All right.

99
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,105
Chuck, you could've been a
surgeon with those hands.

100
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,275
He could've been a lot of things.

101
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,543
I would settle for being on time.

102
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:06,484
That should do it.

103
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:08,052
Try it now.

104
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:11,055
It has been reported,

105
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:13,123
Premier Alejandro Goya
collapsed shortly after...

106
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:14,824
Oh, oh, look at that.

107
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,592
I take it back, you're a genius.

108
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,927
I'm gonna get the wedding DVD.

109
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:19,995
This visit to the U.S. is the first

110
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:22,698
for the outspoken Costa Gravan leader.

111
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,633
Goya has ruled his small nation

112
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:28,403
ever since a Communist coup in 1974.

113
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,745
Speaking of collapsing, Chuck, you okay?

114
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,242
Huh, what?

115
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,176
Yes, yeah.

116
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,741
I'm fine; I'm a little light-headed.

117
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,342
That's all.

118
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:50,977
I gotta run.

119
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,745
What is it? Another mission?

120
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:53,880
Huh, something with Premier?

121
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,283
You know, I'm sorry, buddy,

122
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:57,318
it's spy stuff; it's confidential.

123
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:02,888
Where are you going?

124
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,989
Sorry, buddy, doctor stuff.

125
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,523
Confidential. Hmm.

126
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:08,258
Hey!

127
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:10,728
What happened to recreating
our wedding night?

128
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:12,231
Sorry, babe. Duty calls.

129
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,566
I will make it up to you, I promise.

130
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:21,604
The Costa Gravan premier is
listed in critical condition.

131
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,906
Outstanding. Want me to crack the bubbly?

132
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:26,075
No. I want you to go to the hospital

133
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,043
and guard against further
threats to his life,

134
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:29,177
natural or otherwise.

135
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,845
But haven't you personally

136
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,281
given me the order to
kill that commie crackpot

137
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:34,749
on three separate occasions?

138
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:38,185
And three times, you have
failed to complete your orders.

139
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:39,786
I thought you said you had a perfect record.

140
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:44,223
Wow. This is getting
entertainingly uncomfortable.

141
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,558
Our relations with Costa
Gravas have changed, Colonel.

142
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:50,061
The premier is here to announce
plans to open his nation up

143
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:51,396
to democratic elections.

144
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:52,663
Oh, and you believe that?

145
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,198
Our duty is to stop anyone

146
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,700
who would stop him from
going through with his plan.

147
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:57,868
Understood?

148
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,236
Yes, ma'am. SARAH: So,

149
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:01,104
we're assuming this was
an assassination attempt?

150
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,305
We're not assuming anything

151
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:03,773
until we've secured his medical records.

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,240
That brings me to your assignment.

153
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:08,243
The premier is being treated at...

154
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,511
Let me guess.

155
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,712
Westside Medical?

156
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,913
Correct.

157
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,223
...he's stable.

158
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:29,727
Everybody relax. The doctor's here.

159
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:32,629
<i>General, are you suggesting
that I exploit</i>

160
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:34,097
my sister and/or brother-in-law

161
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:37,333
to acquire confidential medical
records for governmental use?

162
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,135
Yes, Chuck, that's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

163
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:41,469
I knew it. I was on...

164
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:43,137
Wait. Hold on a second, General.

165
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:44,639
If anything happens to the premier,

166
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,874
I'm holding you responsible.

167
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:51,979
If anything happens to this man,

168
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:55,414
I'm holding you responsible.

In a miraculous turn of events,

177
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:37,682
the Costa Gravan premier is
being released from the hospital

178
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,317
just hours after being
rushed to the emergency room.

179
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:42,152
Right now, we go to Westside Medical

180
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,021
for a live press conference.

181
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,855
Dr. Woodcomb? REPORTER 2: Dr. Woodcomb?

182
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,056
REPORTER 3: It was reported

183
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,457
that the premier suffered heart failure.

184
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,025
How do you account for his amazing recovery?

185
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,460
I can only say this.

186
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:54,196
The premier is an amazing man,
a real fighter.

187
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:55,297
I'm gonna be sick.

188
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:56,498
Dr. Woodcomb? Dr. Woodcomb?

189
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:57,699
<i>Â¿Cuales son la probabilidades</i>

190
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,400
<i>del premier volviendo al trabajo?</i>

191
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:02,570
What is the probability of the
premier returning to work?

192
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:04,539
<i>Hmm. Las probabilidades</i>

193
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:06,640
<i>de que se reincorporan al trabajo</i>

194
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,342
<i>es muy Awesome.</i>

195
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,011
Is there anything your brothe
r-in-law can't do?

196
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,213
Well, thus the nickname.

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,381
Okay, enough sitting around.

198
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:16,815
We need to figure out what really happened

199
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,083
to the premier.

200
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:19,251
Let's go apprehend the good doctor,

201
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:20,485
get those medical records out of him.

202
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:22,853
Nobody is apprehending anybody.

203
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,253
He's family. I can talk to him.

204
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,090
Just remember, Chuck,
he's a civilian, so be cool.

205
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,058
Hello.

206
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,266
Sorry, bro. Didn't mean to scare you.

207
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,067
You didn't.

208
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:42,702
I didn't?

209
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,736
Whatever.

210
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:49,340
Listen, there's a few
questions I need to ask you.

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,408
It's about the premier, right?

212
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:56,213
Sure you want to talk about this here, hmm?

213
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,015
Doesn't the CIA want to
debrief me or something?

214
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,217
<i>I am debriefing you.</i>

215
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:02,618
That's what I'm doing

216
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,253
right now. This is a debriefing.

217
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,854
I mean, in your secret base.

218
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,424
Secret... You've watched too many movies.

219
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:09,726
Just tell me what you
know about the premier.

220
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:13,029
Well, I know he didn't
really have a heart attack.

221
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:15,031
His potassium level was off the charts.

222
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,733
I don't know how it got into his
system... So he was poisoned.

223
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,968
Okay, that's all I needed to know. Thanks.

224
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,771
Whoa, Chuck, you know,
if there's anything else I can do?

225
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,439
No. You've been great.

226
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:26,974
No. Seriously.

227
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,910
If the CIA needs an extra set of hands...

228
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:31,911
Good to know.

229
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:33,412
Chuck, you're not hearing me.

230
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,447
Okay? Nothing against married life,

231
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:37,484
but I could use some real excitement.

232
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:40,888
Devon, you're an adventure
sports cardiologist.

233
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,424
Whatever, man. I can do that in my sleep.

234
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:45,125
You know, I need some real action.

235
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:46,426
Some real adrenaline.

236
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:49,362
I want to feel like I felt out
on the football field, dude.

237
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,430
You know, I can still run a fou
r-four-40. Great.

238
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:52,865
If we ever need a tight-end,

239
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,467
you're the first call I'm making,
but until then,

240
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,235
you're my brother-in-law. Ellie...

241
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,170
would kill me.

242
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:01,906
<i>Thanks to your brother-i n-law's
intelligence, we have to assume</i>

243
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:04,274
<i>that the assassin is still in play.</i>

244
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,642
There's an event at the Costa
Gravan Consulate this evening.

245
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,077
I need your team there to guard the premier.

246
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:10,711
You want us to break in?

247
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,046
Technically, that's invading sovereign soil.

248
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,614
That is why the CIA

249
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,748
has no official knowledge of this mission.

250
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,650
Uh, just spit-balling here, General.

251
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,485
Why don't we just tell the premier

252
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,854
that his life is in danger?

253
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,021
Would you trust a country

254
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,322
that spent the better part

255
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,124
of three decades trying to kill you?

256
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,425
Hmm. Yeah.

257
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,161
Your protection must go undetected.

258
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,030
What? So, that-that's... that's it?

259
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:35,465
If we get busted, then the CIA disavows us,

260
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,100
and then we rot for the rest of our lives

261
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,302
in a Costa Gravan prison?

262
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:40,469
In Costa Gravas, the punishment

263
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:41,770
for sedition is death by firing squad.

264
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,538
Just my kind of mission.

265
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:44,973
Too bad I have to recuse myself.

266
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,742
What? He's bailing? You're bailing on us?

267
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,744
I can't show my face on Costa
Gravan soil, I'm a wanted man.

268
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,013
You know what they'd do if they knew

269
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:55,048
I was in Los Angeles?

270
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:57,583
I spilled more blood than
that Mickey Mouse revolution

271
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:59,018
than any other...

272
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,886
Don't you think you're
being a little paranoid?

273
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:05,156
<i>They call me el Angel de la Muerte.</i>

274
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:07,191
The Angel of Death. Please.

275
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,859
Bro, it was the '80s.

276
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,893
Come on.

277
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,194
You really think the premier

278
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:12,695
gives a flying crap about you,

279
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:13,796
John Casey?

280
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:16,198
Oh, no! It's the Angel of Death!

281
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,533
Hmm.

282
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,068
MAN : 11835.

283
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:23,738
Casey, those aren't...

284
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,206
Oh, boy!

285
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,440
Oh.

286
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:28,575
At last, they've come for me.

287
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,314
Can take a few of these commies with me.

288
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:36,515
Ready?

289
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,450
CHUCK No.

290
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:40,885
No, not ready. You wait just one second.

291
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:41,919
They are not here

292
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,921
for you, Casey. They're here for...

293
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:45,055
Huh?

294
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:47,891
Devon?

295
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,492
Kind of in the middle of something, babe.

296
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:54,697
Baby, I've been on call
for three straight days.

297
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,532
I know, hon. And I haven't

298
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,366
worked out since we moved in.

299
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,068
Gotta keep my heart rate in the red.

300
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,069
CHUCK: Don't open the door.

301
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,404
Okay.

302
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,405
Okay.

303
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:06,573
Pick up the phone.

304
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,941
Pick up the phone.

305
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,010
You've got to be kidding me.

306
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,249
Make it stop.

307
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:20,250
Make it stop. Okay.

308
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:22,485
I got it, babe.

309
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:31,259
Dr. Woodcomb?

310
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:34,295
Um... yeah?

311
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,763
Dr. Devon Woodcomb?

312
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,299
That's me.

313
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:39,834
Do you have any idea what you've done,

314
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:41,903
Dr. Devon Woodcomb?

315
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:46,606
You saved my life.

316
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:51,944
How can I ever hope to repay you?

317
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:56,281
Okay, how about we just keep it down?

318
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:58,183
Devon, who are these people?

319
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,151
Alejandro Fulgencio Goya.

320
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,486
I am the master of parliament,

321
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,454
chief military officer ofosta Gravas.

322
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:07,157
I am at your most humble service.

323
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,658
What is going on? You must be

324
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:10,526
SeÃ±ora Woodcomb, hmm?

325
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,461
Actually, I'm a doctor, too.

326
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,262
All right, stay put.

327
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,463
I'm going in.

328
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:17,465
You're a doctor?

329
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,301
I didn't think such beauty still exists.

330
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,770
Not from beyond the shores
of Costa Gravas, huh?

331
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,338
Well, it's nice to meet you.

332
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:27,440
How do you know Devon exactly?
You don't know?

333
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:30,576
I was going to tell you
when you woke up, honey.

334
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,777
Ah, such modesty!

335
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,946
Your husband's a hero.

336
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,315
<i>Saluden el hombre!</i>

337
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,284
I owe him my life.

338
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:44,254
There is a gala this
evening at my consulate.

339
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,856
You will be both be my guests of honor.

340
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,391
I will be humbled.

341
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,763
He's waiting for you to say yes.

342
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:56,598
Oh. Yes. Oh. Yes.

343
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,499
Splendwill see you tonight, then.

344
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,168
Hey, somebody say something about a gala?

345
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:03,770
Hi. Sorry.

346
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:04,804
Easy there. Uh,

347
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:07,073
sir, this is my brother Chuck.

348
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,007
He's your brother?

349
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:09,976
<i>Quieto.</i>

350
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,977
Ah.

351
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:13,912
The resemblance, I see.

352
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,547
Your family has such

353
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:17,382
delicate features, huh? Thank you.

354
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,684
Much more suitable on a woman, though, no?

355
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:21,085
Fair enough.

356
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,619
If he's half the man you are,

357
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,654
you bring him as well, huh?

358
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:28,557
A military escort will be here at 7:00.

359
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,927
<i>VÃ¡monos!</i>

360
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,932
Yes! I can't believe this is happening.

361
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:40,999
Wow!

362
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,101
* *

363
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:50,373
I can't believe this is happening.

364
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,375
I spent a year on secret service detail.

365
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:55,577
I'm sure I can protect
one smal l-time dictator.

366
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,713
The dictator's not who I'm
worried about, though.

367
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:02,283
Is this romantic enough for you?

368
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,352
Devon, it's perfect.

369
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,923
* *

370
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,624
Look.

371
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,392
I know you're nervous,

372
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,559
but I also know how the Intersect works

373
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:14,560
when you get nervous.

374
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:15,594
And if you really want to protect them,

375
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:17,663
you're going to have to focus.

376
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:24,768
Casey, I got guards with submachine guns

377
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,936
at both the north and west exits.

378
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:28,071
<i>Yeah, copy that.</i>

379
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:30,472
Main doors have hidden metal detectors.

380
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Someone should go around back,
check the service entrance.

381
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:35,209
I'll go check on the premier.
Rendezvous in five.

382
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:38,113
Chuck, keep a lookout for
any potential assassins.

383
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,829
So, what's the plan, bro?

384
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:58,331
CIA going to whack the premier?

385
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,733
Nobody is going to be
whacking anybody, okay?

386
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,768
That's why we're here.

387
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,769
Ah, I get it.

388
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,771
We're on the counteroffensive.

389
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,972
What's my mission?

390
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,908
Your mission?

391
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,242
Your miss-- oh, hold on a second.

392
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,276
It's Langley.

393
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,145
What are they telling me? Oh!

394
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,147
They want you to stop screwing around, okay?

395
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,316
They want you to keep
my sister out of danger.

396
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:19,151
They want you not to take
your eyes off her all night.

397
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,186
Think you you can handle that, 007?

398
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,021
Uh, Chuck...

399
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,295
I can't take my eyes off of you.

400
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,830
PREMIER GOYA: You must stay
next to me all night long

401
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:33,232
and whatever comes after.

402
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,770
My wife is talking

403
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,004
to the target of an assassination plot.

404
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:41,372
We gotta get her out of there.

405
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,840
I'm going in.

406
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,174
Awesome, calm down.

407
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:47,276
Let the professional handle this.

408
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:49,845
I hope I'm not interrupting.

409
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:50,846
No.

410
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:54,217
No. Sarah, this is, uh, the premier.

411
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:55,451
Call me Generalissimo.

412
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,652
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

413
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,953
You know, I have to say

414
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:00,956
my doctor tells me to avoid this,
uh, stimulation.

415
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,224
But then again, my doctor is your husband.

416
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:09,068
Well, I'm, I'm so sorry,
but I need to borrow her

417
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:10,537
for a second, Generalissimo.

418
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:12,040
Girl talk.

419
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:13,942
She's good.

420
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,443
The best.

421
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,346
Thank God you rescued me.

422
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,381
That guy's cologne was practically a WMD.

423
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,285
So, what did you want to talk to me about?

424
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,655
Ugh.

425
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:30,389
I'm sorry. Of course.

426
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:32,424
Of course, this must be
really hard for you guys.

427
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,426
Yeah. It is.

428
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,160
I mean, one minute you're broken up,

429
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:37,561
and then the next minute,

430
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,496
you're on this incredibly sexy date.

431
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:41,498
So, what's the deal with you guys?

432
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:43,399
I mean, not to be crass or anything,

433
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:46,936
but you and Sarah ever, like, you know?

434
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:48,971
No.

435
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,739
Never? Nope.

436
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:54,141
Huh. I always thought you guys were,
like, a real couple.

437
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,345
Sarah, do you still have
feelings for my brother?

438
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,347
No. No. We're...

439
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,349
Chuck and I are just friends.

440
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,351
Sarah, please. Look at yourself right now.

441
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,353
I mean, look at the dress.

442
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,687
Look me in the eye

443
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,822
and tell me that you guys are just friends.

444
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:18,159
Yeah, it's our job to fool people like you.

445
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,193
Wow.

446
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:20,595
That must be hard.

447
00:18:20,662 --> 00:18:22,863
Not just the not-having-sex part.

448
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,665
That must be excruciating.

449
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:28,501
But having to fake like
you're in love with someone

450
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,103
for almost three years.

451
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,071
Especially someone like her.

452
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:35,941
How do you do it, Chuck?

453
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:38,009
How do you not fall for her?

454
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,715
I don't think

455
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,883
that you understand our situation.

456
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:46,885
I understand completely.

457
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:50,321
I do. You know, you go
through hot and cold patches.

458
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:52,723
When Devon and I got married, we kind of put

459
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,457
the passion on hold, but...

460
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:57,326
being here in a place like this, it just...

461
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,828
brings it all back, you know?

462
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:02,397
It feels like it did in the beginning.

463
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,300
CASEY : All right, ladies--

464
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,468
yeah, I'm talking to you, too, Bartowski.

465
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,970
Enough with the chitchat.

466
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,507
Let's get back to protecting our
foreign head of state, shall we?

467
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:16,243
Friends,

468
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:18,745
ex-patriots, countrymen...

469
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:20,079
CASEY : Great, a speech.

470
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:22,014
Makes him a walking target. It's so good

471
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,048
to be here with all of you.

472
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:27,351
I see many of my old comrades here tonight.

473
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:29,919
Men who never dreamed

474
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:32,588
one day we'd meet in the heart

475
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,522
of this Capitalist beast,

476
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,524
Los Angeles.

477
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:41,099
* *

478
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,667
And I see new faces here tonight as well.

479
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:45,669
<i>Americanos, they never dreamed</i>

480
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:48,671
that one night they would
be dining and dancing

481
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,673
in the soil of Costa Gravas!

482
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,908
Hey! GUESTS (chanting, Goya! Goya!
Hey! GUESTS (chanting, Goya! Goya!

483
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:56,211
Goya, Goya, Goya, Goya, Goya...

484
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,879
No, no. No, no.

485
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,415
To symbolize this historic meeting

486
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,450
of two great nations,

487
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:04,952
I would like to invite

488
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,120
Mrs. Dr. Woodcomb...

489
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:09,422
...to this dance.

490
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:11,857
Oh!

491
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:13,258
I-I couldn't possibly.

492
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,028
Listen,

493
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,062
relax.

494
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,163
You know what they say?

495
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:22,732
When in Costa Gravas...

496
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,001
Okay.

497
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:28,636
* *

498
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,722
<i>Arriba!</i>

499
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,062
I ran the guest list against our database

500
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,830
Got a hit. Subject entered

501
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,064
on a stolen passport.

502
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,999
I'm uploading you the photo right now.

503
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,067
Huh.

504
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,302
Charming. Who is he?

505
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,171
Real name's Pablo Alarcon. Freedom fighter.

506
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,173
Guy spent 20 years in a Costa Gravan prison

507
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,942
for trying to overthrow the Communist party.

508
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,344
* *

509
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,817
Sarah... Okay, I see him.

510
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,452
We need to take him out
before the guards see us.

511
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,787
Remember, we're in Costa Gravan soil.

512
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,054
They'll arrest us

513
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:38,223
if we make a sudden move toward the premier.

514
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,692
We need to get across that dance floor.

515
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:45,163
* *

516
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,541
Chuck?

517
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:03,010
Just follow my lead, huh?

518
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,651
There he is.

519
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,694
* *

520
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,809
The assassin is behind you.

521
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:43,877
Take him out.

522
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,245
Three, two... one!

523
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,120
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

524
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:00,055
What is it? False alarm.

525
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:01,856
He's just a political protester.

526
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,157
Yeah, Casey, guess what.

527
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:04,692
Your assassin was carrying

528
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,427
nothing but a rotten egg.

529
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:07,461
Take him and his date.

530
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:09,096
Let them sober up in the alleyway.

531
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:11,264
What? No. I'm sober, I'm sober!

532
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:13,366
Listen, it's a misunderstanding, okay?

533
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,310
Wait. No, no!

534
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:26,377
You don't understand!

535
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:28,046
Premier's life is in danger.

536
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:29,112
I'm just a bad dancer.

537
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,614
It was an accident.

538
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:31,748
No! No!

539
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,149
Sarah, that guy we just passed--

540
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:35,050
that other guard-- he is the real assassin.

541
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:35,951
What happened?

542
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:36,952
Casey, do you copy?

543
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,053
I'm out of position.

544
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,420
The premier is completely unprotected.

545
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:40,588
We need you in here.

546
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:43,123
This way.

547
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:47,226
* *

548
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,272
Comrade.

549
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,808
Doesn't it feel like anything
can happen tonight, honey?

550
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:26,022
Honey. Honey?

551
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:39,601
CAPTAIN: Casey?

552
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:50,644
<i>El Angel de la Muerte.</i>

553
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,347
Take him to the holding
cell in the basement.

554
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,318
Oh, my God!

555
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:00,486
Devon, what happened?

556
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:02,021
I can't believe it.

557
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:03,755
You saved my life.

558
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:05,256
Again!

559
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:07,925
You saved the general from an assassin?

560
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:10,327
I can't believe you just did that.

561
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:12,429
I can't believe it, either.

562
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:15,138
What do you mean, wait?

563
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:19,073
Look, General, I hate to interrupt

564
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:20,908
your little cocktail party
you got going on there,

565
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:22,442
but we got a man down here.

566
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,110
I appreciate your loyalty.

567
00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:26,446
Well, then, send in the Black Ops,
storm the consulate.

568
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:27,914
Costa Gravan soil will be damned.

569
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,949
Casey was doing his job.

570
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:31,350
Given Casey's history with Costa Gravas,

571
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:33,352
I mean, just imagine what
they're doing to him.

572
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,254
We will do everything we can
to get the colonel back...

573
00:25:36,322 --> 00:25:38,022
using diplomatic channels.

574
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,257
Diplomatic channels? General!

575
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:42,559
We can't risk upsetting
relations with Costa Gravas.

576
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:45,061
Their country's future is in the balance.

577
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,730
Until the premier makes his announcement,

578
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,730
I'm afraid Colonel Casey
will have to handle himself.

579
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:53,366
PREMIER GOYA: It's been a long time.

580
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:55,900
When are you going to learn

581
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,737
you do not have the strength to kill me?

582
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,905
I'm here to protect you.

583
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:01,707
The Angel of Death?

584
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:03,008
You're here to protect me?

585
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:04,209
Protect me how?

586
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:06,877
Like in '83-- you put a bullet in my spleen.

587
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,345
Or in '88--

588
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,046
you blew up my dog, Chuy.

589
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:11,181
Sorry about the dog.

590
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:12,883
Obviously, the bomb was meant for you.

591
00:26:16,988 --> 00:26:19,622
I don't know-- maybe I'm
just a humble dictator here.

592
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,190
How stupid do you think I am?

593
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:22,391
I don't think you're stupid.

594
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,392
I think your life is in danger, you idiot.

595
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,027
Enough!

596
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:30,030
Imperialist lies.
Who you calling imperialist,

597
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:32,533
you commie bastard?

598
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,903
I have to get some sleep.

599
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:35,305
You know, tomorrow,

600
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:37,472
I will conduct your interrogation myself.

601
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:42,705
I'll do it personally.

602
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:45,206
Generalissimo.

603
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:48,442
Your cigar. Yeah.

604
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,429
This is genuine Costa Gravan tobacco. Uh-uh.

605
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,964
Rolled on the thighs of virgins. No? Uh-uh.

606
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:26,384
Perhaps you deserve one final smoke.

607
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:29,954
No.

608
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:41,260
Thank you.

609
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,827
For what?

610
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,494
For tonight.

611
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,430
For making me forget about all of this.

612
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:51,699
Do you remember our first
day of medical school?

613
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:57,637
You know, this place has
some very nice closets.

614
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:59,439
Ah.

615
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:06,043
Uh-uh.

616
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:08,145
No phones tonight-- you said.

617
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:10,748
I will turn it off.

618
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,282
It's the consulate.

619
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,184
The premier wants to see me.

620
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:16,285
Some kind of emergency.

621
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:21,121
Hold on to that feeling.

622
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:22,856
I will be right back.

623
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:24,024
Okay.

624
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:30,196
Chuck.

625
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:32,098
I think I can help get Casey back.

626
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,666
Unless you can get into the consulate

627
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:34,767
without starting some
international incident,

628
00:28:34,835 --> 00:28:35,868
I'm not interested.

629
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,436
That's exactly what I can do.

630
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,571
I just got a call.

631
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:39,772
The premier collapsed again.

632
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,374
His last request was for
me to be his doctor.

633
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:47,344
Devon, if you think this is
your chance to be a big spy...

634
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:48,812
It's my chance to set things right.

635
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,180
I'll get you inside,

636
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:52,749
then I promise I will leave
the spy stuff to the pros.

637
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:59,522
I knew you guys had a secret base.

638
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,791
This is badass.

639
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:03,092
Don't touch anything.

640
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,359
Cool.

641
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:05,527
What are you doing?

642
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:06,862
Well, since we're not exactly sure

643
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:08,197
where Casey's being held,

644
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:10,799
I'm pulling up the
schematics for the consulate.

645
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,400
Where's Sarah? We'll call her from the road.

646
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,636
If she knew we were here
right now... What the hell

647
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,571
do you think you're doing? Well,
I don't know.

648
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,372
<i>What the hell do you think
you're doing?</i>

649
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,574
Bringing a civilian in here?
Do you have any idea

650
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:21,608
how far off the reservation you've gone?

651
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,143
Oh, yeah, and what do you call

652
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,811
invading foreign soil against orders?

653
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:26,078
I have no choice.

654
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:28,780
Well, we're coming with u.

655
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:29,948
No. Trust me.

656
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:31,449
You don't want any part of this,

657
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:33,084
and neither do you. What happened?

658
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:34,418
I thought you didn't want your family

659
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:35,619
getting messed up with the CIA.

660
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,054
Okay, look, before you say anything else,

661
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,122
and before you go running off
and getting yourself shot,

662
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,957
Devon thinks he n get us into the consulate.

663
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:42,725
The premier has invited him

664
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:44,493
to be his own persal physician.

665
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:45,594
Okay, here's the plan...

666
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:46,795
Stop right there.

667
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:48,464
I am way ahead of you.

668
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:01,709
I'm Dr. Woodcomb.

669
00:30:01,777 --> 00:30:03,678
We're here to see the premier.

670
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,449
You can do this, Devon.

671
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,283
Just relax.

672
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:24,927
Hello, John Casey.

673
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,895
NSA assassin.

674
00:30:29,498 --> 00:30:30,664
Who are you?

675
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:32,799
The man who's going to kill you.

676
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:34,701
Obviously.

677
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:35,836
Who do you work for?

678
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,504
Professional courtesy.

679
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:38,973
One assassin to another.

680
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,942
I work for an organization
known as the Ring.

681
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:47,816
You want me to work in here?

682
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:49,084
Is there a problem?

683
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:51,386
Yeah, he needs to move to a hospital.

684
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:54,919
Why? So you North Americans can
try and kill him yet again?

685
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:58,155
Tsk-tsk-tsk. The premier's
orders were clear.

686
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,090
Acute arrhythmia.

687
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,558
This guy is hating life.

688
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,759
Don't forget, Dr. Woodcomb--

689
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,827
if anything happens to the premier...

690
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:07,529
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

691
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:09,431
All right, team, let's get to work.

692
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:10,765
<i>So, what does this s o-called Ring</i>

693
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,033
have against the premier?

694
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:13,401
Nothing personal.

695
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:16,369
I suppose I could explain
our overarching goals...

696
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:18,438
but this might tax the brain

697
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:20,305
of an aging NSA agent.

698
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:22,873
Let's just say the Ring wishes to preserve

699
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:25,009
Costa Gravas' status quo.

700
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,211
The premier must die.

701
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:28,712
So must you.

702
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,581
<i>His potassium is off the chart.</i>

703
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:32,715
I need ten units of insulin.

704
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:37,919
Red bottle, yellow label.

705
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:40,355
<i>On a personal note,</i>

706
00:31:40,423 --> 00:31:42,524
<i>I must say, I've studied your work.</i>

707
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,192
Some of your kills in the '80s weren't bad.

708
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,960
Unfortunately,

709
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,061
in our game,

710
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:50,330
you're only as good as your last...

711
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:53,032
kill.

712
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,733
So, you come up with a plan yet?

713
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:56,001
Oh, yeah.

714
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:57,436
Yeah, the plan is, Sarah and I

715
00:31:57,504 --> 00:31:59,271
are going to sneak out
of here and save Casey

716
00:31:59,338 --> 00:32:00,771
while you stay here and save the premier.

717
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,473
We just got to take care
of those two guards there.

718
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,474
Those two soldiers with the machine guns?

719
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:05,708
You and what army?

720
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:07,743
Uh, that would be Sarah

721
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,544
and, uh, her fists.

722
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:11,011
Bring it on, tough guy.

723
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,314
A thousand Costa Gravan pesos
says I walk out of here.

724
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:20,489
Well...

725
00:32:20,557 --> 00:32:22,491
Lucky for me, I'm a marine.

726
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,139
Shh...

727
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,273
Relax.

728
00:32:56,153 --> 00:32:57,587
Let's go.

729
00:32:57,655 --> 00:32:59,323
That is some woman, bro.

730
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,524
You have no idea.

731
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:10,531
You owe me 15 American cents.

732
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,071
<i>Angel de la Muerte.</i>

733
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,038
Let's get out of this

734
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:24,139
stinking banana republic.

735
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:25,273
First, we got to get Awesome.

736
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:26,707
You brought your brother-in-law?

737
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:28,075
What the hell were you thinking?

738
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,277
Devon, we got to get out of here.

739
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:31,545
No, you've got to get out of here.

740
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:32,879
Those guards are looking for you.

741
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:34,380
Besides, he'll die without me. Yeah, well,

742
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,549
we're all going to die if
they find us in here. Come on.

743
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:38,649
Devon, look, we've done what we
needed to do. Now, it's time to go.

744
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,283
Sorry, Chuck. My mission's not over.

745
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,350
You know that man

746
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:42,683
you're trying to save

747
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:44,184
turned his country into a pariah state.

748
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:46,652
Do you have any idea how
many people he killed?

749
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,587
You're one to talk.

750
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,223
<i>Angel de la Muerte.</i>

751
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,058
Look, look,

752
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,459
he's not here as the Angel of Death

753
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:58,061
right now, he's here to
protect your boss; we all are.

754
00:33:58,129 --> 00:33:59,663
The real killer's down in my cell.

755
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,663
We found no one.

756
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:02,265
Uh...

757
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:05,868
Can't you see he's
bleeding to death? Please!

758
00:34:05,936 --> 00:34:07,670
We will sort out who's trying to kill

759
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:10,041
who later; right now,
we need to get this man to a doctor.

760
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:11,876
He has a doctor.

761
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:13,344
Little busy right now.

762
00:34:13,412 --> 00:34:15,080
Not you, him.

763
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:17,050
Who "him"? Me, "him"?

764
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,018
If you wish to prove

765
00:34:19,086 --> 00:34:21,454
you're not an assassin, save him.

766
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:25,824
Okay.

767
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:28,259
Okay, no, uh, no problem.

768
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,360
No problem.

769
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:30,361
We've done this before.

770
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,395
We've done this many times.

771
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:33,363
Uh, normally,

772
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:34,664
I start with anesthesia.

773
00:34:34,732 --> 00:34:36,565
No! Huh?

774
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:41,000
Okay.

775
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:42,368
Okay, no anesthesia.

776
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:43,736
No anesthesia. That's fine, that's fine.

777
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:45,570
He's a big, tough man.
He can deal with the pain.

778
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:46,838
The bullet might've

779
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:48,906
grazed his femoral artery.
Whatever you do...

780
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:52,912
Let the doctor work.

781
00:34:54,448 --> 00:34:55,948
Nurse?

782
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:57,883
Why don't you go ahead
and cut those pants open,

783
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,718
and we'll see what we're working with.

784
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:05,556
Oh, oh...

785
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:06,957
Oh, it's suddenly very hot in here.

786
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:08,125
It's very, very hot in here.

787
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,359
Can somebody crack a window?

788
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:11,127
No!

789
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,829
Just as I thought.

790
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:18,200
Chuck, you've got the
hands of a surgeon, bro.

791
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:19,468
Don't think

792
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,069
about the guns.

793
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:22,604
He's not your friend. He's your patient.

794
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:25,739
Chuck, you can do this.

795
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:27,307
Just relax.

796
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:36,780
Nurse, suction.

797
00:35:37,815 --> 00:35:39,115
Scalpel.

798
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:43,954
Tweezers.

799
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,156
Gauze.

800
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:48,024
Iodine.

801
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,227
Forceps.

802
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:53,895
Just like Operation...

803
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:55,730
The game.

804
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:09,675
What's wrong?

805
00:36:09,743 --> 00:36:11,643
I told you. There's nothing
I could do for him here.

806
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,445
Nothing short of a blood transfusion.

807
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:15,580
I don't even know what blood type he is.

808
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:17,415
AB negative.

809
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:18,916
What?

810
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:19,950
AB negative.

811
00:36:20,017 --> 00:36:22,084
Aah!

812
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:23,618
His blood type's AB negative.

813
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,154
What? You learn a lot about a guy

814
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:27,255
when you're trying to kill him.

815
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:28,857
What else you want to know?

816
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:30,959
<i>His favorite movie's Terms
of Endearment.</i>

817
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:32,793
He always showers

818
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:34,094
after lovemaking...

819
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,062
Okay, none of that's going to save him now.

820
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,163
We need someone with type

821
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,499
AB negative blood, now. Someone big.

822
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:41,933
Does anyone have type AB negative blood?

823
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:46,139
<i>Â¿Alguien aqui tiene sangre
tipo AB negativo?</i>

824
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,507
Quick! Find someone! Anyone!

825
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:48,674
Hey, what are you doing?

826
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:51,309
Put those back!

827
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,343
Give me that!

828
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,544
I'm sorry, buddy.

829
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,513
You take one drop of blood from me,

830
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,914
I swear to God, I'll rip off your...

831
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,686
No! No! No!

832
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,200
Hey, Chucky.

833
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:21,437
Oh, I feel like death.

834
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,705
What happened?

835
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:24,940
You're just in time, big boy.

836
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,441
Time for what?

837
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:29,110
Congratulations,
the premier made a full recovery.

838
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:31,512
Although I do not endorse your methods,

839
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,547
you enabled him to make his
announcement as planned.

840
00:37:33,614 --> 00:37:36,582
Costa Gravas will have its
first democratic election.

841
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,850
And it wouldn't have been
possible without your

842
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:41,919
extraordinary sacrifice.

843
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:43,988
I got shot, that's nothing extraordinary.

844
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:47,691
You don't remember? Huh?

845
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:48,759
Remember what?

846
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:53,596
You stole my blood.

847
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:55,631
You stole my blood, and you

848
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,866
put in a stinking commie despot.

849
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:00,735
<i>Former stinking commie despot.
Thank you.</i>

850
00:38:00,803 --> 00:38:02,070
The premier wanted

851
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:04,138
to thank you personally, Colonel Casey.

852
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:06,640
But this will have to do.

853
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,108
Huh?

854
00:38:17,682 --> 00:38:20,651
<i>PREMIER GOYA: I wish to
thank you on behalf</i>

855
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,120
<i>of Costa Gravas and myself.</i>

856
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:23,554
<i>I will never forget that the blood</i>

857
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:26,490
<i>of an American patriot flows
through my veins.</i>

858
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:31,060
<i>John Casey, you truly are the Angel of
Life.</i>

859
00:38:36,198 --> 00:38:39,934
These are prerevolutionary
Costa Gravas double coronas.

860
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:42,002
Oh...

861
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,515
Hey. Hey.

862
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,750
How'd it go with headquarters?

863
00:38:57,817 --> 00:38:59,485
Yeah, uh,

864
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,854
we didn't get a new mission,
if that's what you're wondering.

865
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:04,622
Oh, no way.

866
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:06,857
I think I scratched my espionage itch.

867
00:39:06,924 --> 00:39:08,724
Don't get me wrong.

868
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,959
Black tie dinners and embassy extractions

869
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:13,360
are killer, but... just not worth it.

870
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:15,696
What's not?

871
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:17,330
If having a double life means

872
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,831
having to give up half of your real life,

873
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,467
that's just not how I want to live, bro.

874
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:25,803
* *

875
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:27,837
I got to run.

876
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:29,908
I've got to finish a few
things at the hospital,

877
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,877
and then home to my wife.

878
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:34,045
You two take care of each other.

879
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:39,282
He would've made an awesome spy.

880
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:43,185
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it runs in the family.

881
00:39:47,523 --> 00:39:50,925
Uh, listen, I've been, um...

882
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:52,326
I've been meaning to ask.

883
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:55,162
What do you think our cover should be,

884
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,864
you know, moving forward?

885
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:02,367
Well, I think we should keep it simple.

886
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,202
So, how about friends?

887
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,171
Friends, huh?

888
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,408
Yeah, that could work.

889
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,311
I suppose I could fake being
friends with someone like you.

890
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:20,081
And I don't find you completely

891
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,716
repulsive, so... Thanks.

892
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:23,584
So, yeah. Friends?

893
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:27,287
Yeah. Yeah, friends.

894
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:34,593
So, what exactly do friends do?

895
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:37,195
What do friends do? Uh,
what is it? Friday night?

896
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:39,030
Friday night, Morgan and I would normally

897
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:40,698
gorge ourselves on some processed food,

898
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,466
play some video games.

899
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,534
Maybe we're not quite there yet.

900
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:47,036
Okay, we can work on some other options.

901
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,237
Yeah.

902
00:40:48,304 --> 00:40:49,704
Hi. CAPTAIN : Hey, babe.

903
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:50,905
Where have you been?

904
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,740
Kind of a crazy night.

905
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:54,174
I got tied up at work.

906
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,876
Well, why don't you

907
00:40:55,944 --> 00:40:57,477
hurry home.

908
00:40:57,545 --> 00:40:59,812
I have a surprise for you.

909
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,615
One more patient and I am on my way.

910
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:04,950
I believe I owe you a dance.

911
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:06,351
I love you.

912
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:08,586
I love you, too.

913
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:15,192
So, what seems to be

914
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,393
the problem?

915
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,797
Ouch, that looks like it hurts.

916
00:41:21,865 --> 00:41:23,499
You have no idea.

917
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:31,372
Hey.

918
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Changed your mind about tonight?

919
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,943
What?

920
00:41:39,614 --> 00:41:41,280
What is it?

921
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:53,290
Oh, my God...

922
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,458
Hey, guys.

923
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:57,760
Have you guys seen my husband?
