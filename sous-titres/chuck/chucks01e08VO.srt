1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,210
who are you?

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,860
I'm a poisoner by trade.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,560
Specifically speaking, i'm your poisoner.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,600
Do you know where the codes are?

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,550
No.
I told you.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,760
Okay.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,710
We're gonna try that again.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,540
Do you know where the codes are?

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,290
Yes.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,030
How did you make me do that?

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,630
My poison starts as truth serum.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,950
U assignment is simple, mr.Whitney.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,270
Just get me my codes.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,730
You have approximately three hours, give or take, before you die.

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,720
As soon as i have my codes...

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,160
I'll give you the antidote.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,770
- You ready?
- Maybe we're in over our heads.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,040
- It's time.
- Sure it's not too dangerous?

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,530
- I'll be an inch away.
- I'm scared.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,980
Let's go over it again.
Make sure we have our bases covered.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,600
God, who'd thought going out to sushi with my sister and her boyfriend would make me so freaked?

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,760
Okay.
Last night we saw a movie.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,140
What was my snack of choice?

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,440
Sprinkled milk duds over your popcorn.
What was i wearing?

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,710
Blue top, little buttons.

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,200
Oh, you like that one?

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,080
I like all of 'em.
What movie were we...

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,620
- why is this door locked?
- What are you doing?

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,630
Girl on top.
Ms.Walker.

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,590
When herr wienerlicious signs your paycheck,

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,630
 i doubt he's factoring in make-out breaks with your  Boy-toy.

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,020
I'm sorry.
I had to act fast.

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,150
I keep pressing the button and nothing's happening.

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,420
Is it fully charged?
'Cause sometimes this...

35
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,410
My entire life is in this thing.
Okay?

36
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,610
I got names, places, dates, times, music, photos, recipes...

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,460
Wow, uh, you-you cook, too?

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,740
What if i lose everything?

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,870
You know, i can't start from scratch.

40
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,860
I can't be the person that i was before this thing came along.

41
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,230
Okay, i'm freaking out!

42
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,920
Listen to me, uh...

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,650
Lou.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,110
Lou?Really?
Lou, i wouldn't put...

45
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,260
This is kind of my world, you know?

46
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,190
This is what...
This is what i do, and i...

47
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,820
I do it pretty good, so...

48
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,620
Trust me.

49
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:16,940
Okay.

50
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,220
I know i'm totally spazzing out.I'm sorry.
It's just...

51
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,170
A little overwhelming to even consider...

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,940
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't go there.Come back.

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,200
Go to a happy place.

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,870
Is there something that you think about that quiets the voices that are in your head?

55
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,870
Turkey.

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,780
Muenster cheese.

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,920
Egg bread.

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,680
Grilled.

59
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,750
Was that a, was that a sandwich?

60
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,030
Yeah, they're my passion.

61
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,810
Uh, the...
Sounds, sounds pretty delicious.

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,060
I own a deli in the mall and i often think about meats and cheeses.

63
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,240
Ah, yes.
Who doesn't?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,700
Look, i-i, uh, i promise you that if you come back tomorrow, 

65
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,320
your phone will be all fixed up and  Good to go.Okay?

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,280
- Really?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,160
Thank you.So much.

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,370
It's been nice talking with you, chuck.

69
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,090
Yeah, you too, lou.

70
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,870
That rhymed.
I-i-i didn't actually mean for that to rhyme.

71
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,500
- It's okay.
- Okay.

72
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,920
* mind-cheater.

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,380
* saw you.

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,080
Saw me what?

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,130
Saw you what?
Dude, are you kidding me?

76
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,640
Mind-cheating with the broken phone girl.

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,490
And why wouldn't you?

78
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,590
Her hair looked so much like licorice, 

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,490
i wanna chew on it till i make myself sick.

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,390
But you, well, gee whiz, chuck, you already have hair to chew on.

81
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,980
What?
What the hell are you talking about?

82
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,870
Name sarah ring a...

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,220
Hot blonde with two big bells?

84
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,750
You know, just because you didn't actually do anything with licorice hair doesn't mean you didn't  Want to.

85
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,880
Think about that.

86
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,340
- mind-cheater.
-Don't.

87
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,460
-  saw you.
- Get...Ah!

88
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,190
<i>man: your assignment is simple, mr.Whitney

89
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,070
</i> my codes, they're still here.

90
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,150
Oh, and also, and also a...

91
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,820
A crab hand-roll for the lady.

92
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,150
Light wasabi, but like light-light, almost as if you just washed your hands 

93
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,160
and only the residue   Of previous orders remains.

94
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,590
Didn't realize how old-fashioned you were, chuck.

95
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,730
Oh, why?
Cause i was ordering food for my girl?

96
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,290
Well, i guess i just know what she likes.

97
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,790
You sure do.

98
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,600
Thanks, sweetie.

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,900
Welcome, sweetie.

100
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,550
No, no.
Old fashioned how slow you guys are taking things.

101
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,380
- Devon...
- what?

102
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,080
I mean you guy are joined at the hip, but that's not where you're supposed to be joined.

103
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,500
I mean it's like the east wing of our apartment has taken a vow of celibacy.

104
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,450
That is none of our business.
Um, edamame?

105
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,750
Oh, your sleeve.

106
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,740
Oh, shoot.

107
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,600
Are you ever gonna retire that sweater, ellie?

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Hope not.

109
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,090
It's my lucky sweater.

110
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,870
More like my lucky sweater.

111
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,030
Was wearing it the first time i met ellie in an epidemiology class...

112
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,160
He told me that l.L.
Bean must've stol'v the color from my eyes, 

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
so it really belonged to me.

114
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,140
Thank you for dinner.

115
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,070
Well, you guys wait here.

116
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,590
I'll get the car.
I found a space around the corner.

117
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,860
Sir.

118
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,130
Ellie: can you hear me?

119
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,510
what is your name?

120
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,980
?????

121
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,830
can you hear me,sir

122
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,590
Shallow respiration, thready pulse.

123
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,580
Chuck, check...
Check for medical id.

124
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,160
Help me, please.
Help me.

125
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,020
Just, just relax.
We're doing everything we can.

126
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,790
That's my sister.

127
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,450
Eleanor fay bartowski is saving that dude's life!

128
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,800
That's my sister.

129
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,110
Saving that bad dude's life.

133
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,880
Hey, hey, do you think, uh, do you think ellie's okay?

134
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,950
Should i call the hospital again?

135
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,190
You've called ten times in the past 20 minutes.

136
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,900
Yeah, i know, but what-what about sweaty nuclear guy?

137
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,770
What-what if he hurts her?

138
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,880
Come on, chuck.People saw ellie at the er.
She is gonna be fine.

139
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,530
 you spending the night?

140
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,630
My little pep talk must've inspired you guys.
Mazel tov.

141
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,920
Yeah, uh, actually, sarah's just hanging out until ellie gets home.

142
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
Why?She's a doctor, chuck.

143
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,400
Emergencies happen.

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,170
You know, when somebody asks, "is there a doctor in the house?

145
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,370
" that's our cue.

146
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,930
I'm gonna make some coffee.
Do you want some?

147
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,100
Absolutely.

148
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,470
Listen, i know it's been a while since you've taken your, uh...

149
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,740
Your bike out for a ride, you know.

150
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,860
But it is time to oil up that rusty chain, x

151
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,620
hop on that seat, and start pedaling away, bro.

152
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,410
You never forget how to ride, okay.

153
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,130
Lock it out.

154
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,160
Come on.

155
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,280
Nice.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,580
Aw, hey, there she is.

157
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,320
Hi, honey.

158
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,740
Ellie!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

159
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,250
Oh, my god, you're okay.Oh, my god, you're fine.
You're fine.

160
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,240
Why wouldn't she be fine?

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
What happened?

162
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,480
We tried everything.Nothing worked.
I think he was...

163
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,930
Poisoned or had an allergic reaction or something.

164
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,230
I'm going to bed.Good night, guys.

165
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,060
- Night, guys.
- Good night.

166
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,000
- Night.
- Night.

167
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm getting way too comfortable lying and sneaking around all this spy stuff, okay.

168
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,060
I'm starting to feel that that is my real life.

169
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,970
It's all to be expected.

170
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,950
It's an existential spy crisis of sorts.

171
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,360
It used to be all compartmentalized, you know.

172
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,790
Chuck world and spy world.

173
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,480
But when i watched those ambulance doors close 

174
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,610
and my sister was behind them with that sweaty  

175
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,210
Nuclear spy freak, my worlds collided.

176
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,780
I put ellie's life in danger.

177
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,610
No, chuck, that guy was sick with or without the intersect in your head.

178
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,180
And spy world or no, ellie helped that guy because that is what she is trained to do.

179
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,050
Yeah, i guess so.

180
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,070
There's something else i have to talk to you about.

181
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,490
What's that?

182
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,860
I'm a little worried about our cover.

183
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,020
I think it's time for us to make love.

184
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,680
It's a hot coffee.

185
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,190
<i>beckman: the intersect was correct</i> in identifying mason whitney; 

186
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,970
subject had nuclear   Intel.

187
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,640
However, bartowski incorrectly perceived whitney as a threat.

188
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,190
Chuck's not wrong very often.

189
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,690
But he's annoying all the time.

190
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,850
Whitney was a programmer mmfor a top-secret project, code name: "sanctuary.

191
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,970
" when whitney disappeared, so did the sanctuary data embedded on a computer chip.

192
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,180
Wait.So whoever has the chip essentially has a skeleton key to access 
our nuclear facilities?

193
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,470
Precisely, agent walker.

194
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,830
In the wrong hands, this is potentially catastrophic.

195
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,410
Casey, bring chuck with you to e morgue.

196
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,460
Maybe there's a clue only he can see to ascertain whitney's true cause of death.

197
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,360
Agent walker, search the body for the missing codes.

198
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,870
Maybe there's a chance he still has them on him.

199
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,260
Dude.

200
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,920
This is weird.

201
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,470
You're back from lunch on time.

202
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,740
Big mike's working me to the bone, dude.

203
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,830
He's got me on some extra assignment, says it was super secret.

204
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,410
Don't tell me because if you tell me, it's not gonna be a secret...

205
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,540
Wants me to help tang's wife pick out a gift for their anniversary.

206
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,330
Well, that's great.
I mean he trusts you.

207
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,890
No, no, dude, i don't have time for this.

208
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,570
I'm a very busy man-boy.

209
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,410
Morgan, think of it like this: think of it as an opportunity to learn something 

210
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,400
you'd otherwise   Never know about our freakish leader.

211
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,580
O...Kay.

212
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,990
Ms.Harry tang?

213
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,530
Thick mike say you help me pick prize for harry.

214
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,360
Yeah, hi, i'm morgan.

215
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,990
Shh, big secret.

216
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,080
Poopie-cat is the jealous type.

217
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,550
Keep it under your head.

218
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,920
Morgan: have any idea what harry wants?

219
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,320
Poppy: i buy him plasma tv, biggt you got.

220
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,390
Okay.

221
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,010
I'm gonna go draw up the paperwork.

222
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,930
Harry be so happy!
Eat it up.x

223
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,410
Give me some sugar, sugar.

224
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,260
- Oh, yeah, there's some sugar.
- This'll be helpful to us one day, jeffrey.x

225
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,300
Meet me in the home theater room tomorrow night.

226
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,340
Knowledge is power.

227
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,810
My mom used to say "knowledge is powder.

228
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,270
" you don't talk about your mom much.

229
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,650
She's doing a stretch up in the state pen at chowchilla.

230
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,140
Move, move.

231
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,090
Okay, just give me the verdict, chuck; i can take it.

232
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,220
You sure you want to hear?

233
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,620
If you're teasing me, please stop.

234
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,110
If you're not teasing me, don't lie to me.

235
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,920
Good as new-ish.

236
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,860
I don't believe you.

237
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,900
You can learn a lot about a person through their cell phone, by the way.

238
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,580
For example, i saw that you listed your nana first, under "a nana.

239
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
" thank you.

240
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,800
Hey, yeah.

241
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,350
You really saved my ass, chuck.

242
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,660
Wow, you love your nana and you have the mouth of a trucker.

243
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,270
You're a very complicated woman, lou.

244
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,390
I brought you something.

245
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,450
For fixing it.

246
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,470
Thanks.

247
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,750
A sandwich?

248
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,770
?????

249
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,200
????

250
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,240
??

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,640
you know, you should come by the shop sometime and taste it fresh.

252
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,110
Yeah, yeah.Yeah.

253
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,850
Yes, i'd love that.

254
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,380
Lou, this is kind of the biggest honor...

255
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,010
Sarah!

256
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,780
Hi.

257
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,870
I'm sarah.

258
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,910
Lou...
Lou is her name.

259
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,670
This is lou.

260
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,010
I was fixing lou's phone for her, lou.

261
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,720
Who's that?
That's sarah.

262
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,290
 sh-she said that.

263
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,280
Uh, who's sarah?

264
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,160
Sarah...Is..

265
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,280
What's the best way to describe...

266
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,870
- Sarah is my...
- girlfriend

267
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,810
Sarah: nice to meet you.

268
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,310
Nice to meet you, sarah.

269
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,100
Uh, you should refrigerate that 'cause it'd be a shame for the chuck to make you sick.

270
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,340
Yes, absolutely, i...

271
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,860
Great idea.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,080
Uh, there's more to the mason whitney incident than we thought.

273
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,880
????

274
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,200
Chuck: okay, this is just a storage room.

275
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,790
They just happen to store people in this room, 

276
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,330
people who are no longer breathing and who are   Refrigerated.

277
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,080
Man up, bartowski.

278
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
Got to store 'em somewhere.

279
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,810
Better than stacked up on a curb like garbage, right?

280
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,330
Eyes on the prize.

281
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,320
Getting any flashes?

282
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,540
Good lord, the man is naked!

283
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Appears rigor mortis has set in, too.

284
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,270
Find anything?

285
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,840
Nothing yet.

286
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,300
No codes.

287
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,990
Hang on a second.
What is this?

288
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,250
<i>man: i appreciate you taking</i> the time to answ my questions, dr.Bartowski.

289
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:14,930
Not at all.

290
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,820
Okay, now, did the deceased hand anything to you?

291
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,770
No.

292
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,940
Say anything specific to you?

293
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,410
He just asked me to help him.

294
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,430
Did you hide anything for him?

295
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,210
I beg your pardon?

296
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,210
Did he transfer anything to your person?

297
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,560
I've told you everything i know, officer.

298
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,510
I'm sorry if i can't be more help.

299
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,640
That's all right.

300
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,780
Okay, i think we have everytng we need.

301
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,600
If you don't mind, i'd just like to get a quick photo for the records.

302
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,100
Bug.

303
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,160
All right.

304
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,940
Actually, i'm just going to move your hair back a bit.

305
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,970
It's just a protocol required for the framing.
Okay.

306
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,430
Now...

307
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,380
Say "cheesecake.

308
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,280
" cheesecake.

309
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,430
What is it?

310
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,490
The guy was poisoned.

311
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,690
Toxic derivative of pentothal.

312
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,210
Initially, the subject becomes uncontrollably truthful.

313
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:35,440
After it accumulates in the occipital lobe, victim suffers from unconsciousness and eventually...Death.

314
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,230
- What's the timeline on this thing?
- Can't say.x

315
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,590
Could be a couple hours.

316
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,660
Could be minutes depending on the concentration.

317
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,080
I just need you to sign this affidavit and we'll be all done.

318
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,940
If i think of anythg else, i will be sure to let you know.

319
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm sure you will.

320
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,610
Have a good day, sir.

321
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,630
Tiniest cop i've ever seen.

322
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,500
You know the rules, walker.

323
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,590
Not while the green's out of the machine.

324
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,650
Your parents did real number on you, didn't they?

325
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,920
Yes, they did.

326
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,500
Hi.Come here.

327
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,400
I just wanted to make sure we're all set for tonight's mission.

328
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,490
I mean, it's, you know, it's been a while since i've slept with someone-- 

330
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,830
<i>no-no-not, not slept   With someone, but slept with s...

331
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,790
</i> it's actually been a while since i've done either one, so...

332
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,860
Chuck, listen, i know this is kind of uncomfortable.

333
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,780
I'm fine.It's fine.

334
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,160
- It's just that we have to do it...
- Got it.

335
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,500
-  meannot, not do it.
- I got it.

336
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,180
- so we don't blow...
- I goit.

337
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,140
- Our cover.
- I got it.I got it.

338
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,690
Okay.

339
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,400
Lou!

340
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,710
Hey!Hey, hey.

341
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,750
Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, lou, listen.

342
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,410
About earlier with sarah, i can explain.

343
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,400
Forget it, chuck.

344
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,650
You don't have to be single to fix a broken phone, right?

345
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,380
Maybe our signals just got crossed.

346
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,310
No, no, not at all.
That's...

347
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,710
That's kind of what i'm trying to say is that they...

348
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,010
They weren't crossed.

349
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,400
You know, sarah and i, me and sarah, that whole thing, it's really very...

350
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,690
It's complicated?

351
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,190
Well, is she your girlfriend or not?

352
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,390
Well, yeah, sort of, kind of hard to explain.

353
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,410
I really, really, very badly wish that i could explain.

354
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,410
Listen, if you're not going to tell me the truth, i'll tell you.
Okay?x

355
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,200
I like you.

356
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,260
I like almost everything about you.

357
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,070
I think you're cute, you're funny.

358
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,310
Our vast height difference intrigues me.

359
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,200
But want to know what i don't like?

360
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
Very, very much.

361
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,130
I think anyone who cheats on his girlfriend is a big, fat, stupid jackass.

362
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,510
Exactly, i concur.

363
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,560
Of course you do, which is why i like you.

364
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,560
Why don't we do this, okay?

365
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:29,540
If your situation ever gets less complicated, you just let me know.
Okay?

366
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,210
Okay.Yeah.

367
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,120
Lou: i got it.

368
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,740
Have a great day.
Drive safe.

369
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,810
Morgan meet me in the home theater room tomorrow night.

370
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,200
Again.

371
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,860
You sure, harry?
You've watched it, like, 20 times.

372
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,860
Again!

373
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,110
Meet me in the home theater room tomorrow night.

374
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,420
Again!

375
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,540
Meet me in the home theater room tomorrow night.

376
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,290
Let's watch it again.

377
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,000
ellie let me in

378
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,940
Wow, chuck.

379
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,470
What do you think is going to happen here tonight?

380
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,980
Why?

381
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,440
What do you, what do you think i think?

382
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,060
Well, i don't know, the, the candles and the music.

383
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,060
I mean, you do know we're just spendinthe night together for cover, right?

384
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,660
Why, why would i possibly think anything else?

386
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,440
I mean, by now i'd say i'm pretty familiar with the concept of faking it, so...

387
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,130
Sarah chuck, we've got to take this assignment seriously.

388
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,740
Chuck: okay, i'll lose the music.

389
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,360
You can change in the bathroom.

390
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,210
That's okay.

391
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,390
What?

392
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,930
You're giving me crap about lighting some candles and you come in wearing that?

393
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,900
What, this?This, this ipart of my cover.

394
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,540
Well, it doesn't cover a thing.

395
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,170
And what if ellie or awesome were to walk in?

396
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,290
This is exactly what a girlfriend would wear to seduce her boyfrien i am just being professional.

397
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,580
Yeah...

398
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,360
The world's oldest profession.

399
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,920
Oh...

400
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,800
Well, that's real nice, chuck.

401
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,700
What is the matter wi you tonight anyway?

402
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,770
Captain want to watch some tv, babe?

403
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,650
Ellie: no, read a book.

404
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,400
?????

405
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,830
You think chuck's going to seal the deal wi sarah tonight?

406
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,740
Gross, you're talking about my brother.

407
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,940
He's got your genes, babe, and i ought to know the bartowskis are very passionate people.

408
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,440
Remember the last time we spent the night at your parents' house?

409
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,010
I found em bouncing around in the jacuzzi.

410
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,550
Whoa.
Brain stamp.

411
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,940
Shoe doesn't feel so great when it's on the other foot, now, does it?

412
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,450
And you know what?
You know what?

413
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,330
What's up, what's up with the porno shorts, huh?

414
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,590
I mean, clearly mrs.Heditsian likes to enjoy all the hills and valleys, 

415
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,960
but really, really they leave, like, nothing   To the imagination!

416
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,750
Okay.Babe, youruh...

417
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,010
Your mood tonight is super-honest, and i think that's awesome.

418
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,160
And then there's that.

419
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,910
Ellie "awesome.

420
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,130
" everything is so freaking "awesome.

421
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,070
" let me tell you something.

422
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,330
If everything is awesome and there is no unawesome, then "awesome" by definition is just  Mediocre!

423
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,660
And when was the last time you did something nice for me?

424
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,840
Just bought me something for no reason just because it's a monday?

425
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,780
We're starting to und like them, aren't we?

426
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,150
A little.

427
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,530
Are you okay?

428
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,840
Is there anything you want to talk about?

429
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,170
What exactly are the rules with our...

430
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,470
Likeyou know, our, our thing?

431
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,340
What do you mean?

432
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,920
What do i...
What do i mean?

433
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,880
I mean hypothetically speaking, are we allowed to see other people?

434
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,570
Well, uh...

435
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,960
Our cover is boyfriend/girlfriend, so tactically, that would be challenging.

436
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,100
Plus any prospective date would have to endure a rigorous vetting process to determine her  Motivation.

437
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,640
Wouldn't her motivation be love?

438
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,900
Ideally, but you're a very important piece of intelligence, 

439
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,940
and you have to be handled with  Extreme care.

440
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,730
Well, that sounds very nice.

441
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,500
Chuck, i don't have to be a spy to piece together the clues here.

442
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,500
You're interested in that lou girl, aren't you?

443
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,290
Well, i...

444
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,450
Come on, babe.

445
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,450
Get back in bed.

446
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:28,950
You know what?

447
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,420
I think i'm just going to sleep on the floor.

448
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,820
Sarah chuck, we can't mpromise our cover.

449
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,620
Chuck well, i feel compromised already.

450
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,240
I have known him since the day he was born obviously.

451
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,440
When people would ask him what he wanted to be 

452
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,370
when he grew up, he would always say the same   Thing: "big boy.

453
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,620
" how cute is that?

454
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,120
Ellie, you're killing me here.

455
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,310
<i>and now he is a big boy.

456
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,330
</i> and i can tell that he is because he is with a big...

457
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,670
Big girl.

458
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,640
Sorry, guys.

459
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,600
Don't mean to muck up your mojo.

460
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,440
Tried to stop her.

461
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,320
Is she drunk?

462
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,490
Ellie: chuck, you need a haircut.

463
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,170
It's starting to make funny animal shapes.

464
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,040
Captain: let's go, babe.

465
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,700
These two need their privacy, huh?

466
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,730
When you were seven, i told you that a burglar stole the money from your piggy bank.

467
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,810
That was a lie.
It was me.x

468
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,340
At the time, i felt it was very important for me to have a backstreet boys fanny pack.

469
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,970
Ellie, are you okay?

470
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,440
Have you done anything out of the ordinary?

471
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,650
Words taste like peaches.

472
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,810
Captain: okay, we going to go now.

473
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,910
Let you kids get back to doing whatever it is you're doing.

474
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,120
Have fun, all right.

475
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,640
Hey, sorry to bother you folks.Can you spare some milk?
All out.

476
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,020
Moo juice coming right up.

477
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,620
Casey, what are you doing here?

478
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,780
Getting some crosstalk.

479
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,110
Why?
What from?

480
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,440
Those pajamas maja you look like dennis the menace's father.

481
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,300
Ellie.
Ellie, ellie!

482
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,430
Well, she was poisoned.

483
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,430
Pulled the vio surveillance.

484
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,390
Man, posing as an officer, exposed your sister to the poison.

485
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,380
Why would anyone want to hurt ellie?

486
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,010
She doesn't know anything about nuclear codes.

487
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,880
She doesn't even want us to own a microwaveic ????

488
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,060
???good news,  means the person who poisoned her is  

489
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,350
Still out there looking for the intel chip.

490
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,060
, no, no, no, no.
There is no good news.

491
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,410
Okay, you just told me that my sister was poisoned by the same stuff as a dead guy.

492
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,550
Chuck, our medical teams are trying to identify the poisoning agent to create an antidote for  Ellie.

493
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,200
?????no time!

494
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,450
If it's the same poison as the dead guy, that means ellie's only got a few hours left.

495
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,110
Look, this is easy.

496
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,920
All we've got to do is find the codes, and we get get the bad guy to trade us for the antidote.

497
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,430
Okay, we do this kind of thing in our sleep.

498
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,150
Even if we knew where the codes were, at's not a practical plan.

499
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,000
Can't risk the bad guy endangering millions of lives for the one.

500
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,440
This is my sister we're talking about, all rht?

501
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,670
We can't just sit around and watch her die.

502
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,400
Sarah: okay, the only clue we have so far is the bug that we found on ellie.

503
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,340
Soundproof box.

504
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,210
Don't want the bad guy knowing we're onto him.

505
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,950
We've got a team working on reversing the tracking signal.

506
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,340
Hey, what are you doing?

507
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,590
No!Found the codes.

508
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,970
Can't believe where mason whitney hid them.

509
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,770
I'm going to keep them on the lady doctor until we can move them safely.

510
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,940
Now the bad guy's going to come to us.

511
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,630
Not bad, bartowski.

512
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,480
Do that ever again and i'll kill you.

513
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,810
I'm going to fix this, ellie, i swear.

514
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,990
Look, i know that you just think i'm just chuck, your screw-up little brother.

515
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,990
But there's a lot about me you don't know.

516
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,440
See, i'm, i'm...

517
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,690
I'm also chuck, the guy with all these...

518
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,300
Important governnt secrets in my brain.

519
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,500
<i>i can make this better.

520
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,950
I will make this better.

521
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,640
</i> everything is so different now.

522
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,180
Ellie, everything is so different now.

523
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,190
I used to be able to come you, and ask your advice about anything.

524
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,440
And now, my whole life is, like, a lie.

525
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,690
Went downstairs to get ellie's sweater from her locker.

526
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,610
Her lucky sweater.

527
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,370
She could use it.

528
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,930
Thanks, devon.

529
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,630
* okay.

530
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,650
I've got what you want.

531
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,620
The antidote to save your doctor friend.

532
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,120
Give it to her.

533
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
She might live.

534
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,090
Just trade me for the codes.

535
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,380
Or...

536
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,690
I can poison all of you and force you to tell me where you've hidden my codes.

537
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,760
And then you'll die, too, just like the doctor.

538
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,810
Your choice.

539
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,320
I found them!I found them!
I found them.

540
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,260
- I got the codes.The codes are on the necklace.
- ???????????

541
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,740
Wait!

542
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,210
Casey, wait,?????

543
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,570
Here.

544
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,210
No, no, it's for ellie.

545
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,360
, i'm sorry.There's no debate.
It has to be you.

546
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,190
You're the intersect.

547
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
I won't take it knowing that ellie will die without it, 

548
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,570
that both of you have been poisoned, too.

549
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,190
You're a good person, chuck, and i respect that, but i got a job to do.

550
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,690
So take it before i shove it down your throat.

551
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,110
Okay, okay, fine.I'll do it.

552
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,900
Thank you.

553
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,890
I'll pretend to agree to take it, 

554
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,020
then i'll run like hell to my sister's room and make her take  it.

555
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,140
Why did i just say that out loud?

556
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,850
'S the poison.

557
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,870
It makes you tell the truth.

558
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,480
You do that, i'll give chase, put a gun to your head, 

559
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,910
threaten to pull the trigger if you don't  Take it.

560
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,140
Would you really shoot me?

561
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,460
- No.
- Yeah, don't waste the bullet.

562
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,470
We're already dead.

563
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,620
I'm saving my sister.

564
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,950
you know, if i had a blog this would be a really big day for me.

565
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,500
Do my laundry?
Check.

566
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,750
Save my sister's life?
Check.

567
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,300
Save my own life?

568
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,180
Final entry.

569
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,060
I am so sorry about all of this.

570
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,090
That's okay.
That's okay.

571
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,690
It's not ideal, but i've lived a pretty good life, you know?

572
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:56,610
I mean, how many guys can say they've landed a 
helicopter and saved the lives of innocent people?

573
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,460
Courageous and honorable members of the united states military.

574
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,640
And hey, and the silver lining is now 
i don't have to work out my five-year plan again.

575
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,170
Streamlined that down to about five hours.

576
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,590
Bad guy's name is riordan payne.

577
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,530
Used to be an olympic gymnast, blew out his knee.

578
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,670
Now he sells hard-to-find items, 
like nuclear codes, to hard-to-find people.

579
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,010
Lots of people want to spend lots of cash on these codes, 
but they're not going to get the chance. 

580
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,060
Oh. Why not?

581
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,090
Because this thing's going to lead us rightuso him.

582
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,310
- i got it.
- I got it

583
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,190
i got it.

584
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,150
Well, who's better at it?

585
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,490
I am.

586
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,960
She is Damn truth serum.

587
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,400
God, you're so pretty.

588
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,360
Casey, your jaw was chiseled by michelangelo himself.

589
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:23,990
Thank you.

590
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,050
Oh, yeah.

591
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,940
Payne: yes?

592
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,970
Who is it?

593
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,460
The nsa, cia and me, who's a little tougher to explain, but...

594
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,790
We all have our skill set.

595
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,970
Sarah: freeze.

596
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,940
My partner would rather shoot you in the face than let you get away.

597
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,360
You called me your partner?

598
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,600
Where are the codes, you son of a bitch?

599
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,430
Where's the antidote?

600
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,820
Actually, i was just about to enjoy a little antidote myself.

601
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,540
What kind of host would i be if i didn't offer you some as well?

602
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,140
(gun chamber clickin c casey: careful there.

603
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,630
Haven't killed anyone in a while.

604
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,460
Getting a little hungry.

605
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,670
No, no, no!Wait, wait, wait!
Don't, don't, don't!


606
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,210
You have a flash?

607
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,210
No.

608
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,470
No.
I've just read tons of comic books.

609
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,120
And the villai always samples it first.

610
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,090
Good one, chuck.

611
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:45,970
All right.

612
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,190
Very unsportsmanlike.

613
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,600
I like it.

614
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,630
The antidote's in the cabinet, bottom right shelf.

615
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,760
Key is in my pocket.

616
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,550
Codes are in my right shoe.

617
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,510
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

618
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,550
Not yet.
Not yet.

619
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,760
Why?
What's the matter?

620
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,880
Nothing.
It's just that this...

621
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,990
This will probably be the last chance that i have to know the truth.

622
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,750
I know you're...

623
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,390
You're just doing your job here, but sometimes it feels so real, you know?

624
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,750
So, tell me.

625
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,210
You and me.
Us.

626
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,160
Our thing under the undercover thing.

627
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,000
Is this ever going anywhere?

628
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm sorry, chuck.

629
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,970
No.

630
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,490
Got it...

631
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,450
Got it.
Thank you for being host.

632
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,970
Even though i guess you don't really have a choice in the matter.

633
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,380
Not bad.

634
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,560
Received the codes</i> and now our weapons sites are more secure than ever.

635
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,840
Congratulations on a jobell done.

636
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,400
Trying to diddle my wife?

637
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,730
I'll show you.?????

638
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,730
Okay, morgan grimes.

639
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,090
You mess with the bull, you get the horns.

640
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,520
Major casey, you've infiltrated the htr.

641
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,910
I...I...
I see nothing out of the ordinary here.

642
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,420
Carry on, bartowski.

643
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,240
Stay right where you are.

644
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,600
Chuck: wait, wait, wait.Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you goinyoto do with him?

645
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,540
We'll take care of it.

646
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,350
Oh, you're good, tang, very good.

647
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,020
I am?

648
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,620
- Oh, of course, 
- you are.

649
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,900
I know you've been onto us for a while now, but you nailed us this time.

650
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,890
I...
I did?

651
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,640
Course, you did.

652
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,700
I know you've always known that sarah and i worked undercover for the government.

653
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,750
I knew it!

654
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,410
I knew bartowski couldn't bag anyone as hot as blondie.

655
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,610
Oh, never mind bartowski.

656
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,810
He's small potatoes.

657
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,810
Just the pawn we used to lure you here.

658
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,960
I'm the big potato?

659
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,130
U're the big potato.

660
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,270
We're requesting you relocate to oahu and await further instructinns on how to aid your country  From there.

661
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,490
- I'm going to be a spy?
- No.

662
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,230
That would give a name to it.

663
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,600
Leave the buy more.

664
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,520
I never thought this day would come.

665
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,100
Don't know what it is about this place, but it gets under your skin.

666
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,980
Yeah.

667
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,110
Proud to serve my country in any way i can, sir.

668
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,340
Hey, big me, you wanted to see me?

669
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,630
Thanks for your help with harry tang's wife.

670
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,620
Did me a huge favor.

671
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,610
Yeah, well, just doing my job there, sir.

672
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,430
Oh, and grimes?

673
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,730
Uh-huh change the shipping address on tang's plasma delivery.

674
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,200
Send it to their new place in oahu.

675
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,970
Oahu?

676
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,980
Tang got himself a...

677
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,980
Taste of the sweet life.

678
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,070
Manager of some pineapple factory.

679
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,390
Wait.
So, we're free?

680
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,330
No more harry tang?

681
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,600
- Guess i'm not the only one glad to see him go.
- No.

682
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,690
Know he can be tough, but use your discretion with this information.

683
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,300
I got so many secrets crammed in here, fire marshal wants to shut it down.

684
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,820
Had no choice but to give harry tang the assistant manager position.

685
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,770
Felt so damned guilty about...

686
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,260
Diddling his wife for the past six months.

687
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,260
No, i will not miss the man at all, 

688
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,970
but i will forever dream about the lady tang.

689
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,760
* oh, hey.I...

690
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,330
Didn't know you were coming by.

691
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,640
Sarah, you know when you think you're going to die, 

692
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,650
and your whole life is supposed to flash in  Front of you?

693
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,670
That didn't exactly happen for me yesterday.

694
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,520
In fact, mostly it was just a list...

695
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,870
That i saw.

696
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:32,190
A list of stuff that i haven't done and 
things that i haven't had a chance to say.

697
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,340
So today...

698
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,500
Today, i want to start crossing things off of my list.

699
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,870
And this is the first thing that i promised myself that i'd do.

700
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,890
We need to break up.

701
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,800
What?

702
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,570
You know, you know, like, fake-fake break up our pretend relationship.

703
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,030
I just can't do this anymore, you know?

704
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,530
The longer we go, the longer we keep trying to fool people 
into believing that we're a real  Couple...

705
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,800
T person i keep fooling the most is me.

706
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,090
Yeah.

707
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,120
I meant to ask you.

708
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,710
When you were affected, d you say anything to compromise yourself?

709
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,730
Uh...No.

710
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,350
But if i hadn't been trained to withstand pentathol, i might have.
