1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,034
Hey, I'm Chuck.
Here's a couple of things

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,233
you might need to know
or maybe you just forgot.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,334
I had a fiancÃ©e.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,601
<i>Now, she thinks I'm dead.</i>

5
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>Alex.
You got a daughter, Casey.</i>

6
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,300
Do you think Ellie's happy
in your marriage? Of course.

7
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:13,133
Why? Did she say something?

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,500
This is about your
father, Ellie.

9
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:15,934
There are some
very bad people

10
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,300
looking for him,
including a man named

11
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,567
<i>John Casey.</i>

12
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:22,968
I knew it! You downloaded
the Intersect 2.0.

13
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:25,634
The Intersect...
it can have a negative affect

14
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,367
on the brain.

15
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,034
Your dreams are
all proof of stress

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,434
likely leading to serious

17
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,334
<i>mental deterioration.</i>

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,767
<i>So, what did you want</i>

19
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,034
to tell me?
Is it about the doctor?

20
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,934
He said that... I'm fine.

21
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,634
Wait a minute,
you dreamt Shaw was alive?

22
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,267
<i>Chuck, you saw him die.</i>

23
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,534
I call it the Governor.

24
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:45,901
It governs my neural network

25
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:48,001
and helps control the
power of the Intersect.

26
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:49,968
<i>Could something like that
work for the 2.0?</i>

27
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,968
It will. I'm going
to make you one.

28
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,467
So, how's everything, uh,
how's everything coming?

29
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,267
Same as the last
time you asked me.

30
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,567
Can I get you anything,
like a, like a juice?

31
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:03,901
Or coffee?

32
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:05,300
Maybe a breakfast sandwich?

33
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,068
I'm fine, Charles.
Just relax.

34
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,934
"Relax." That's good.

35
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:10,467
That's... that's good.

36
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:12,334
Dad, is this really
going to work?

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,233
This whole,
this whole Governor thingy?

38
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,001
I'm still alive, aren't I?

39
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:17,767
Look, based on
the schematics

40
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,867
of my own Governor,
I'm going to create

41
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,001
a new one that'll
help control

42
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:22,400
the Intersect 2.0 before...

43
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,068
Before what?
Before I go nuts?

44
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,667
Because that's exactly
what the Ring wants.

45
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:27,367
Son, your brain is working fine

46
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,068
so far, right?
Who wouldn't be

47
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,001
paranoid in your shoes?
Your cover's blown,

48
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:32,867
your secret base discovered,
your dead partner

49
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,701
and girlfriend's ex-lover
was a double agent.

50
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,100
Way to talk me down, Dad.

51
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:38,934
What I, what I'm trying
to say is...

52
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,534
Your courage makes me
very proud.

53
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,734
But there's some battles

54
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,867
you have to walk away from.

55
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,400
What are you saying- run?

56
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:51,801
Turn my back

57
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:53,701
on everyone that I care about?

58
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:57,200
There may come a time when
if you want to protect them...

59
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,300
...you have to go.

60
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,034
Go where?

61
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,034
Vacation.

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,734
Dad was just saying
that he thinks

63
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,034
I might need to get out
of here and take a little break.

64
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,801
Well, he's right. You've
been a little nervous lately.

65
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,233
So, is this what you two

66
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,634
have been working on?
Yeah.

67
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,534
Little family heirloom
Dad's just

68
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,701
sprucing up for me.

69
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,834
Well, I'm su
he doesn't need you

70
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,001
looking over his shoulder.

71
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:21,300
You could use some fresh air.

72
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:22,901
She's right, Charles.

73
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,968
Smell the roses.
I'd really rather not, Dad.

74
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,934
Seasonal allergies-
you know, runs in the family.

75
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,100
Listen to the man.

76
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,767
He knows what's
best for you.

77
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,367
Need any help?

78
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,634
Dude? You don't look
so hot, buddy.

79
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,567
I mean, compared to your
normal level of hotness.

80
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:41,968
Lost a little sizzle.

81
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,267
I'm looking for my wife, Morgan.

82
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:45,200
She didn't come
home last night.

83
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,334
You don't say?

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,767
I do say.

85
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,934
Why would I know where Ellie is?

86
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,001
Why'd you think there was

87
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,068
something wrong
with our marriage?

88
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,834
No reason.

89
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,167
You know, I just kind of...

90
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,267
Don't B.S. me, little man.

91
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,968
If something is
up with Ellie,

92
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:58,834
I want to know about it now.

93
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:00,767
Oh, boy.

94
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,701
She's having an affair.

95
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,267
She's cheating
on you, bro.

96
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,133
What? That's impossible.

97
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,467
Casey intercepted an illicit

98
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:09,901
phone message, and
he played it for me.

99
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:11,200
What? Ellie would never...

100
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:12,267
Devon...

101
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,001
Whoa.
I'm sorry.

102
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,634
You just called me "Devon."

103
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:18,034
Yeah, well, this is
no time for frivolity.

104
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,133
I really need to see you.

105
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,300
Devon thinks that I'm

106
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,534
at the hospital.
It's just, it's getting

107
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:24,701
harder and harder to lie.

108
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,500
I know.

109
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,068
How could she do this to us?

110
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,734
I need to call my wife.
Yeah.

111
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,968
I gotta get in on
some of this Ellie action.

112
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:41,334
That is why I choose
not to get married.

113
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,734
That's why I ward them off.

114
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,133
Hey, I need to
call my husband.

115
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,567
It's weird,
I'm not getting a signal.

116
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:53,133
It's blocked.

117
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,300
We can't have enemy operatives

118
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,534
like John Casey
tracking you here.

119
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,667
He's on the loose?
I thought... He had

120
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:58,634
fled by the time our team
got to your apartment.

121
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:01,500
I have to call Chuck.
I have to protect him.

122
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,034
Ellie...

123
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,267
We're in the process of
bringing your brother in.

124
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,567
You're safe here,
and John Casey knows better

125
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,200
than to show his face
anytime soon.

126
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,200
One apple pie

127
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,601
and one cup of coffee.

128
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,334
Black and bitter.

129
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,001
Actually, I didn't order yet.

130
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:19,834
I know. I ordered
for you. It's easy.

131
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,167
You always get
the same thing.

132
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,867
And you always sit in the
same seat facing the door.

133
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:26,133
Creature of habit.
What can I say?

134
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,034
What happened to your face?
Hmm?

135
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,767
Kitchen accident.
It's nothing.

136
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,634
Hey, how'd that, uh,

137
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,034
criminal psych final
of yours go? Good.

138
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,434
Piece of cake. I'm all set
to graduate next week.

139
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,934
Oh. It's like your days
of slinging pie are numbered.

140
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,334
Don't worry.
I'll make sure

141
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,300
the next girl
gets your order right.

142
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,133
You won't even miss me, John.

143
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,601
Thanks, Alex.

144
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:58,467
All of these people, any of
whom could be Ring agents.

145
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,434
Oh, come on. You've got to
switch off your spy mode.

146
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,100
You're going to drive
yourself crazy.

147
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,034
Yeah, well, I've been down
that road before, haven't I?

148
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,867
Well, the CIA shrink said

149
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:08,667
that you have nothing to
worry about, remember? Right.

150
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,734
Other than the Ring
trying to kill my father

151
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:14,267
or me imaging that Shaw
is still out there and trying

152
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,500
to kill me.
Look, your father is safe.

153
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,267
And not only that, but
he is here with you,

154
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,601
which is great.
And Shaw?

155
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,467
Shaw is dead.

156
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,434
Look, I know what
you went through,

157
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,068
but you really have to
start putting it behind you.

158
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,334
What if I can't?

159
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,334
Mmm, then there is always
blueberries.

160
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,434
How is this possibly
suppose to make...?

161
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,734
Oh, my God, these are
amazing blueberries.

162
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,334
Mm-hmm. Wait till you
try them with cream.

163
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,734
Mm, be right back.

164
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,100
What?

165
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,467
Beautiful day, isn't it?

166
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,968
<i>Beautiful day, isn't it?</i>

167
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,300
Well, you have
a good one.

168
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,767
Thank you.

169
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,434
Oh, God...

170
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,701
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

171
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,133
Sorry.

172
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,133
Sa...

173
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,467
* *

174
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,901
Excuse me.

175
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,634
I must be losing my mind.

176
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:04,129
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

177
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:41,001
You're sure this isn't just another
one of your Intersect dreams?

178
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,834
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am sure.

179
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,333
Okay, Shaw is alive.

180
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
It was like he
was taunting me.

181
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,801
We have to call Beckman.

182
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,134
I already tried.
Her assistant said

183
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,367
that she's "indisposed."

184
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:50,567
"Indisposed"?

185
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:51,801
What is that suppose to mean?

186
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,934
Th-The guy that I killed
is back from the dead.

187
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,667
A guy who, keep in mind,
is a Ring operative,

188
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:57,767
who knows our covers, where
we live, where Castle is.

189
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:00,934
What station did you see him in?
North Hollywood. Why?

190
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:04,201
The time?
Maybe half an hour ago.

191
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:05,268
North or southbound?

192
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,467
South.

193
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:09,433
Any of this look familiar?

194
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,101
Are you kidding?
It's Bartowski running

195
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,534
around like a chicken
with its head cut off.

196
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,534
Slow it down.

197
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,034
Punch in.

198
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,634
Right there, Dad.

199
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,168
Oh, my God. Daniel.

200
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,400
Uh, do we know what
station he got off at?

201
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,734
One sec. Let me run the
facial recognition software.

202
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:34,934
Hollywood and Western.

203
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,567
Bingo.
Where did he exit?

204
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,268
There he is.

205
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,901
What the hell is he doing?

206
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,467
We need to follow Shaw
and take him down.

207
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,600
Yeah, that's one way
of looking at it.

208
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,734
The other option is, they're
leading you into a trap.

209
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:53,101
It's not like
we're going in empty-handed.

210
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,268
You know how I feel

211
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,634
about this, Charles.
Yeah.

212
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,268
Yeah, I do,
but I don't have a choice.

213
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,700
That's exactly what
the Ring wants you to think.

214
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:01,801
There's always

215
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,433
a choice.
What choice would that be, Dad?

216
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,234
To run away?
I'm not you, okay?

217
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,367
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life in hiding.

218
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:11,134
I can't leave the
ones I love behind.

219
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,634
Let's go.

220
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,134
* *

221
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you...?

222
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,433
...doing here, man?

223
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,101
My life is over.

224
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,500
My wife has given herself
to another man.

225
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:34,534
Hey, your wife has

226
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,134
given you a pass.

227
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,500
You're now free
to go out and mount

228
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,500
whomever you want wish to.

229
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,234
If he's been doing

230
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,168
more mounting, he wouldn't
be in this situation.

231
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:45,034
You think that my wife
is unfaithful to me

232
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,001
because I'm not satisfying her?

233
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,367
Son, while you're
wasting your time

234
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,001
at the gym or the hospital,

235
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,500
your wife is at home alone,
unoccupied.

236
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,567
So, she hired herself
a pinch hitter.

237
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:56,001
Still can't believe

238
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,567
that your missus is taking on
new customers.

239
00:09:58,634 --> 00:09:59,934
It's my dream come true.

240
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,333
Ellie is exactly like Chuck,
but with lady parts.

241
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,168
Okay. I'm going to go now.

242
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,967
Whoa, whoa. Come on.

243
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:08,001
That's the spirit, son.

244
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,268
Show the old lady

245
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,567
you know how to swing that bat.

246
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:12,067
Nice work, guys- awesome.

247
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:13,767
What?
No, not you, Awesome.

248
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:16,134
That's awesome.

249
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:21,333
General, I want to thank you
in advance for your testimony.

250
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,634
Now, it's my understanding
that, uh, you've been in charge

251
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,634
of the Intersect project
ever since it accidentally

252
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,268
was put into a civilian-
a one Charles Bartowski.

253
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
Is that correct?

254
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,400
Yes, sir. That is correct.

255
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,700
Is it also correct that
the project has fallen

256
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,034
well short of its
original expectations?

257
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,367
Yes, sir. Also correct.

258
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,034
But if I may add,
Agents Bartowski,

259
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,634
Walker and Colonel Casey
have proven

260
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,467
<i>to be an excellent
albeit unorthodox team.</i>

261
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,268
Your mission is to
grab Shaw or kill him,

262
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,500
whichever's quicker.

263
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,500
Hey, open sesame.

264
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,367
Okay, we'll split up.
Each take a floor.

265
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay.

266
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:41,067
<i>General Meriwether,
Members of the Tribunal,</i>

267
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,367
<i>you must understand,</i>

268
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:45,867
Agent Bartowski has in many ways
exceeded expectations.

269
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:49,901
I am not denying that the road
has been long and rocky.

270
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:53,168
but after three years,
Charles Bartowski is poised

271
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:56,268
to become the weapon we have
always dreamed of.

272
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,367
Justin, what's going on?

273
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,567
We've been breached.

274
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,367
It's Casey, isn't it?
Don't worry.

275
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:10,767
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you, Ellie.

276
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,801
We can handle
John Casey.

277
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,500
You're supposed to be upstairs.

278
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,367
Searched the whole floor.
Nobody here.

279
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,101
There's something wrong
with this place.

280
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:24,367
Hey, look. It's a government-
grade biometric scanner.

281
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,600
You'll never get through that.

282
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,767
Come on.
Let's go!

283
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,867
Casey, this is not a Ring base.

284
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,268
It's one of ours.

285
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,234
We've got to go find Chuck.

286
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,700
Justin...

287
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,101
Justin?

288
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,268
Chuck?

289
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,734
Ellie? Ellie, what are you
doing here?

290
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,567
<i>What are you doing here?!</i>

291
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:29,100
You just punched
a person. Chuck,

292
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,267
I thought you quit
kung fu in the third grade.

293
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,701
I... Look, I'll explain later.
Right now we have

294
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:35,067
to get out of here.

295
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:36,933
Come on. No, Chuck,
you don't understand.

296
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,467
You've been brought here
for your protection.

297
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:39,933
Justin is my CIA handler.

298
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,634
CIA handler?

299
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:42,768
<i>You don't understand, okay?</i>

300
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,367
This guy is not CIA. Everyone

301
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,534
Security! in this building
works for an evil organization.

302
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:49,134
Chuck, wait!

303
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:55,701
In conclusion, General,
I would stake my reputation

304
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,034
on the success
of Agent Bartowski.

305
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:06,301
As you were saying,
General Beckman?

306
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,833
What the hell are you doing,
Bartowski?!

307
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,034
Chuck, what the
hell is going on?

308
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,967
Apparently, I have no idea.

309
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,000
Where's my sister?

310
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,267
She's being escorted back
to her residence.

311
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,833
What was she doing her

312
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,534
You are dismissed.

313
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:36,301
General, what the hell
is going on?

314
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:42,301
I don't know how else
to explain it, Chuck,

315
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:43,867
but all our ass...

316
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,367
<i>careers are on the line.</i>

317
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,067
The committee is here

318
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:49,467
to determine if the Intersect
project is a liability.

319
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:51,000
Liability? Let me talk to them.

320
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,267
Shaw is somewhere
in this building.

321
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,034
We saw him.
If there is one thing

322
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,134
you can do to protect
the Intersect project,

323
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,067
it's keep your mouth shut.

324
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,668
Agents Walker, Casey
and Bartowski,

325
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,267
it's been brought to this
committee's attention

326
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,833
the Intersect is unstable,
expensive,

327
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,933
and most of all, dangerous.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,933
That's outrageous.

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,100
Sit down, Chuck!

330
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:11,234
I'm sorry, General.

331
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:13,833
General, this is crazy.

332
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,734
Provide one shred of evidence.
Who said this?

333
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,867
I did.

334
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,933
Hello, Chuck.

335
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,900
Sarah.

336
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,467
Shaw?

337
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,933
Ladies and gentleman,

338
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,100
this man that stands before you
is a Ring operative.

339
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,100
He kidnapped me and he drugged
me and he tried to kill me!

340
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,534
All of that is
completely true,

341
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,134
except for the
killing part.

342
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,967
In fact, I was sanctioned
by this committee.

343
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,200
Why was I not apprised

344
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:51,267
of this,
General Meriwether?

345
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:52,601
Continue, Agent Shaw.

346
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:56,234
I was acting as a double agent,
working within the Ring.

347
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,601
That is, until Chuck shot me.

348
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,701
He's lying! Do not listen
to a word that he says!

349
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:01,734
I came here today

350
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,900
to make one thing
perfectly clear.

351
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:06,567
Charles Bartowski
is an American hero.

352
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,668
He didn't ask for the Intersect.

353
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:11,734
And it's not Chuck's fault
that his brain is deteriorating.

354
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,267
Excuse me,
Agent Bartowski was given

355
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:15,000
a full psychological exam,
and he was

356
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,501
<i>cleared for all field work.</i>

357
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,967
Sarah...

358
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,501
Do you want to tell her
the truth or should I?

359
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,501
What is he talking
about, Chuck?

360
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,867
Dr. Dreyfus's report.

361
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,833
"The subject's mental decline

362
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,134
"is both inevitable

363
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,100
"and irreversible.

364
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,567
"Agent Bartowski's mind
will soon succumb to paranoia,

365
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:35,434
dementia, psychosis,
possibly worse."

366
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:37,134
I can understand why

367
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,267
your boyfriend didn't want
to worry you.

368
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,167
Sarah, I was gonna tell you.

369
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:45,267
It's my recommendation

370
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:47,701
that the Intersect project
be aborted.

371
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:51,367
Before any decisions are made,
this committee

372
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:55,467
<i>needs to review the Intersect's
successful missions.</i>

373
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:58,534
Hugo Panzer: taken out
by Bartowski's team

374
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,800
with a combination of a fencing
foil, nunchuks and turbulence.

375
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:07,200
Alexis White died while trying
to elude capture from...

376
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,967
Guys, Casey, Sarah...

377
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,000
Zip it, Bartowski.
Figure a way out later.

378
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,701
No, he's, he's,
he's an Intersect!

379
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:23,134
Daniel Shaw is
an Intersect!

380
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Sit down, Agent Bartowski!

381
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,234
It's okay, General.

382
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:27,401
I'm glad
you're seeing this.

383
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,034
See? He's not in control.

384
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,534
I'm in complete control.

385
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,401
I realize that what
I'm about to do right now

386
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:35,900
might come across as being
some kind of insane gesture

387
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,267
or maybe a completely
insane gesture,

388
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,701
but because I am
in fact saying,

389
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:40,534
and I am certain that

390
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,833
Daniel Shaw is an Intersect,

391
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,734
I'm just gonna have
to prove it to you.

392
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:47,000
Chuck, no!

393
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,601
You're supposed to catch it!

394
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,301
Guards, remove Mr. Bartowski!

395
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:57,501
No! He's an Intersect!

396
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,100
Sarah, I'm sorry.

397
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,668
These proceedings are adjourned
until further notice.

398
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,301
We gotta get out
of here.

399
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,501
We walked
into a trap.

400
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,367
What about Chuck?
Nothing we can do for him.

401
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,301
Not after that stunt. We
have to call Washington

402
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:10,967
and tell them what
is really going on.

403
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,401
Most of Washington
was in that room.

404
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,234
Shaw and the Ring have
taken over the CIA.

405
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,234
He's got the whole chain of
command eating out of his hand.

406
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,567
God only knows how many
Ring agents are on the inside.

407
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,933
It's only a matter of time
before they burn us, too.

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,900
So, what? You're just gonna run?

409
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,467
It's not just us
they're gonna come after.

410
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,601
They're gonna come after
the people we care about.

411
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,301
You coming?
No.

412
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:33,200
Everything I care about
is inside this building.

413
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:35,134
Good luck, Agent Walker...

414
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:37,434
Sarah.

415
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,734
Ellie.

416
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Devon, I need to talk to you.

417
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,434
Where have you been all night?

418
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,933
Okay, honey,
I- I need you to listen

419
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,768
to me really carefully;
I have been keeping

420
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,634
a secret from you,
and I feel horrible about it.

421
00:18:58,701 --> 00:18:59,634
No. Stop, okay?

422
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,301
I just, I don't
think I can hear

423
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:02,467
the words right now.

424
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,900
It's my fault.
It's my fault.

425
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,334
I haven't been stepping up
to the plate.

426
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:06,401
Devon, I need you to be strong.

427
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:07,833
I can be stronger.
I can superset.

428
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
I will double my workouts...

429
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:09,933
Devon, stop it!

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,933
Chuck is in trouble
with the CIA!

431
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,833
What?
Chuck,

432
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,067
our Chuck

433
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,567
punched a CIA agent

434
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:19,634
in the face today, and they
are holding him right now.

435
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,334
You mean, you haven't
been cheating on me?

436
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:23,401
What? Devon, what
are you talking about?

437
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,567
No. Listen to me.
I think

438
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:25,634
he's gonna need a lawyer.

439
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,067
No, no, Chuck has been

440
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,334
with the CIA for years.

441
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,167
I'm so glad
you finally know.

442
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,200
What a relief
it is to talk...

443
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,701
You don't know.

444
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:40,800
Oh, no, I just told you.

445
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:45,200
You are gonna tell me
everything you know right now.

446
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,334
Order's up.

447
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,833
Alex...

448
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,601
You come here for the pie,
too, Agent Casey?

449
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,267
I think it's
the best in town.

450
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,434
Hey, guy.

451
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:01,768
And you brought
a friend.

452
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,833
Table for two, please.

453
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,267
Right this way.

454
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:25,800
Sergeant Mosley, you're needed
in the conference room ASAP.

455
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:26,967
That means run.

456
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,401
Follow you where, Dad?

457
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,933
Chuck!

458
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,034
Here you go.

459
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,701
Thank you
very much.

460
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:57,167
You're welcome. Enjoy.

461
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:58,768
Pretty girl.

462
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:00,933
So much to live for.

463
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,200
Be a shame if she didn't.

464
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,567
Not hungry?

465
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:11,067
Why don't you put your hands
on the table, John?

466
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,367
Good.

467
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:21,933
Mmm.

468
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,100
Too much nutmeg.

469
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,100
You're a smart guy, John.

470
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,501
I'm sure you figured it out
by now.

471
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:31,900
You're coming with me.

472
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,234
I gotta say, John,

473
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:36,601
I never figured you for a dad.

474
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:38,601
Well, I'm not a very good one.

475
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,067
What are you doing?!

476
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm saving your life.
Put me down!

477
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,567
Hey! Ow!

478
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:53,534
Chuck, wait!

479
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:54,867
Where are you going?

480
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:55,967
Sarah, I have to leave.

481
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:57,067
My-my-my dad is coming.
Oh, you can't.

482
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:58,367
You have to stay and fight.

483
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,701
If you run, they'll
put a burn notice

484
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:01,034
on you,
and you'll be running forever.

485
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:04,768
We have to move
right now!

486
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,100
You can't do this.

487
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,800
If you run, there's a
bull's-eye on your back.

488
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,301
They will never ever
stop looking for you.

489
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,367
If you stay, everyone you love
will be in danger.

490
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,601
You have to choose who you
want to protect: you or her.

491
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:14,967
Dad, please don't leave...

492
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:19,267
Right now, Charles!

493
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:22,100
You have to run
to protect her!

494
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,467
I'm sorry, Sarah.

495
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:25,567
I'm sorry,
but if I have to choose,

496
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:27,867
I will always choose
to protect you.

497
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,867
Sorry, Alex, but this is
for your own safety.

498
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,934
You have to believe
I would never hurt you.

499
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:52,467
No, just forcibly kidnap me.

500
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:54,801
Here...

501
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:56,201
take it.

502
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:58,034
This is a key
to my locker

503
00:22:58,101 --> 00:22:59,700
at the Burbank Buy More.

504
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:02,001
Everything inside is yours now.

505
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:06,201
Look, Mr. Casey,
if you want me to hear you,

506
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,500
I'd step out of the car and talk

507
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,168
so that I don't feel like
my life is in jeopardy.

508
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,333
Please?

509
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:21,001
Okay.

510
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:29,500
Alex, wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! No, no, no, no...

511
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,867
Wait! Come on!

512
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:36,067
I got an A
in my self-defense class!

513
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:38,700
Alex...

514
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,367
Alex, I'm your father.

515
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,667
That's impossible!

516
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:47,767
My father's dead.
He was a war hero.

517
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:50,268
He died before
I was even born.

518
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,268
No, I didn't.

519
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,600
Stop it.

520
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,600
You were named
after your dad, Alex.

521
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,834
You're named after me.

522
00:23:57,901 --> 00:24:00,333
My real name's Alex Coburn.

523
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,634
Please, you have to trust me.

524
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,767
You have to get
to your mom and disappear.

525
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,034
Go, Alex.

526
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:11,067
Run!

527
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,034
CIA! John Casey, put your hands
on top of your head!

528
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,101
That whole Generalissimo thing?

529
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,967
I was undercover on a mission.

530
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:32,967
That's it.

531
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:34,400
That's all I know, babe.

532
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,234
Oh, and you can
blame the CIA

533
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,433
for my bachelor party.

534
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,067
Stripper?
She was an agent.

535
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:40,333
Told you I didn't cheat.

536
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,333
Faithful.

537
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,268
I can't believe that my brother
and Sarah are spies.

538
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,268
How is my dad
involved in all this?

539
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:51,001
I, uh, have pockets
of missing knowledge.

540
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,333
I didn't want to know

541
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,767
'cause I didn't want to have

542
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,067
to lie to you, babe.

543
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,300
Devon, an actual legitimate
answer exists

544
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,801
as to why my father has
been missing my entire life,

545
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,967
and you didn't think
to ask that question?

546
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,734
Correct.

547
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,767
You need to find me somebody
who knows

548
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,834
a lot more than you do
right now.

549
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,433
Morgan Grimes,
the boy that took

550
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,767
my pillow as his date
to Junior Prom

551
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,168
knows more about my family
being spies than I do.

552
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:18,201
Here.

553
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,901
It's valerian
root tea,

554
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,667
and it'll give your brain
a lovely, soothing bath.

555
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:24,534
I don't want a soothing brain
bath, Morgan. I want answers.

556
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,201
Startling revelation,

557
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:27,667
yeah, I know.

558
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,700
Well, Chuck has been with the
Company for quite a while now.

559
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:34,500
Suffice to say all
is in hand, so...

560
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,034
No, Morgan, all is
not in hand, okay?

561
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,834
The bad guys have my brother.

562
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:39,867
Hold on a second.

563
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,634
Nobody said anything
about bad guys.

564
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,034
What bad guys? The Ring? What?

565
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,201
The Ring; a nefarious
criminal organization

566
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:48,400
hell-bent on world
domination. All I know is that

567
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,634
Justin told me that John Casey
is a double agent.

568
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,967
And he's here trying
to gather information

569
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,101
about my dad, but if
Chuck is an agent, too,

570
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:57,134
then-then maybe
Casey lied to him

571
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,168
and turned him somehow?

572
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:00,534
Our Eagle Scout Chuck

573
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,934
turned to the dark side?

574
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,967
No, not gonna happen.
And any suggestions

575
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:06,667
that Colonel Jonathan Casey's
character's in question,

576
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,333
well, I would stake my entire...

577
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,634
albeit.. okay,

578
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,834
thin reputation
on the fact that he is

579
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:14,801
Uncle Sam's
most faithful servant.

580
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,567
Fine. Then one of you

581
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:18,067
geniuses explain to me

582
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,567
why the CIA is holding my
brother against his will.

583
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:23,667
I don't know,
but I will find out.

584
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:29,534
You wanted
to see me...

585
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,667
sir?

586
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:32,234
I'd be remiss if I didn't

587
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,001
tell you you looked
great, Walker.

588
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:35,534
Love suits you, I guess.

589
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,634
Shut up, Shaw.

590
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,134
This is crap and you know it.

591
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:42,001
Only two people know what
happened that day in Paris.

592
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,534
It's your word against mine.

593
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,634
Chuck saw what happened.

594
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,333
We all know that you tried
to kill me.

595
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,333
But Chuck has become
an unreliable witness.

596
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,834
His mind has
been compromised

597
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,168
by the Intersect.

598
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,201
And now that he's escaped,
he seems so guilty.

599
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:58,001
I'm sorry that you had to learn
about his mental deterioration

600
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,867
in such a public forum.

601
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,234
Sad that he
never told you

602
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,700
in a more
intimate setting...

603
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,801
Sam.

604
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,834
You're gonna put
your hands up

605
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,667
and you're gonna walk
out that door

606
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,734
and you're gonna tell
the generals

607
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,433
exactly what happened in Paris.

608
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,367
So move it.

609
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:18,500
I knew you'd bite.

610
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:23,067
Drop it, Agent Walker!

611
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:26,001
Arrest her.
She's gone rogue.

612
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,634
It's a shame.

613
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,534
I remember when nothing
affected you.

614
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,767
Now you're as emotional
as your boyfriend.

615
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:47,400
Sarah and Casey will know
how to help Chuck, okay?

616
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:49,567
You just go check the
dojo. There's a dojo?

617
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:53,101
General Beckman?

618
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,134
Where's Bartowski?

619
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:55,801
I'd hoped to find him in Castle.

620
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:58,433
I think there's been some
sort of mix-up. Chuck is being

621
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,168
held by the CIA. Maybe you could
actually help clear this up.

622
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:02,634
This is great. General
Beckman, open the door.

623
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,634
General, what's happening?

624
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,734
Open the door right now!

625
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,433
They're shutting down

626
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,201
the entire Intersect project,
including myself.

627
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:09,600
They apprehended Colonel Casey.

628
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,934
Agent Walker is in
custody. Bartowski

629
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:14,168
escaped this facility;
he is a wanted man.

630
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,834
I need you
to find him.

631
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,268
As much as it pains me

632
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,067
to admit,
you are our only hope!

633
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,001
You are our only hope!

634
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:28,433
Get your hands off me!

635
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,967
Dude, did she mean
you or me?

636
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,600
* *

637
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:47,034
Finished it.

638
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,433
Your Governor.

639
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,967
* *

640
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,333
It will activate
immediately.

641
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:06,101
Better?

642
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:10,834
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

643
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,300
Cell? That's not off
the grid, Charles.

644
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:19,201
Dad, it's, it's Morgan.
I never got a chance

645
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,201
to say good-bye to him.

646
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:21,201
Hey, buddy,

647
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:22,400
listen, I gotta go away.

648
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,067
I gotta go on a trip
with my dad,

649
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:26,234
and, and I could be gone
for a really long time.

650
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,667
Yeah, well, stop.
Sarah's in CIA custody.

651
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:29,667
Casey has been taken.
I think they got Beckman, too.

652
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,934
What? When did this
happen? Hey, Dad! No!

653
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:34,634
Dad! Dad, we have
to go back.

654
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,634
Shaw has got Sarah!
And that's no accident!

655
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,634
He doesn't want her;
he's trying to trap you.

656
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,801
He's after this.

657
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:44,500
I'm your father;
you cannot ask me.

658
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:47,234
Please do not ask me to put
my own son in jeopardy.

659
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,333
I can't just walk away, Dad!

660
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,101
Why did you come back this time?

661
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:53,400
You came back
because you wanted

662
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:54,567
to protect Ellie
and me.

663
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,767
Because you knew no matter
how far you ran,

664
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,967
you could never live with
yourself if something happened

665
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:00,333
to somebody that you loved.

666
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,667
* *

667
00:30:05,534 --> 00:30:06,534
If we do this...

668
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:10,234
we gotta be smart.

669
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,600
Not think emotional!

670
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:15,767
We can do this.

671
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:16,967
We're Bartowskis.

672
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:26,333
Ellie.

673
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,834
Chuck, I thought

674
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:32,001
that the CIA still had you.
I wish I had time to explain.

675
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:33,234
You know what, Chuck?

676
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,901
It takes just as long to say
that as to tell me

677
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,333
what the hell is going on.

678
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,467
We need your help.

679
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,300
Who's we, Chuck? The government?

680
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:41,367
The answer is no.

681
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:44,168
<i>No, we need your help.</i>

682
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:47,901
Dad? I thought that you left.

683
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:50,101
El, I know
you got a lot

684
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:51,767
of questions,
but right now

685
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:54,467
you have the answers
that we need.

686
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:58,300
This is it.

687
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,333
This is where
I would meet Justin.

688
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,168
This is our
rendezvous point.

689
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:04,333
There's got
to be more to it, okay?

690
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,801
Shaw has to have
another location.

691
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:07,034
This can't be
a dead end.

692
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:08,367
What are you two
whispering about?

693
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,834
No more secrets.

694
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,567
May-maybe you're forgetting
something.

695
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:12,834
Walk us through
what would happen

696
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:13,867
when you met Justin.

697
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:15,234
I don't know, Dad,
this is it.

698
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,867
I would, I would sit here
on this bench and we would talk.

699
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:19,600
And then he'd
get up, he'd leave.

700
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,567
He'd go over there.

701
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,467
Through that door.

702
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:24,534
The subway again.

703
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,168
Hey, we need you
to stay here, okay?

704
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,467
You just stay
right here on this bench.

705
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:33,801
If we're not back
in 20 minutes, run.

706
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:36,901
Dad, I need
to hear you say it.

707
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:40,634
I need to know that there's
a reason that you left us.

708
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,634
It's a long story.

709
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,300
I want to tell you everything,
but I gotta,

710
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,667
I gotta take care
of this first, okay?

711
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,700
This is the last time

712
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:56,534
I'm gonna walk
away from you.

713
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,567
I promise.

714
00:31:58,634 --> 00:32:00,567
I love you, baby.

715
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:14,534
You're not gonna
get away with this, Shaw.

716
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,367
Yes, I will.

717
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:19,034
Love-soaked Bartowski
will try to come save you,

718
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,467
and this time
I'll be ready

719
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:21,667
<i>for him and
his father.</i>

720
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,700
Mu-ha-ha.

721
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,134
Over here. Over here.

722
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,067
Dad...

723
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:45,667
This control panel
was manufactured

724
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:46,700
by McTiernan Industries.

725
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,967
It's a Ring subsidiary.

726
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,134
Fake wall.

727
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:00,567
Aces, Charles.

728
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,400
All right.

729
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,834
Shaw, Bartowski's
infiltrated the base.

730
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:23,333
Of course he did.

731
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,134
Why won't your boyfriend
ever think

732
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:26,801
with an organ besides his heart?

733
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:29,268
No, sir, not this one.

734
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,867
Bartowski and his father
found the other base,

735
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,067
the Ring base.

736
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:33,500
Triggered
the silent alarm.

737
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,934
Damn it.

738
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:43,700
Hmm. Don't know
when it happened,

739
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:45,234
but our boy
became a man.

740
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,168
Bartowski's a spy.

741
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,934
Picked a good
one, Walker...

742
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,934
finally.

743
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,500
Oh, my God.

744
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:07,134
Dad, this is what I've
been having dreams about.

745
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:09,134
Dr. Kowambe's medical
experiments;

746
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:10,567
cellular regeneration.

747
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:16,767
It's identical. They did it.

748
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:19,201
I can't believe
the Ring built one.

749
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,767
They must have saved
Shaw's life, and then...

750
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:25,268
and then turned him
into an Intersect.

751
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,567
I was right.

752
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,134
Dad, the lab is all
the proof that we need.

753
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:45,300
It'll vindicate my team,
Shaw will be exposed.

754
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:48,467
Exposed? Exposed as what,
uh, the Intersect?

755
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:51,934
I see you got a fancy
new watch there, Chuck.

756
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:53,734
Do you mind

757
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,934
if I try it on?

758
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,067
Why don't you come over
here and take it from me?

759
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:05,234
Actually, I think I'll have
my friend grab it for me.

760
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:17,801
I don't need a watch
to beat you, Shaw.

761
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,634
Come on.
Aren't you a little curious?

762
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,134
I know I am.

763
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,134
Don't you want

764
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:27,500
to know how your Intersect
stacks up against mine?

765
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:29,268
You're right, Chuck.

766
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,834
The fight will be incredible.

767
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,201
We're totally equal now.

768
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:33,634
Nothing separates us.

769
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,901
<i>Though... there's one thing
that is different.</i>

770
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:40,234
You can't function

771
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
when your emotions have
been compromised.

772
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,901
Don't worry about that.

773
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:47,834
I've never been more calm.

774
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:50,268
Really? How you feeling now?

775
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:05,101
* *

776
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,567
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

777
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:13,767
Dad, hey, hey, hey,
hang on! Hang on!

778
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,634
Hang on! Stay with
me! Stay with me!

779
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,734
You're gonna be okay,
okay? I promise.

780
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,500
You're special, son.

781
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:25,667
Always remember...

782
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,634
you're special.

783
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:27,934
Check out the fresh fish.

784
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,567
Wait here.

785
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:32,834
Hello, miss.

786
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:34,400
Hi.
Hi.

787
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,367
I was wondering
if I could

788
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,267
service you in some way.

789
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,934
Yes, I guess. Um...

790
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:43,901
could you tell me where I could
find John Casey's locker?

791
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:46,567
<i>What exactly is your
relationship to Mr. Casey?</i>

792
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,101
If I may be so bold.

793
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:51,034
He's my... friend,

794
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,068
and he asked me
to get something

795
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:54,467
out of his locker.

796
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:56,034
He gave me his key.

797
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:58,434
That doesn't look like
one of our keys. Shh!

798
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,534
Maybe you're talking about
a different John Casey.

799
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Ours doesn't really have
any friends.

800
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,534
Thank you, guys.
I'll take it from here.

801
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,567
Morgan Grimes,
assistant manager.

802
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:06,734
Hi. Alex.

803
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:09,200
Alex, take a walk with me?

804
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:10,867
Did you say that belongs
to John Casey?

805
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:12,567
Yes. Um, he does
work here, right?

806
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:13,901
Of course he does.
Yeah, yeah.

807
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:14,967
Who do you work for?

808
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:16,400
It's okay;
you can tell me.

809
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,901
I'm on the inside.

810
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,500
Um, the Pie Shack
in Silverlake.

811
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:20,534
Yeah, okay.
Come on.

812
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,634
Lady, please, I have

813
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,134
a very high level
of clearance, okay?

814
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,233
Listen, I can't let you walk
back there, have access

815
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,667
to John Casey's locker
without knowing what's going on.

816
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:27,734
I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

817
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:31,600
I don't know what's going on.

818
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,600
All I know is that
this customer John

819
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:36,068
kidnaps me, and then he tells me
that he's my father,

820
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:37,567
and now there's
men chasing us.

821
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:38,801
And I'm sorry. I know

822
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:40,267
that I don't
really know you.

823
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,300
I'm just a little
confused right now.

824
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,667
No, no, that's okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you upset.

825
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:46,901
Look, miss,
I promise you this:

826
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:49,267
if John Casey said he's your
father, then it's the truth.

827
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,767
I trust that man with my life.

828
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:51,934
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

829
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:53,300
<i>Not if he's your father.</i>

830
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,600
And in fact, this store's
as safe as anywhere,

831
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,300
provided you stay away
from those two.

832
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:04,300
Yeah?
Let's go see

833
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,134
what's in that locker, all
right? Are you okay? Yeah?

834
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,667
This isn't a Buy More key,
so I'll have to use mine.

835
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,701
Assistant manager.

836
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:11,867
That's why
I have this.

837
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:12,967
So you know.

838
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:21,934
Okay. Avid reader.

839
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:26,034
Oh, my. Whoa!

840
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:28,168
How long it's been
in there. Yeah.

841
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,333
Oh, check it out.

842
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:32,333
That's gonna work.

843
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,767
Oh, actually, you might
want to stand back.

844
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,134
This could explode.

845
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:41,567
Ooh... okay.

846
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,500
He said this is for you?

847
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:53,333
Yeah. What is it?

848
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:55,934
He must have been saving

849
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:58,567
for, like, ever.
We don't pay that much here.

850
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,667
Morgan, Ellie called.

851
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,068
We need to talk.

852
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:05,634
Yeah, shoot, buddy.
Whatever you got to say,

853
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:07,001
you can say
in front of her.

854
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:09,034
She's one of us.
Not this.

855
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:16,967
Try not to spend it
all in one place.

856
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:23,068
Chuck, what happened?

857
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:26,400
Are you okay?

858
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:29,701
Where's your dad?

859
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:33,233
I'm sorry, guys.

860
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,600
Shaw has won.

861
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,233
Oh, my God.

862
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,267
I'm so sorry.

863
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,400
Don't worry, buddy,
we'll get Shaw.

864
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:46,134
No, we won't.

865
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,634
Love the new defeatist
attitude, Chuck.

866
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:50,001
Suits you.

867
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:51,801
We'll be leaving
momentarily

868
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,567
for the CIA
detention facility.

869
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:56,934
These people won't be seeing
the light of day for some time.

870
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:06,434
Enjoy this ride together...
bond.

871
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,934
share all the war stories...

872
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:11,168
because as soon
as the truck stops,

873
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:12,867
so do your lives.

874
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,267
We'll figure something out.

875
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:36,168
It's over.

876
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:39,667
There is no one left to save us.

877
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:50,934
I'm following them now.

878
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:52,134
Are you ready?

879
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,333
We're ready.

880
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,901
I'm warning you, Ellie,
if we do this,

881
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,701
there is no turning back-
our lives are changed forever.

882
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,901
I'm asking one final time.

883
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:03,701
Are you sure
this is what you want?

884
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,567
Yes.

885
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:12,101
Let's do this.
