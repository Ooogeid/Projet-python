14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,530
hi.My name's  charles
bartowski,but you can call me  uck.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,980
Those are my shoes.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,480
This is my life.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,320
It's filled  with spies,car chases,computer-stealing
ninjas  and me saving the day.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,010
Oh,wait,wait. I o ed tgo back.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,510
I work at the buy more.

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,830
It used to be pretty boring.

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,460
Chuck! Get overhere! Now!

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
Look at this. What happened?

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,020
Well,wayto go,jeff.

24
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,250
You do realize we don't
workfor large mart.

25
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,140
They're our competition.

26
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:10,520
Can you imagine the shameif sommarge rt fiend or
costco stoogeput out a display on our buy more green?

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,650
So this has tocome down,right?

28
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,830
Yesterday.

29
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,250
I now present to youthe
magic... of morgan.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,100
this is my best friend,morgan.
He is not a magician.

31
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,630
Voila!

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,680
See,everything changed  when I got an e-mail
from my old college buddy  bryce larkin.

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,700
You see,bryce had been working for the cia when
he stwhe a ole bunch of government secrets--

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,430
big important secrets,really
scary,nasty,get-killed-for-having-them secrets.

35
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,930
Next thing I know,these ecpersrets
are downloaded into my brain,

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,270
which means every moment lf myife...

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,250
is in danger.

38
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,940
The nsa sent their top
agent to protect me.

40
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,280
That's casey. He's pretty scary.

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,330
He works at buy more now,cas aover.

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,340
So now I must defend the
country from assassins...

43
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,580
no,casey!

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,220
...Terrorists...  ...

45
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,770
and shoplifters.

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,570
Casey,casey,casey. No,no,no,no,no.
No,no,no,no. It's just a video game,okay?

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,610
Lives are not in danger,and
the countryis still safe.

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,670
This guy's been here24 hours and he's
taking the job waymore seriously than me.

49
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,950
That's becausehe's crazy.

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,730
Tell me somethingI don't know.

51
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,770
Oh,hey,dawg. Nice to
see you again,pal. Huh?

52
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,270
You're not so tough now,are you?

53
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,260
Oh,youdon't like that,huh?

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,450
Sarah?

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,980
The cia sent their tot,agen too.

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,740
Oh,yeah,I know. Believe me.

57
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,960
She told me to trust her.

58
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,180
But just like any
woman,she's got a past.

59
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,020
and... she's posing  as my girlfriend.

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,820
sarah,what,uh... at
awhre you doing here?

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,750
I work here now,chuck.

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,610
Oh,damn.

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,900
I burned another batch.

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,310
Why are you working here?

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,400
Surveillance.

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,580
I can monitor the buy more
from here while you work.

67
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,400
It's just a cover.

68
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,640
Right,yllh,a part of the plan.
'Cause there's a plan,right?

69
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,930
I mean,uh,you making gourmet wieners isn't
exactly the reason why you joined the cia,

70
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,940
and casey isn't a natural-born appliance salesman,and the
whole kinda government-secrets-locked- in-my-brain thing,

71
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,350
uh,that's,I'm sure,not really a boon for national security,so I'm
hoping,I mean,I'm hoping that you'll tell me that there's a plan?

72
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,980
We have a plan.

73
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,350
There is somebody who can help.

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,620
We can discuss it further tonight.

75
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,900
How about another date?
I can pick you up at 8:00.

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,970
Yeah. Yeah,that sounds... I'd like that.
That sounds great. I'll,uh,I'll see you.

77
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,280
chuck is in.

78
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,290
Send the doctor.

79
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey,sis,what do you think of this shirt?

80
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,670
Another date with sarah.
This is very exciting.

81
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,940
-Well,see,it's not that big a deal.
-Yes,it is. Hey,she is hot.

82
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,100
Jeepers.

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,140
I'd go with the first shirt,too. It
looks really nice with your skin tone.

84
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,780
Oh,yeah?

85
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,240
Wait a minute-- morgan
has met her,and I haven't?

86
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,970
Well... yeah,he confides
in me,ellie. You know?

87
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,550
He-he tells me his deepest,darkest
secrets,which,you could,too,by the way.

88
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,980
Here's one: I loath you.

89
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,270
That's not a secret.

90
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,320
I need to meet this girl.
Tomorrow night. Dinner. Here.

91
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,760
A little too soon to be seeing
the tron poster,don't you think?

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,620
Not exactly a natural aphrodisiac.

93
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,740
Dinner. Perfect. I'll clear my schedule.

94
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,910
Our most valuable secrets
have been sent to an idiot.

95
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,870
Well,at least they
weren't sent to his friend.

96
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,890
"Operation chuck.

97
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,990
" I can't believe this.

98
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,850
I spoke with agent walker.

99
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,500
She'll deliver chuck to
the rendezvous tonight.

100
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,580
Good. Dr.  Zarnow's
on his way to L.A. Now.

101
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,880
He is our best,nsa's top scientist.

102
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,650
Well,I hope he can fix this.

103
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,260
Get in.

104
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,220
Wienerlicious really pays well,huh?

105
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,740
Uh,what are we,uh,what are we doing? We're
going to,uh,like,a movie or some dinner?

106
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,670
Not exactly.

107
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,900
What,what does,what does
"not exactly" mean,exactly?

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
So.

109
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,560
Here we are on ourdate at the buy more.

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,860
Is this all partof the plan or a
chance for meto clock in some overtime?

111
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,570
There's a doctor comingto see you,chuck.

112
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,780
He worked on theencoding process for the intersect,the
computerthat bryce destroyed,the one that'sin your head.

113
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,150
He's comingto examine you.

114
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:03,800
Uh-huh,uh,and-and doesthis examination involve,say,I
don't know,needles orperhaps probing of some kind?

115
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,740
The doctor is our best
shotat helping you.

116
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,050
It's what you want,right?

117
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,790
To get the secretsout of your head.

118
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,960
Yeah. Yeah,of course.

119
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,340
But you-you still... you're still being very vagueabout
the probing,and I'd liketo know the answer to that.

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,680
We've rewired the hometheater
room for this test.

121
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,380
When the images start,just
say what they are.

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,430
That's it?

123
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,900
I'm sure you'll finda
way to screw it up.

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,210
The doctor's here.

125
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,940
- When do I getto meet him?
-You don'T.

126
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,490
It's importantthat he doesn't
see you. You're too valuable.

127
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,050
Thanks. I'm flattered
and totallyfreaked out.

128
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,900
Dr.  Zarnow?

129
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,490
Agent casey.

130
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,310
Agent walker.

131
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,800
Thank you for meetingus
at a neutral site.

132
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,700
Let's begin.

133
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,810
I don't understand whyI
can't see my patient.

134
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,160
For your safety,we're
keepingpatient x's identity a secret.

135
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,110
Does patient x work here?

136
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,620
Patient x--who knows all the
intersect secrets--works in a buy more?

137
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,820
Ridiculous. Of course.

138
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,450
After the tone,the test will begin.

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,710
uh... dog.

140
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,330
Uh,hippopotamus.

141
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,680
Fat guy.

142
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,060
Ugly building.

143
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,650
Really beautiful womanat the beach.

144
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,320
Cardinal oneis the top moscow spy
in the white house office of...

145
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,890

been approved  by the dnc,rnc and cia.

147

Benedictine agents within the vatican report...  ...assassin

150
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,420
scenario five is... okay,well,that'sjust
a picture of a turtle.

151
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,950
Your patient is phenomenal.

152
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,500
We never imagined this.

153
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,580
What didn't you imagine?

154
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,610
One person seeing
allthe intersect images.

155
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,780
All our secrets in one mind.

156
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,970
Can you remove the secrets,doctor?

157
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,770
Yes. I think I can.

158
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,050
So,did I pass the test?

159
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,530
You did great,chuck.

160
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,630
And this doctor guy--he
can fix me or...?

161
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,710
Uh,he's hopeful,yeah.

162
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,710
Okay.

163
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,050
Oh,uh,I almost forgot.

164
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,320
Uh... dinner tomorrow nightwith my
sister and her boyfriend captain awesome.

165
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,520
She really wanted to meet you.

166
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,740
Okay,well,that's a good idea.

167
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,920
Meeting the family'skind of a big step
if our relationshipwere remotely real.

168
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,590
so,uh,if this wholeexamination thing,if it
works out,then I guess...we're through,huh?

169
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,220
Uh,yeah. Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,200
-Okay. Well,good night.
-Good night.

171
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:37,630
Oh,and,uh... just so you know... um... tonight wasprobably
the best... only second dateI've been on in years.

172
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,160
Drive safe.

173
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,490
Did you see this?

174
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,660
Atwh?

175
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,050
Did you know thatbryce was dead?

176
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,040
No. No,I didn'T.

177
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,340
Well,are you okay?

178
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,630
I don't know.

179
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,470
Um... yeah,I don't know. It's crazy.

180
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,060
I,uh,I spent somuch time hating him
for getting mekicked out of stanford,

181
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,100
I don't know,really,how to feel,but
it's hard to bemad at him now.

182
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,610
I'm reallysorry,chuck.

183
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,820
Yeah,ey's cas. I'm at the scene.

184
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,280
No sign of zarnow's
body. Probably vaporized.

185
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,020
I guess those secrets are
staying in chuck's head.

186
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,690
Well... no sign of anything here.

187
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,240
It looks like we're sending
thegood doctor home in an ashtray.

188
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,110
Okay,well,I've got hot dogs to fry.

189
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,110
And I've got some toastersto sell.

190
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,500
Feels like a cia job to me.

191
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,170
Keep your eye on agent walker.

192
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,740
And don't let chuck out of
your sight. He could be next.

193
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,280
The strong barsare getting
a little sticky. On... on one.

194
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,030
On theother one,it's
fine,but on the second...

195
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,500
you can't trust her.

196
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,390
-Chuck. John.
-Big mike. Big mike!

197
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,270
How's customer service training?

198
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,200
-Fine.
-Super.

199
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,660
Glad to hear it.

200
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,670
The better my employees,the
less I have to work.

201
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,070
Very inspiring words,sir.

202
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,590
Regular call to arms.

203
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,700
Well,go make 'em better.

204
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,040
Show me you're
assistantmanager material.

205
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,820
Chop-chop! I got a napin an hour.

206
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,810
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

207
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,660
So,uh,this isthe hand-held scanner.

208
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,540
Very expensivepiece of equipment.

209
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,110
So is a stealth fighter
andsomehow I managed to fly that.

210
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,230
Right,uh,and the gun,you
know,kind of works like A...

211
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,800
-gun?
-Uh-huh.

212
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,890
And it beepswhen you scan the barcodes.

213
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,260
well,if screamed out
loud,I'd be right at home.

214
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,510
:N't I dowant you to have any more
private meetingswith sarah,hmm?

215
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,820
Um,is there...is there a problem?

216
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,250
No problems,only solutions.

217
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:08,010
well,that... sounds very much likethe buy more customer
policy that I've noticedyou have some issue with.

218
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,570
Anowyou kn,uh... you know what
I thinkwe're gonna do about that?

219
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,570
We're gonna dosome role-playing,and work
on that attitude of yours how about that?

220
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,170
-Hey,morgan.
-Hi,yo.

221
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,870
Ah,hey,there he is. There's

You're gonna be a shopper,and you're

224
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,930
And,uh,I'm gonnatalk to big mike and-and work onsome

225
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,840
Got it from here.

226
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,240
there you go.

227
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,110
so,chuck,no private
meetingswith casey today.

228
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,490
What? What is it upwith you guys?

229
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,270
Did he tell youthe same thing?

230
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,370
Right,of course he did.

231
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,600
Hold on a second. Is something wrong?

232
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,680
The doctorfrom last night-- he was killed
in an explosionsoon after he left us.

233
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,930
Wha-what?

234
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,200
The doctor who wassupposed to fix me?

235
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Tell me what this is.

236
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,730
A... a nasty...

237
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,660
nsa incinerator.

238
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,290
Special issue designed
toeliminate all biological traces.

239
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,170
That's what killed the doctor.

240
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,170
And guess who worksfor the nsa?

241
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,610
-Why... why,why would casey...
- he's a killer,chuck.

242
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,080
It's what he doesfor a living.

243
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,850
He tried to kill us,and he'll
probably try to do it again.

244
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,130
Maybe it was orders.

245
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,630
Maybe he didn't like  the
way zarnow looked at him.

246
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,900
Oh,that's nice. I feel
much better now,sarah.

247
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,110
What am I supposed to do?

248
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,010
You go back in there and you
pretend likeyou know nothing.

249
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,700
Go. You can do that,chuck.

250
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,000
I know nothing.

251
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,470
I know nothing,I... got it.

252
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,260
All right,so I'm gonna try again. Ready?

253
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,820
Do you have any ramones?

254
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,780
No,don't say no. It's
not gonna...listen,okay.

255
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,470
Uh,excuse me,john. How you doing?
Do you have any ramoneshere,dude?

256
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,220
Don't tell meyou don't have any.

257
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,800
Casey,the...the correct response
is "can we order youthe ramones?

258
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,850
" Ramones,man,ramones. Okay,just
lookingfor the ramones,man.

259
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,950
Do you have ramones?
'Cause I love ramones... ow!

260
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,240
That's a "no"on the ramones,I guess.

261
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,800
Okay,I don't thinkthat's
in the buy more manual.

262
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,050
What did sarah tell you?

263
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,120
I know you talked to her.
It's what I dofor a living.

264
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,810
oh,no,here it is,on the
bottom shelf: Ramones.

265
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,820
-There you go.
-Thanks.

266
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,050
-Bye.
-I love you.

267
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,470
What did you tell chuck?

268
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,270
That you're a
cold-bloodedkiller. Was I lying?

269
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,320
No.

270
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,120
The way I figure it,the only two people that
knew the doctorwas coming are right here.

271
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,610
Since I didn't cap
him,you're under arrest.

272
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,440
quick,take a pic.

273
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,990
She's so hot. Did you get it? Come on.

274
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,940
Let's go put iton the internet.

275
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,830
-Mr.  Bartowski.
-Hi lester.

276
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,430
Uh,code zebra.

277
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,570
Linux install at afactory
off ventura. 142 euclid.

278
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,640
Uh... I'm sorry. Why-why
can't you and jeff go?

279
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,590
linux,pcs? We're,uh,we're mac
guys,chuck. We're... we're it artists.

280
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,320
Okay. Yeah. Uh... fine,whatever.

281
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,570
I'll be back in half an hour.

282
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,460
And,uh,just tell
caseythat I'm on my cell.

283
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,810
You tell him. I'm not your servant.

284
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,990
-Okay,youknow what...
- no,no,I mean,I'm gonna tell him.

285
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,760
I just,you know,I mean,in
general,I don't always...

286
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,480
absolutely,I'm going to...
right now,should I tell him?

287
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,460
-hello?
-Pull over.

288
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,760
Well,I can't pull over.

289
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,040
-I have a home install at,uh...
-142 euclid?

290
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,090
Guess who called that in?

291
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,200
Oh,my god. It was you!

292
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,230
You killed the doctor,and
now you're here to kill me!

293
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,690
are you out of your mind?

294
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,750
What... what... what...
what happened to you?

295
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,610
Your girlfriend happened.

296
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,060
-What,who,sarah?
-She's rogue,chuck.

297
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,190
She killed the doctor,then
she tried to kill me.

298
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,470
Is she okay?

299
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,660
Yeah,I'm golden. Thanks for asking.

300
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,920
No,no,no,why should I believe you?

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,430
She showed me the bomb.
She saidyou did it.

302
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,170
Nsa incinerator,right?

303
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,420
It's a niceexplosive easily
purchasedon the black market.

304
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,190
What do you really
knowabout sarah,chuck,huh?

305
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,180
Think.

306
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,320
She's cia.

307
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,800
She workedwith bryce.

308
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,910
He was rogue. Maybe she is,too.

309
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,020
She found you in L.A.

310
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,840
,But she couldn't grab
you because I was around.

311
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,710
So she had to wait her chance.

312
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,600
Dr.  Zarnow screwed that up.

313
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,960
He could pull those secrets out of your head,then
she loses the intersect,so she had to act fast.

314
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,600
let's go. Come on.

315
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,160
thought I turnedthat off.

316
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,440
Well,it's not me. Is it yours?

317
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,630
no.

318
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,910
nsa incinerator! Run!

319
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,760
casey! Casey!

320
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,090
You're nervouscooking,babe. Relax.

321
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,150
Devon,this dinnerhas to go well.

322
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,720
It's going to be awesome.
You don't know chuck.

323
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,990
He freaks outwhen he likes a girl.

324
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,280
Yeah,ain't thatthe truth,huh?

325
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,130
You know practicemakes perfect.

326
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,410
How did you get in here?

327
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,110
Uh,chuck's window.

328
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,520
Or,as I like to callit,the morgan door.

329
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,340
I got to lock the window.
I wonder wherechuck is.

330
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,870
Still thinkit was me?

331
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,460
:Why would sarah do this?

332
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,770
She's cleaningthe operation.

333
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,680
:Cleaning?

334
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,270
Eliminating everyoneshe's
come in contact with.

335
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,210
You know where she is?

336
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,700

She's having dinnerwith us tonight.

337
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,380
No,kid,you're on the
next plane to washington.

338
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,970
-But my sister...

339
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,620
You're the priority.

345
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,640
Where have you been?

346
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,020
Why?

347
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,200
You,uh,you surprisedto see me?

348
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
What?

349
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,120
-Where's casey?
-I don't know.

350
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,590
Maybe he's havingsome car trouble.

351
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,010
Everyone okay?

352
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,570
Yeah,just a little
hungry,dude. You're late.

353
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,170
And dirtyfor my taste.

354
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,890
And your girlfriend has been
just nothing but mean to me.

355
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,330
Look out for her.

356
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,750
So I'm glad everyone'sgetting
along so well.

357
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,760
Yeah,your sister is awesome.

358
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,250
Indeed.

359
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,300
Hey! I've got an idea.

360
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,500
Why don't we actually go
out,huh,for pizzaor something,

361
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,420
someplace public,with lots
and lotsof people around?

362
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,800
Uh,chuck,I've beencooking all day.

363
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,610
Yeah,cooking pot
roast,dude,which is my favorite.

364
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,950
Manzoom,manjo. Let's eat.

365
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,130
Sit down,okay? It'll be good.

366
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,820
Lady. Looks great,baby.

367
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,660
This looksdelicious,ellie.

368
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,780
Oh,it was nothing.

369
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,090
So,sarah,let's turn this
up a notchpersonal style.

370
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,270
Tell us somethingabout yourself.

371
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,450
Well,I'm originallyfrom
D.C. I just moved here.

372
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,490
Oh,chuck hada friend from D.C.

373
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,890
A former friend.

374
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,390
You know,former because a: He was
a jerk,and b: He'S...well,he's dead.

375
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,700
The girl chuck wasdating
before you-- he stole her.

376
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,960
Ugh,I just don't know howanyone
could choose bryce over chuck.

377
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,830
hi. I'm john casey. I just moved inupstairs.
I thought I mightbring something over.

378
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,560
Ow,come in.

379
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,590
Chuck,you didn't tell meyou're
bringing another friend.

380
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,400
Hey. Hi. Yeah.

381
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,830
It totally slipped my mind that my friend,john
casey,was coming over,and we work atbuy more together.

382
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,720
Morgan,you know johnfrom buy more.

383
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,920
I was telling him we weregonna have a get-together
and that,you know,the more,the merrier.

384
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,710
You pull a stuntlike that
again,I'll kill youbefore she can.

385
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,840
You kidder.

386
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,190
Chuck,we're goingto need another chair.

387
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,840

389
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,750
Strange.

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,760

innercircle of an arms deal.

392
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,440
Killed the entire circle.

393
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,460
With a bomb?

394
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,970
We don't know.

395
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,590

00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,190
Stop!

410
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,840

Well,you know,that
soufflÈdoes look amazing.

423
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,820
You're right,honey. I can't even resist.

424
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,500
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait.

425
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,020
-Who likes magic?
-I do!

426
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,370
I know a trick.

427
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,290
Chuck... oh,chuck,what are you doing?

428
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,670
Voila!

429
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,830
0whoa,chuck,that was... 0I
knew you could do it,man.

430
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,920
Flamb?

431
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,160
chuck!

432
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,570
Chuck,look,no matterhow stressed out you
are,it is never okay to murdera woman's souffl?

433
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,240
Um,you know what? Let me talk to him.

434
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,540
Casey,hey,maybe,uh...

435
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,500
tell me exactlyey cas said.

436
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,030
Nothing. Everything's okay.

437
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,210
makeup sex. Nice.

438
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,140
what did he tell you?

439
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,160
That you killed Dr.  Zarnow and
poisoned a bunchof french diplomats.

440
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,300
They're blaming me for zarnow?

441
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,400
If you're planning on
hurtingme,even to prove a point,

442
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,870
I think you should know I have
a very low thresholdfor pain.

443
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,440
And you believe casey?

444
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,510
Tell me aboutthe french diplomats.

445
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,290
They were french assassins,and they
were after me,but I got to them first.

446
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,290
And you know what? I'm
kinda glad that I did.

447
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,690
Chuck,do you really
thinkthat my name is sarah?

448
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,660
I never asked youto believe
me. I asked youto trust me.

449
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,260
This doesn't make sense.

450
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,000
If casey didn't kill zarnow,then...

451
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,870
what are you doing?

452
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,580
I have to go right now.

453
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,420
Uh,I'm sorry.

454
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,760
I have to go,but dinn won wasderful.

455
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,930
Gotta go.Be back.

456
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,180
Yeah,well,I betterbe going,too.

457
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,690
This has beengreat.Thanks.

458
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,480
Uh... you're welcome.

459
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,960
I think that went well.

460
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,750
You know,not great,but
I think it went well.

461
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,840
So,uh,I'm gonna makea little doggy
bag and head out my morgan door.

462
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,730
How about that?

463
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,950
Sounds good? Super-duper.

464
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,030
Sarah,wait!

465
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,030
You stay inside.

466
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,290
Do what I say.

467
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,520
Do you think we were wrong?

468
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,350
Casey!

469
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,510
hey,don't move.

470
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,560
Zarnow?

471
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,670
good to see you again,agent casey.

472
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,900
oh,my god.

473
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,170
Yep,we were wrong.

474
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,940
Casey,he's got sarah.We've
got to save her.

475
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,520
Brilliant deduction,nancy drew.

476
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,920
Now pull out the tranq dart!

477
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,390
Oh,I have a very
strongaversion to needles.

478
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,250
Do it!

479
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,340
Okay,uh,here we go.

480
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,240
that was the doctor,right?
He's probably not dead?

481
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,960
And the sun sets in the west.

482
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,160
Nothing gets by you.

483
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,350
One,two,three.

484
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,110
what's he gonnado with sarah?

485
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,900
He's gonna torture her until
she tells himall about you.

486
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,550
Come on.

487
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,950
If we hurry,we can catch him.

488
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,520
All right,where are we going?

489
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,170
I laced my quicheswith microbots.

490
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,840
You're not kidding,are you?

491
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,880
I don't kid about quiche.

492
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,020
We can trace himusing the car's tracker.

493
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,330
Yeah,I think that only
comeswith the sports package.

494
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,690
We made some enhancementswhen
your car was in the shop.

495
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Got a signal.

496
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,410
Let's go.

497
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,100
Hey,casey,casey.

498
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,840
Wait a minute.

499
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,550
Why,why would hebring sarah here?

500
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,470
I don't know.

501
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,730
You wait here.

502
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,480
damn tranq dart.

503
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,060
come on.

504
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,350
Oh,god.

505
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,150
hey,wait,you idiot!

506
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,910
It's morgan.

507
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,490
He ate your quiches.

508
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,560
We're onthe wrong trail.

509
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,610
Come on.

510
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,310
I got nothing.

511
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,180
What do you meanyou got nothing?

512
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,250
Then what do we do?

513
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,840
It's over.She's gone.

514
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,690
No,no,no,no,no.

515
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,030
Okay,this is our fault.

516
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,950
We didn't believe her.

517
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,180
Now we have to save her.

518
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,640
Look,if you were a bad guy,what
would you do,fly sarah outon a plane?

519
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,140
Would you use a
boator a-a-a what?

520
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,300
Chopper.

521
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,150
Small airfieldnear the water.

522
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,800
The closest I could find.

523
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,180
Then do-do a satellite
searchusing the touch screen

524
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,680
and then maybe limit thatto airfields
that are withina certain range of us

525
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,250
and then maybe limit that by if
there's activityon the ground?

526
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,030
That's not bad.

527
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,820
Thanks.

528
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,180
Yeah,I was just kindof,you
know,spitballing,just kind oftop of my head.

529
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,480
I was thinking...found it.

530
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,610
Port of los angeles.

531
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,020
Floor it.

532
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,220
Okay.

533
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,420
This is how this is gonna work.

534
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,500
I'm gonna go over there,rescue sarah,

535
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,800
and capture Dr.Zarnow,shoot
anybody who gets in my way.

536
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,200
You,you're gonna stay here.

537
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,770
So,in this planI basically do nothing?

538
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,440
Yep.

539
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,980
Let's do this.

540
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,180
All right,all right.

541
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,000
Now we wait.

542
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,950
Stay in the car.

543
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,220
Stay in the car.

544
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,920
Do not leave the car.

545
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,200
Do not leave this car.

546
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,710
sarah,are you okay?

547
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,340
:What are you doing here?

548
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,150
Stupid question.

549
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,110
Okay,uh,should I...?

550
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,370
Sorry.

551
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,860
Chuck,you have to get out of here.

552
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,740
No,I'm here to save you.

553
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,490
You shouldn't even be
here;you're too valuable,

554
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,290
and,besides,I have this well in hand.

555
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,960
Uh-huh,yeah,'cause
it looks well in hand.

556
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,060
Just find me somethingto pick this lock.

557
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,450
I don'T... okay,here.

558
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,130
go,go,go!

559
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,870
The tape,the tape.

560
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,350
The helicopter's ready,agent walker.

561
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,000
This is your last chance.

562
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,120
We're going toa special facility
where they're goingto torture you.

563
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,400
Really torture,not this child's play.

564
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:47,680
Or you couldjust tell
me who is patient X.

565
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,980
Somethingfor the flight.

566
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh,crap.

567
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,990
Run!

568
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,340
Oh,crap.

569
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,850
I know you.I know your secret.

570
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,990
You-you've been feedingamerican
science to north korea for years.

571
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,900
Ah,patient X.

572
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,690
To think that my secretsare
in that head of yours.

573
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,740
It's an honor,really.

574
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,190
Of course,to hell with honor.

575
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,620
I'm here for the impressivedollar
figure the human intersectwill fetch.

576
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,460
Who will I offer you to first?

577
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,800
sarah... sarah...

578
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,560
don't worry,agent walker.

579
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,470
I'll take goodcare of him.

580
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,730
No,casey,don't shoot.They have chuck.

581
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,620
Proceed to bravo coordinates.

582
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,420
The ship will bewaiting there.

583
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,050
It's about ten miles offshore.

584
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,610
15-minute flight.

585
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,810
Don't move!

586
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,280
You must be kidding.

587
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,110
I want you to landthe
helicopter right now.

588
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,950
It's heavier than you thought.

589
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,010
What?

590
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,130
The gun.

591
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,500
It's heavy.

592
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,650
Don'T... don't!

593
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,820
Give me back the gun.

594
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,870
I'm not giving you the gun!

595
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,930
you shot the pilot,you idiot!

596
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,350
I didn't mean to do that.

597
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,780
What's happening?

598
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,870
Who's flying this thing?

599
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,270
You're goingto kill us both.

600
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,930
Come on,chuck.

601
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,460
let me go.

602
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,350
get your hands off of me!

603
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,670
Get off of me!

604
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,110
oh,god.

605
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,490
That's a crane.

606
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,920
Oh,my god,casey,I thinkchuck's
flying the chopper.

607
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,370
Yeah,I'm here.

608
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,930
I told you to stay in the car.

609
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,740
You know what? Forget about the car.

610
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,230
Tell me how to fly a helicopter.

611
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,290
All right,there's a
collectivein the cyclic control.

612
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,080
What?

613
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,790
One's the stick.One looks
likean emergency brake.

614
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,060
Grab 'em both.

615
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,020
Okay,okay,I got it.

616
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,080
This is not working!

617
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,560
Push the stickjust a bit forward while
doing the same thingwith the emergency brake.

618
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,550
ground--
not good.

619
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,000
Pull up! Pull up!

620
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,710
Pull up on the emergency brake!

621
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,020
Level off.Level off!

622
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,910
I don't know how.I don't
know how to level off!

623
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,010
Listen,moron,you want to die?

624
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,950
Casey,put sarah on the phone.

625
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,510
Give me thephone,casey.

626
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,870
Here.

627
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,700
Okay... uh,chuck,you're goinge to bokay.

628
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,400
Now,I need you to focus.

629
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,750
Uh,have you ever playedany
flying games before?

630
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,680
Flight simulators? Yeah.

631
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,770
Flight simulators?
Yeah,sure,I've done those,yeah.

632
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,580
Okay,which ones?

633
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,300
Uh,maverick of the skies...
uh,stealth fighter elite...

634
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,980
uh,apache chopper patrol.

635
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,710
Great.

636
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,000
Okay,now rememberthat last one.

637
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,630
I want you to pretend likeyou're
playing that game,okay.

638
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,430
You're just in your bedroom,you're
playing a game,and none of this is real.

639
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,940
it's just a game.

640
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,410
It's just a game.

641
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,350
Okay,I can do this.

642
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,870
I can play this game.

643
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,400
Easy,chuck,easy.

644
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,820
Uh... uh,is thisone of those
helicopters that can turn into a boat?

645
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,800
No,it isn'T.

646
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,470
Just ease tothe right
and goose the brake.

647
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,750
They designed the game
exactly like the helicopter.

648
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,480
I got it.

649
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,570
I got it.

650
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,160
Almost there.

651
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,180
A little more to the right.

652
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,740
Keeping right.Keeping right.

653
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,190
Goosinakthe brE.

654
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,540
It's just a game.

655
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,600
A big scary video game.

656
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,800
oh,thank you,god!

657
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,490
oh,yes!

658
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,470
You are wonderful.

659
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,780
And that is how...I do... that!

660
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,840
That's how we do that.

661
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,340
Go,team.Sarah... see sarah.

662
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,430
Up top on that one.

663
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,610
Palms are a little sweaty,but...

664
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,170
what the hellwere you thinking?

665
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,720
Clammy hands,got it,no good.

666
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,560
Chuck,the secrets that you
knoware incredibly important.

667
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,730
You compromised everything
when you stoppedtrusting me.

668
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,200
And when you gotout of the car.

669
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,390
Listen,I'M... I'm sorry,okay?

670
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,110
No,it is not okay.

671
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,090
How could you thinkI was the double,huh?

672
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,090
You know,I am not bryce.

673
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,850
Bryce betrayed
everythingthat I believe in,

674
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,720
and if you ever accuse meof
that again,then I will walk away.

675
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,000
Mission over.We all
go back to washington.

676
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,720
And you do not want thatto happen,chuck.

677
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,160
That you should trust me on.

678
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,790
Way to go,ace.

679
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,250
Dad's suit?

680
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,020
Yeah.

681
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,950
It's my only one.

682
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,560
I'm quite certain
hewouldn't mind,though.

683
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,840
You realize that you don'thave
to go to bryce's funeral.

684
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,150
Yeah,yeah,I guess.

685
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,330
It's just we had a lot of history.

686
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,430
Even if he did get mekicked out
of school and steal my girlfriend.

687
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,910
Well... you've moved on
to bigger andbetter girls.

688
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,080
I don't really mean
biggerlike,literally bigger.

689
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,380
I just mean that,um...
that I really like sarah.

690
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,240
And I hope you guys work things out 
before the next dinner party,of course.

691
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,560
I don't know...I don't know,sis.

692
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,310
I... I... look,I reallythink I blew it.

693
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,590
Chuck,just try apologizing.

694
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,220
It goes a long way.

695
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,280
Sarah's special.

696
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,300
She's different fromyour
stanford friends.

697
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,970
He flew a helicopter?

698
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,010
Your report was
ratherterrifying,major casey.

699
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,750
Do we really havethe situation in hand,or
should Mr.Bartowskibe in our care full-time?

700
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,610
Well,you know how I feel,general.

701
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,320
But for now,we're in control.

702
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,200
Then chuck stays where he is.

703
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,360
But,uh,don't gettoo comfortable,casey.

704
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,750
The new intersect will be
upand running in six months.

705
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,300
And what happens to
chuckwhen this is done?

706
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,100
Well,you'll dowhat you do best.

707
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,690
knock,knock.

708
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,030
Hey,chuck.

709
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,370
How is everything?

710
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,950
I saw youat the funeral.

711
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,510
Oh,yeah,I had to go.

712
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,520
After everything bryce
did,he was still my partner.

713
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,320
Look,I'm not accusing
youof anything... today.

714
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,060
Yesterday,yes,I may havelaid it on
a little thick with the accusing.

715
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,880
But I'm really sorry about that.

716
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,310
Instead of not trusting you,I should
have been thanking youfor saving my life

717
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,580
and protecting the
countryand-and-and...

718
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,580
and making really tastygourmet wieners.

719
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

720
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,990
It was our first fight.

721
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,540
You know,it's a big step,if our
relationshipwere remotely real.

722
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,290
You know,with Dr.Zarnowgone,chuck,those
intersect secretsaren't going anywhere.

723
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,100
That means moremissions,more danger,more secrets
that you can't tellyour sister or your friends.

724
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,390
I know that.

725
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,450
Some people want to be heroes
and others have to be asked.

726
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,970
So... chuck,are you ready?

727
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,030
good.

728
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,300
I hope we're notinterrupting anything.

729
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:14,980
Uh... by the way,I thoughtwe'd give
that dinner another shot,maybe here.

730
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,770
We knew you'dforgive him.

731
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,170
Right,and you realize thatyou
all have to eat my cooking.

732
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,490
Give me the 411on the corn dogs.

733
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,240
What do youthink,man?

734
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,570
What do you recommend,buddy?

735
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,590
Sarah?

736
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,080
Holy... okay.

737
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,030
Cheers.
