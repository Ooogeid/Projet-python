1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,401
Here's a couple of things that you might
need to know or maybe you just forgot.

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:07,367
Hannah, there are things in my
life that you can't understand.

3
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:09,334
So I have to end this.

4
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:11,999
Chuck, I think we need to talk.
Not a good time.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,034
<i>Are you suggesting Chuck
is caught in a big,</i>

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,467
giant web of conspiracy
and deception?

7
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm gonna have to lie
to your sister,

8
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:18,899
and I can't do that
anymore.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,533
From now on, if Ellie
asks you something,

10
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:21,533
just say "I don't know."

11
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,434
You two got it bad
for this blond.

12
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,033
It's about keeping his emotions
in check so that the Intersect

13
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:29,300
<i>can work.
Flash.</i>

14
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:31,201
Come on.

15
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,668
<i>You know what, Casey?
You're right.</i>

16
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,833
I don't work. My emotions
just mess everything up.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,933
* *

18
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:43,567
<i>Hey, guys, I got your call.</i>

19
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:46,634
What's, uh...

20
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:49,333
What's going on?

21
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,234
You're the Intersect.
You tell us.

22
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,700
We've intercepted intel
that the Ring

23
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,367
is planning to turn and use
a CIA agent against us.

24
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:59,401
The problem is, we don't
know who, when or where.

25
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,566
Did you flash?

26
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,501
Uh, yeah. Not, uh, not flashing.

27
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,233
You haven't flashed
in a week, Chuck.

28
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:11,134
Ever since Rafe tried
to kill Sarah and me.

29
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:12,166
That's a problem.

30
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,233
Problem?

31
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,200
Really? Problem?
Kind of a strong word,

32
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,234
don't you think? Just 'cause
a guy had a couple off nights.

33
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:18,633
Off nights get agents killed.
You need to

34
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,768
figure this out, because the
Intersect's not working.

35
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,500
And I can't risk putting you
out in the field.

36
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,367
Okay, so, what exactly
are you saying?

37
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:27,334
I'm saying that until
you start flashing again,

38
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,301
you're no longer a spy.

39
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:30,966
No. No.

40
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,933
No, you can't...
you can't do that.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,799
Being a spy is all
that I have.

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,333
I gave up everything for this.

43
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:39,367
Well, maybe some time off
will do you good, Chuck.

44
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,799
It'll help you
function again.

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,734
I don't need- I don't
need time off, okay?

46
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,099
Maybe I'm not flashing

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,566
because I have all these
emotions bottled up in me.

48
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:46,600
You ever thought about that?

49
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:47,966
I mean, I just broke up
with Hannah,

50
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,533
I can't talk to my best friend
or my sister

51
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:50,932
about anything in my life.

52
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm not a machine.

53
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,567
Okay, I am a machine,
but I'm also a person.

54
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:57,567
Well, you can always talk to us.

55
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,067
Yeah, uh, no thanks.

56
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:06,100
I don't think that's going
to work for me.

57
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,567
Find something
that does work.

58
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:10,534
Because until you do,
you're benched.

59
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,000
* *

60
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:22,234
Mmm, this getaway was
the perfect idea, honey.

61
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,866
It's just what we needed.
You said it, babe.

62
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,134
I can't tell you how awesome
it feels to be alone,

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,533
just the two of us.

64
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,199
Mmm.

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,799
Mmm.
Mmm.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,832
Sorry.

67
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,733
It's okay.

68
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,434
I'll be just a sec.

69
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,199
Hey, Chuck.

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,033
Awesome, hey. Thank God
you picked up.

71
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,134
Everything okay, Chuck?
No, no, not really.

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,366
I broke up with Hannah,

73
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,999
and-and Sarah's falling
for another guy.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,933
Not only is my personal life
a mess,

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,433
but my spy life, too...

76
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,900
Chuck, I went on vacation to get
away from your spy life.

77
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,933
Okay? And to fix things
with Ellie.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,999
No, no. Devon, Devon, Devon.

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,199
Devon, Devon, I don't have

80
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,333
anyone else to talk to.

81
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:58,832
I'm sorry, bro.

82
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,000
But remember what you said about
discussing your spy life:

83
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,134
I don't know.

84
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,833
I say he can get
it in there,

85
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,434
but I agree with you,
it seems impossible.

86
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,333
So, put your
wagers in.

87
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,334
Put your wager- you are
going to win this, children!

88
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,832
What do you got
in your pockets?

89
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,667
MORGAN
Charles Irving Bartowski,

90
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,634
please report to the assistant
manager's office

91
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,634
for disciplinary action.

92
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,199
Right? Ah.

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,700
Oh!

94
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:27,899
Oh, my!

95
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,366
This is a shocker!

96
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:30,633
He got it in.

97
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,900
I'm saying, do not wager
against the brown beauty

98
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,266
and the snake.

99
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,867
He can unhinge his jaw
and he sheds skin.

100
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,067
Have a seat, please.

101
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:44,832
You need anything?
You okay?

102
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,366
Uh, no, I'm-I'm-I'm good.

103
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,601
I mean, you know, maybe a little
more leg room would be nice.

104
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,900
This conversation
is never

105
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,700
an easy one to have
with an employee, Chuck.

106
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,167
And what conversation
would that be, exactly?

107
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,933
We've known each other
most of our lives.

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,099
Hmm.
We, uh, we went

109
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,400
through puberty together.

110
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,768
We went through the awkward
stage after puberty,

111
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,867
the awkward high school years,
your awkward college years,

112
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:08,200
and now, our current
awkward Buy More years.

113
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:09,466
Which is why

114
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:13,100
this moment for
me is so very...

115
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,433
Awkward?

116
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,633
Yeah.

117
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,266
Morgan, what exactly is
going on?

118
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,934
Something is.
Something is going on

119
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:20,533
in your life.
You dumped Hannah.

120
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,366
She quit the Buy More.

121
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,033
She was a valued member
of the store.

122
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,066
And I just feel that

123
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,733
a true best friend
would share that

124
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,634
with his true best friend.

125
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,434
You really want
to know the truth?

126
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,832
I do.

127
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,234
Lay it on me like a slice of
cheese on a tuna melt.

128
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,267
I am ready.

129
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:42,867
Okay, here goes.

130
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,733
I...

131
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,400
Okay. Got it.

132
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,501
You don't have to say any more. Say wha
-?

133
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,966
I didn't say anything.
Mor- do you need help?

134
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,967
I'm fine. No.

135
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:11,301
I cannot believe
I'm saying this, but...

136
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:12,333
you're fired.

137
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,667
Wha- what?

138
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:15,634
You're firing me
from the Buy More?

139
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,099
Buy More? No,
are you kidding me?

140
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,133
You're the best
Nerd Herder we have.

141
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,034
I need you here.

142
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,733
I'm firing you
as my best friend.

143
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:35,645
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

144
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,132
Hey! You guys, uh-

145
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,199
you guys leaving
on the mission?

146
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,299
You sure you don't
want me to join?

147
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,333
We'd love you to, Chuck,

148
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,433
but the Intersect
is not working.

149
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:16,633
The agent that
the Ring plans

150
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:18,433
to turn is staying
at this hotel.

151
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,400
We have no record
of any spy being there,

152
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,566
so whoever it is

153
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,467
is deep undercover.

154
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,900
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

155
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:27,801
I'm still not flashing.

156
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,499
We've got to go.

157
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,701
Guys,

158
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,067
the team's a man short
without me.

159
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:35,001
Not today. I'm taking
your place on this mission.

160
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:36,366
The Ring knows that
you're still alive, Shaw.

161
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:37,800
It's too dangerous for you
to be in the field.

162
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:40,167
And I can't leave this team
shorthanded.

163
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,200
Besides, if the Ring wants a
fight, I'll give them a fight.

164
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,667
Now... when we get back
I expect this place

165
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:49,734
to be exactly
as I left it.

166
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,499
You two newlyweds ready?

167
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,767
Yeah, let's go.

168
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,867
What's with the-the... rings?

169
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,299
What...?

170
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,200
Hey, Casey. What am
I supposed to do

171
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,099
while you're gone?

172
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't you have a day job?

173
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,467
Hey, what's going on, guys?

174
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,766
Shh!

175
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,099
Charles, please!

176
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,833
It's a spy mission. You are
not qualified. Get away.

177
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,366
I...

178
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,300
49...

179
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,034
57, 43.

180
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,132
40.

181
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,833
El Segundo School
of Finance,

182
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,734
we take care of business!

183
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,068
What's going on
here, Big Mike?

184
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,199
Someone's thinking
of buying the store.

185
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,700
We're closing today
so some building

186
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:38,634
inspectors and technicians can
come down and kick the tires.

187
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,466
Sweet. We get the day off.
Jeffrey, let's get

188
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,633
pershnickered.
No.

189
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:42,800
They want to interview everyone.

190
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:45,667
Reevaluate the entire staff.

191
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,132
Gonna fire everyone
who's not essential.

192
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,033
So, I can get started over here.

193
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:52,068
We're in big trouble, boys.

194
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,866
Here are your keys.

195
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,901
Enjoy your stay here
at the Malibu Vista Hotel.

196
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:01,167
Might I add that the two of you
are a very beautiful couple.

197
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,133
Oh. Thank you.

198
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,034
You two lovebirds have fun

199
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,034
while I'm cooped up
in the van again.

200
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,000
Have a margarita for me.

201
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,801
There's a Ring agent
somewhere in this hotel.

202
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,266
We need to find him.

203
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:20,067
I tapped into the phone's
mainframe.

204
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:21,968
If the Ring calls out again,
we can trace it

205
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,499
back to the room
it originated from.

206
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,366
Sarah and I have set up
the surveillance equipment.

207
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,834
We'll begin searching
for possible targets.

208
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,499
Listen up, team.

209
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,400
These suits are sharks.

210
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,801
They'll try to divide us in our
interviews, find our weaknesses,

211
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,300
look for any excuse they
can to fire our asses.

212
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:39,733
Yeah, yeah.

213
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:42,667
Listen, despite our differences,
all we have is each other.

214
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:45,167
So let's, uh, let's stick
together here, all right?

215
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,367
This is a blood oath
right here.

216
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:50,400
One for all, and all for one.
All right.

217
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:51,433
Lester Patel?

218
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,866
Yeah, I've found it!

219
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,000
Found it! Contact lens.

220
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,033
All crisis averted.

221
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,167
I love you guys.

222
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,534
Come on down.
All right.

223
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,100
Oh, my God.
We're doomed.

224
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,634
Have a seat, yeah.

225
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,499
Okay, so...

226
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,967
before I spill this
place's dirty secrets,

227
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,399
I want to know
that I'm protected.

228
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
I want diplomatic immunity.

229
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,567
I- I don't think it's appropriate
in this situation.

230
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,399
Bah, bah, bah, bah bah, bah,
bah. You want the dirt?

231
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,733
I want immunity.

232
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,099
Okay.

233
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,266
Immunity granted.

234
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,132
Okay.

235
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,166
Thank you, my brother.

236
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,633
Well...

237
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,967
it's an interesting

238
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,633
group of employees
you put together here.

239
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:31,534
Oh, they scare me, too.

240
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,733
But I got Bartowski, don't I?

241
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:34,600
Mm-hmm.
That's right.

242
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,666
A man

243
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,466
with a Stanford degree
is working here.

244
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,467
You see, gentlemen, I'm
not just a manager;

245
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:41,333
I'm a people person.

246
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:44,300
Talent follows me.

247
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,267
Morgan Grimes, assistant
manager, how are you, sir?

248
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,600
Morgan, hey, buddy,

249
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,299
I need to talk to you.
Clearly you don't, Chuck,

250
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,666
or I wouldn't have fired you
as my best friend.

251
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,000
Can I please just have a minute?

252
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,333
Not now, Chuck, all right?

253
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,766
I'm freaking out about
this interview, man.

254
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:55,967
Look. Hey, buddy?

255
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,766
You're going to be fine.

256
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,767
Besides, it's only the Buy More.
You can always get another job.

257
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,801
It's not the end of
the world. Really?

258
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,400
See, it may not be the end
of the world to you,

259
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,166
but I don't have
a Stanford degree, Chuck.

260
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,033
I can't do anything else
but the Buy More.

261
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,766
This job is all I have.

262
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,701
I...

263
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:15,133
Chuck Bartowski? You're up.

264
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,499
<i>That's an impressive</i>

265
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,800
résumé.

266
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:26,834
So what's a Stanford grad doing
working at a Buy More?

267
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,334
Uh, you know, let's just say
the-the Buy More offers

268
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,767
more opportunities than
initially meets the eye.

269
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,099
Really?

270
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,766
For instance?

271
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,133
For instance, I get to work
with my best friend every day.

272
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,266
Your best friend?

273
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,200
Yeah.

274
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,900
Yeah, Morgan Grimes.

275
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,501
The, uh, the assistant manager.

276
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,033
Based on your
track record,

277
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,367
you're the cream
of this Buy More crop.

278
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,334
Why aren't you the
assistant manager?

279
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:57,233
Because the right guy
has already got the job.

280
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,767
I- I know that you guys
are maybe gonna be

281
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,399
making some changes around here,

282
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,667
so I just want you to
know that while I might

283
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:08,300
look good on paper, I'm
not the cream of the crop.

284
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,901
Morgan Grimes is.

285
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:17,500
Okay, the Ring just made
a call from the hotel.

286
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,467
I'll connect you in
while I trace it back.

287
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:22,666
The target is by the pool.

288
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,033
Six foot two, well built.

289
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:26,200
He's wearing a blue
and white bathing suit.

290
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:28,734
You got that, Walker?
Yeah, I got it.

291
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,867
Did you find the target?

292
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,367
Yeah, we found him.

293
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:47,566
Cheers.

294
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,467
Oh, it's so nice.

295
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,132
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.

296
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,299
Yeah, good egg.
Yeah.

297
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,499
Really good egg, yeah.

298
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,533
Really good egg.

299
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:55,566
Well, ha-have
a good day.

300
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,467
Hey, you too.
Take care.

301
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,767
Get the others in here.

302
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,266
So, you really think this

303
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,267
Bartowski guy is
Agent Carmichael?

304
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,300
Oh, it's Carmichael,
all right.

305
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,334
Looks like Shaw left him
behind to man the fort.

306
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,199
Should we abort the mission?

307
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,533
No, with Shaw not here,

308
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,266
it's our best chance to
infiltrate and recover

309
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,167
everything he has on us.

310
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,267
Have you found the entrance
into Shaw's base yet?

311
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,633
No.
We don't have much time.

312
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:21,933
We have to find it fast.

313
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,533
Do you want us
to take out Bartowski?

314
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,399
Not yet.

315
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,300
Let's keep interviewing
employees and make sure

316
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:30,367
Shaw didn't leave any
other surprises behind.

317
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,267
Chuck said Grimes
is his best friend.

318
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,634
We can use both of them
to our advantage.

319
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:40,499
What do you want me
to do about the others?

320
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,400
I think we need to
be conservative here.

321
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:54,000
Getting away is the best thing
we could've done, babe.

322
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,167
I know I haven't been
the same guy lately,

323
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,501
but since we got here,

324
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,234
I gotta tell you,
I feel awesome again.

325
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,600
Me, too.

326
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:03,967
To us.

327
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:07,567
<i>No stress, no work,
no problemas.</i>

328
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,467
The call came from Room 4305.

329
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:12,766
I'll head there now
and search it.

330
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,099
We'll go down to the pool,

331
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,200
get Devon and Ellie
out of harm's way.

332
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,267
Come on, flash!

333
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,267
Hmm.

334
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,534
Uh... no.

335
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,834
Oh, I know, I know this.

336
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,066
I know this.

337
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,868
Uh, uh, The Condor?
Uh, The Jackal?

338
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:34,666
Chan Min Chi.

339
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,934
Damn it, I thought
I had that one.

340
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:47,266
This better be good.

341
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,667
Hey, yeah, hey, just, just
checking in on the mission.

342
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:50,900
Seeing if you guys
needed anything.

343
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,032
Why, are you flashing now?

344
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,733
No, I'm not. But I thought,

345
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,834
you know, maybe if you throw me
the rock, I'll pop on something.

346
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,500
I don't have time
for this, Bartowski.

347
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,401
Only as good as your
last flash, huh?

348
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,567
Mmm, two more Piña Coladas
coming right up.

349
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:13,501
Looks good.

350
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,534
How's the water?

351
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:24,934
What are you two doing here?

352
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,666
You're not supposed
to be here.

353
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,701
I just reclaimed my
awesomeness. We got a tip that

354
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,333
the Ring was trying
to turn an agent

355
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,700
staying at this hotel.

356
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,433
You.

357
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,999
Me?

358
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,333
But I'm not an agent.

359
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,234
Chuck told me that
I was in the clear.

360
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,434
Are Ellie and I in danger?

361
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:45,434
I don't know.

362
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,734
I can't believe they're
selling the Buy More.

363
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,601
Oh, man, I think they're really
serious about buying this place.

364
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,934
'Cause they have been going
through it with a fine tooth comb.

365
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,433
Even checking lockers.

366
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:58,434
NEIL It was really
great talking to you.

367
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,401
Jeffrey Barnes?

368
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,934
You gotta help me, Morgan.

369
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,700
I got contraband in my locker.

370
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,634
What kind of contraband?

371
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,399
Just a little something I use
to take the edge off

372
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,566
on a stressful day.
If they find it,

373
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:11,566
Ill be fired for sure.

374
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,467
Mr. Barnes...

375
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:16,999
Morgan, please.

376
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,433
Okay.

377
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,334
Okay, all right, dude.

378
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm at the Ring
agent's room.

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,400
I'm going in.

380
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:30,500
Be careful.

381
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,401
I'm always careful.

382
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,601
The target is by the pool.

383
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,032
Six foot two, well built.

384
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,834
He's wearing a blue
and white bathing suit.

385
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:54,900
Our operatives are in position.

386
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,801
Ugh, it's a set-up.

387
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,399
I gotta get Ellie out of here.

388
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,999
I got to get both of us
out of here right now.

389
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,099
Keep it together, Devon.

390
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,000
We'll figure this out.

391
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,467
What? What was that?

392
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,434
I'm so sorry, false alarm.

393
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:13,066
Wait, you crashed
my weekend getaway

394
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,467
to tell me I'm in danger
and now you tell me what,

395
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,099
we're safe?
Yes, I'm sorry.

396
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,868
Please try and enjoy
the rest of your vacation.

397
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,000
We gotta get
away from this.

398
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,667
Oh, my God.

399
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,000
Let's see if we can find
anything in the break room.

400
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,466
Found something.

401
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,367
There's a tunnel
behind these lockers.

402
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,733
Fingerprint scanner.

403
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:04,900
This must be it.
Go get Del and Neil.

404
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,601
Tell them we found
the CIA base.

405
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,400
Good work.

406
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,067
Tell the others
we found Shaw's base.

407
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, my God.

408
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:34,734
This is not right, no!

409
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,399
You understand me?
Hey.

410
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,999
What's going on?

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,533
My spy work paid
off, obviously.

412
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:41,434
I mic'd Big Mike's office.

413
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:42,600
All I got was a few seconds,

414
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,233
but come in, listen.

415
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:46,767
Chuck said Grimes
is his best friend.

416
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,199
We can use both of them
to our advantage.

417
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,133
What do you want me
to do about the others?

418
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,366
I think we need to be

419
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,999
conservative here,
terminate the rest.

420
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,666
They're gonna fire
the entire store,

421
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,099
except you and Morgan.

422
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,367
I just got this job back.

423
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,900
Where is Morgan?

424
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,434
Clever, putting a CIA base
under an electronics store.

425
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,534
Every piece of
intelligence Shaw has

426
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:20,868
on the Ring is in here.
We'll be putting a dagger

427
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,600
through the heart of
the CIA's operation

428
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:24,466
by taking it out.
All right, Neil, you're on.

429
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,333
Cut off any and all
communications coming

430
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,600
in and out of the store.

431
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:28,967
Break into the mainframe,

432
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,766
find and destroy
everything they have on us.

433
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,167
Then blow this base sky high.

434
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,134
Be a pleasure.

435
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,967
The phone works remotely.

436
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,868
It was a set-up;
they've lured us here.

437
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,600
Why would they
lure us here?

438
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,967
It's not where
they lured us to,

439
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:45,000
it's where they
lured us from.

440
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,000
The Ring knows I'm alive,
which means they know

441
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,633
I'll have a base
of operations somewhere.

442
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,500
They sent us here
so I'd abandon my base.

443
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:51,967
That way they
can go and recover

444
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:53,466
all the intelligence
we have on them.

445
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:54,999
They weren't after Devon.

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,333
They're after Castle.

447
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,132
Chuck's in there,
and he's not flashing.

448
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,767
He's a sitting duck.
Go!

449
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,701
Hey, Morgan, we need to talk.
Chuck, we gotta talk, listen.

450
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,600
Me first okay, trust me,
whatever you're gonna say

451
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,666
is nothing compared
to what I got.

452
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,199
Hmm?
Okay.

453
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,667
Fine, yeah, please, shoot.
Okay, uh...

454
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:15,300
Dude, there's a secret
underground CIA base

455
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,267
under our Buy More.

456
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,333
I... Hey, listen,
I know it sounds crazy,

457
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,434
but you have to
believe me here, okay?

458
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,399
These people who are
claiming to buy the store,

459
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,867
they're bad guys, okay?

460
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:27,233
And they call
themselves the Ring.

461
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,134
Which I know is like,
ooh, not that scary...

462
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,601
But trust me, these guys
are not to be messed with.

463
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,968
How do you, how do you, how
do you know all this, Morgan?

464
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,399
Okay, I was hiding.
I was hiding in there,

465
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,533
and I saw them enter the base

466
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:37,733
through an entrance
behind our lockers.

467
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,834
So, I followed them.

468
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:42,033
I heard and saw everything.

469
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,667
Hey, whoa, whoa, dude, listen, I
know this is a lot for you to handle,

470
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,667
but you gotta stay with me,
you gotta pull together.

471
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:49,033
'Cause we are now in
real danger here, okay?

472
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,067
Buddy?

473
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,033
Don't freak out.

474
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:01,200
Chuck's not answering
his cell.

475
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,467
Buy More land line's down.
I can't get through either.

476
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,033
I think we should
call the police.

477
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,199
That's a great idea.

478
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,633
That is a great idea, man.

479
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,767
Wow, wow, yeah, yeah.

480
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,667
What...

481
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:18,001
Wha... Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

482
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,500
I don't, I don't,
I don't have a signal.

483
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:21,966
Right, right.

484
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,566
Bad guys probably cut off all
communication to the store.

485
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:24,900
It makes sense.
You know what?

486
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:26,566
By the time the cops got here
it'd be too late, anyway.

487
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,966
We need to handle this now.

488
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:28,966
No, no, no, no, Morgan.

489
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:30,366
We don't need to do anything,

490
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,633
except get everyone
out of the store.

491
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:33,534
Charles Irving Bartowski,
listen to yourself!

492
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,801
These men are trying to blow up
a CIA base under our store.

493
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,199
Okay, we are Buy More's-

494
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,500
America's last
line of defense.

495
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,900
And we are going
to take the fight to them.

496
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,499
Morgan, listen to yourself
right now.

497
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,966
This is not a video game.

498
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,266
This is real life.

499
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,466
People get hurt.

500
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,199
There is no restart
from last checkpoint.

501
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,933
I understand
that you're scared, okay?

502
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,567
And that not everybody
has the stomach to be a hero.

503
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:54,266
So I'll just go see if Jeff
and Lester want to help,

504
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,067
and, well...

505
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,266
Okay, look, fine,
fine, fine.

506
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:58,666
I will help you
on one condition.

507
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,934
We get everyone else out of
the store first, and what

508
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:05,267
you've told me remains a
secret between the two of us.

509
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,966
Yes, yes.

510
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,332
You know what?

511
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,367
No need to put
everyone else at risk.

512
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:11,766
We will handle this, okay?

513
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,667
And this secret is locked down.

514
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,600
What's going on?

515
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,167
We're locking down
the store, Charles.

516
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:22,901
We're refusing to leave until
they give us our jobs back.

517
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,199
No, gu-guys, that is a very...

518
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,433
Please, don't-
don't do that.

519
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,100
Don't put that there.
Don't, do... Stop! Stop!

520
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,599
Stop putting things down.

521
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,701
Look, locking down the store is
a very, very, very bad idea.

522
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,801
You two want to turn tail
and run, fine.

523
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,834
I'm staying here and fighting
for my job.

524
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,467
Mike, gentlemen, assorted
ladies, taking over the Buy More

525
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,767
is not only illegal, but it's
very dangerous, trust me.

526
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,500
The only thing dangerous
is if they try to fire us.

527
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,801
They're going to have to
do it over dead bodies.

528
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,366
These corporate fat cats

529
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,933
think they can take
whatever they want.

530
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:52,300
They can take
our dignity,

531
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,232
they can take all the hot women,

532
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:56,734
but they will not take our jobs!

533
00:22:56,801 --> 00:23:00,267
And they will never take
our store!

534
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,267
Buy More!

535
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,266
Sarah, Shaw, Casey,
can you hear me?

536
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,933
You have to... your frequency.

537
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:18,134
* *
Can you hear me?

538
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,134
Yeah, I can hear you.
What's going on?

539
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,100
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.

540
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,800
Listen, listen, listen.

541
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,433
The Ring is inside Castle, guys.

542
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:27,767
They came in posing as buyers
trying to purchase the store.

543
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,133
We're on our way back.
Sit tight.

544
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:32,068
This is for you. Mace.
I know it's not much,

545
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:33,800
but it'll have to do.

546
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:36,500
<i>Emmett kept a stockpile in case the
Russians attacked Red Dawn style.</i>

547
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,684
This is for you also. Walkie-talkie.
Don't drop it. It's expensive.

548
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,801
You ready to do this? Let's do
this. No, no, no, no, no, Morgan.

549
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:44,801
Listen, on second thought, I-I-I
don't think we should do this.

550
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,566
No, maybe you're right.
Let's get out of here.

551
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:47,866
Right? Maybe get a little
burger or something...

552
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,033
Are you kidding me, Chuck?!

553
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,833
Men are trying to blow up
a CIA base here, okay?

554
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,000
Time is running out.

555
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,067
Time to step up.

556
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:54,399
No, no.

557
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,567
Morgan, you don't want
to do this, okay?

558
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,399
Trust me, you don't understand.

559
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,767
You don't understand, Chuck. I've
been a loser my whole entire life

560
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:04,867
and I'm done with that, okay?
Time for me to be a hero.

561
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:16,467
But-but what is a hero, really,
you know?

562
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,300
You're all alone,
Agent Carmichael.

563
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,267
I've locked down the base.

564
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Sir, who's Agent Carmichael?

565
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,900
Okay? You're crazy.

566
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:28,801
This guy is crazy, Chuck.
Thinks you're a spy.

567
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,566
Yeah, yeah, th-that's
ridiculous, thinking I'm a spy.

568
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:31,900
Ridiculous, sir.

569
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:34,068
Okay, listen to me, we
work at the Buy More, all right?

570
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:36,168
And if you just- if you
let us go, I promise

571
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,833
we're not going to tell anyone
what you're doing here.

572
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:38,900
Tell him, Chuck.

573
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,734
Yeah, yeah, yeah, n-not a word.

574
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:44,901
Zipping it. Locking it down.
Locked, it's already locked down.

575
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,633
That is a really
sharp looking razor.

576
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:48,734
We've searched the
base's main frame.

577
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:51,168
Shaw's files aren't there.

578
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:54,701
We know that he's
hiding them here.

579
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,267
Tell us where they are,
Agent Carmichael.

580
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,367
Trust me-
the alternative

581
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:02,167
is extremely unpleasant.

582
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,367
You know, I don't think there's
any need for torture right now,

583
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:06,199
because even if I was a spy,
which I'm not-

584
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,834
I'm not saying that I am a spy-
but even if I was a spy,

585
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:11,867
my training would have taught me
to withstand said torture.

586
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,834
So I don't really think it's
going to have any kind

587
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,633
of effect at this particular
juncture, right?

588
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:17,701
That's why I'm going
to torture him.

589
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,666
You made the mistake
of telling us

590
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,767
the bearded fella's
your best friend.

591
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:27,500
For the last time-

592
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,933
where are the files,
Agent Carmichael?

593
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:33,034
Guys, guys, please, please,
please just listen to me.

594
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,499
This is ridiculous, okay?

595
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,400
I have known this man my
entire life, all right?

596
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:41,233
Chuck Bartowski has been
my best friend- my brother-

597
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,200
since we were six.

598
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,367
Chuck Bartowski is not a spy.

599
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:46,800
Chuck?

600
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,734
Chuck! Chuck!
Chuck, please!

601
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,666
Tell him something! Tell
him the truth! Chuck!

602
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,900
I'm really scared here!
Chuck!

603
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,266
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, stop, stop! Chuck!

604
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:55,434
Stop, stop.

605
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:00,600
Morgan, the-the truth is...

606
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:07,967
The truth is... I am a member

607
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:13,267
of a joint NSA-CIA
black ops team

608
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:16,567
that is stationed
here in Burbank.

609
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:19,600
I have a level six clearance,

610
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:23,300
and my code name
is Charles Carmichael.

611
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,701
I'm a spy, buddy.

612
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,867
Sarah, anything?

613
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:41,834
We're locked out. They overwrote
our security access.

614
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,466
I'm locked out here.

615
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,367
Casey's checking
the Buy More.

616
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:54,133
Cease fire, cease fire.

617
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:55,933
Hold your- hold your fire.

618
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,834
Unlock the door.

619
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,467
What the hell is going on
in here?

620
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:03,900
The store's being bought.

621
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:06,534
They're canning everybody
except Bartowski and Grimes.

622
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,599
We're staging a revolution

623
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,399
to take down the Man.

624
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,533
I want in.

625
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:12,701
How do we know that we can
trust you, son?

626
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,466
That you're not some kind of spy
for the Man?

627
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,232
Because the only thing
I hate more

628
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,800
than hippie neo-liberal fascists

629
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:19,199
and anarchists...

630
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,433
are the hypocrite
fat-cat suits

631
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,801
they eventually grow up
to become.

632
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,767
Yep, that works for me.
Good-good-good point.

633
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:25,766
Nice to chat.

634
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,667
Welcome aboard, my brother.

635
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:30,467
You're a spy?

636
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:32,133
You remember what
I just said

637
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:34,034
about freaking out? I think
you're doing that right now,

638
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,232
and-and-and you shouldn't
do that.

639
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:37,867
You're a spy?
Stay with me, buddy, okay?

640
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:39,466
You two can kiss
and make up later.

641
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:41,400
Where are Shaw's files?

642
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:42,466
Now, Chuck!

643
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,800
We've got visitors.

644
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:45,000
Colonel Casey and Agent Walker

645
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,599
decided to join
the party.

646
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,534
Casey and Sarah
are spies, too?

647
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,034
You have a lot of
catching up to do.

648
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:52,466
Excuse me while I take care
of your friends.

649
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,734
We'll save the torture
for later.

650
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,168
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

651
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:00,833
I can't- I can't believe it.

652
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,034
All this time,

653
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:04,800
you kept this
a secret?

654
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,533
From me?

655
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,366
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

656
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,101
You have no idea how badly
I've wanted to tell you.

657
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:14,101
All this lying about
where I've been.

658
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,500
You know, making plans
and breaking them.

659
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,300
And-And all the time,
all I've wanted to do

660
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,933
is tell you all about it, but...

661
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:22,867
but I had to protect
you, too, you know?

662
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,834
Please understand that.

663
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,767
Wow...

664
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:29,901
Wow!

665
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,867
I don't...

666
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,367
My best friend is a spy?!

667
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:36,800
This is unbelievable!

668
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,232
This is the best news
I've ever heard!

669
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,734
Holy smokes, it makes
perfect sense, too.

670
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:42,767
Why we stopped
hanging out and talking.

671
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,834
I thought I lost you, buddy.
I thought I lost you.

672
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,466
But you were out
saving the world?

673
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:49,534
Chuck, you are officially
rehired as my best friend.

674
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,466
Great. That's
good news. Thanks.

675
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,833
Oh, I have so many questions.

676
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,133
I mean, wh-wh-where do I start?

677
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:56,034
Uh, how did this happen?

678
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,567
Did they recruit you
at the Buy More? Stanford?

679
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:02,233
Chuck? Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we're going to die here, Chuck,

680
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,167
so no time for secrets.

681
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:07,534
You know what,
you're right, buddy.

682
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,266
You're right. And-And...

683
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,167
and quite frankly,
you deserve to know.

684
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,700
So here goes- you ready?

685
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:15,834
Yeah. Yeah, man.

686
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:17,266
Okay.

687
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:19,333
This all started about
two and a half years ago

688
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,300
when I got an e-mail
from Bryce Larkin...

689
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,667
* Some folks are born
made to wave the flag *

690
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:40,001
* Ooh, the red,
white and blue *

691
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:43,634
* And when the band plays
"Hail to the Chief" *

692
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:47,168
* Ooh, they point
their cannon at you, Lord *

693
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:51,034
* It ain't me, it ain't me *

694
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:54,667
* I ain't no senator's son,
son *

695
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:58,467
* It ain't me, it ain't me *

696
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:00,801
* I ain't no fortunate one, no *

697
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:04,001
What the hell is that noise?

698
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,834
The Buy More employees
have staged a revolution.

699
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:09,867
So that's the sound
of liberty? Mm-hmm.

700
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,400
* But when the taxman
comes to the door *

701
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,200
* Lord, the house looks
like a rummage sale... *

702
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,666
<i>Good news, bad news.</i>

703
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,867
The good news- we found what
we were looking for.

704
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:21,634
I've uploaded it
to headquarters.

705
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:24,001
The bad news, Colonel Casey's
arrived at the Buy More.

706
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:26,034
Could be a problem.

707
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,001
Not if he's dead. Kill him.

708
00:30:29,134 --> 00:30:31,233
* Whoo *

709
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,534
* It ain't me, it ain't me *

710
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,500
* I ain't no fortunate one,
no, no, no *

711
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:41,168
* It ain't me, it ain't me *

712
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:45,634
* I ain't no fortunate son. *

713
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,332
Peace out, man.

714
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,900
Hey, brother Casey,

715
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:13,801
make love not war.

716
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:16,901
You want a hit?

717
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,101
Hey, man,
that's not cool.

718
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,333
Fight the power.

719
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:38,934
Yeah. Peace out.

720
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,001
Crap!

721
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,968
Castle has a self-destruct
program built into it

722
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,700
in case of catastrophic
events like this.

723
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,100
I'm calling Langley
to activate it now.

724
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:55,400
You can't destroy the Castle.
Chuck is down there.

725
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,467
So is every piece
of intelligence we have.

726
00:31:57,534 --> 00:31:59,266
Not just on the Ring-
everything.

727
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:01,200
Please, just give Chuck
five more minutes, okay?

728
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,566
For me.

729
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,433
I'm sorry, Sarah, but you
can't think of Chuck.

730
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:05,966
You have to think
like a spy.

731
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,300
I am thinking like a spy.
Chuck is a member of my team,

732
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,067
and he has served
this country well,

733
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:12,434
and for all that he has done,

734
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,934
the least we can do is just give
him five more minutes.

735
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,367
So, that's it.

736
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:26,168
That's how it happened.

737
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,634
So, now I got this thing
in my brain-

738
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:30,901
the Intersect,
like I told you-

739
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:34,001
you know, and...
and it's not working.

740
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:36,634
Anything else you want
to know before we die?

741
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:38,599
Uh, yeah, yeah.

742
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,866
Just one more.

743
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,633
Um, so if Sarah

744
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:44,068
is your handler,
does that make her your beard?

745
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,366
In other words, like,

746
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:47,232
is your whole
relationship a fake?

747
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:51,001
'Cause, oh, buddy, that's...
that's just awful.

748
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:52,700
Why? Because we never had sex?

749
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:54,533
No, I just feel like,
you know, having to be...

750
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:56,834
you never had sex
with that girl?

751
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,533
That's not... no, no.

752
00:32:58,534 --> 00:32:59,933
It's... it's awful that you had

753
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,466
to pretend to be
in a relationship

754
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:03,801
with somebody
that you clearly love.

755
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,267
Sarah and I are over, you know.

756
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,400
No, you're not.

757
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,400
You're a good liar, Chuck,
but you're not that good.

758
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,367
All right, you lied to me
for three years,

759
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:16,766
but I always knew

760
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:17,866
you loved
that girl.

761
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,199
I mean,

762
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,467
I saw the way you looked at her.

763
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:23,434
We all did.

764
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,834
It's okay.

765
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,367
You don't have
to deny it.

766
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:32,068
Tell me you don't
love Sarah.

767
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:42,168
You know what,
you're right, buddy.

768
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:44,133
I do love Sarah.

769
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:47,333
I kept telling myself
that I didn't.

770
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:52,834
That I wouldn't,
I couldn't, but I do.

771
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,467
Morgan, you have no idea
how badly I needed

772
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:01,667
to get all this off my chest.

773
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:03,634
Thank you.

774
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,633
Get rid of them.

775
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,534
Kill them.
Dump the bodies.

776
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,332
Thank me later, buddy.

777
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,534
We're about
to die.

778
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,667
No, you're not.

779
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,200
Hey!

780
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,133
Chuck, sword!

781
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:48,034
Thanks, buddy.

782
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,734
Mine's bigger than yours.

783
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,332
That was incredible.

784
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,700
You were incredible.
You were like

785
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:18,168
Bruce Lee, Van Damme, Seagal
all rolled up into one.

786
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,233
That's my best friend!

787
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:24,300
Yeah, he's out. He's out.

788
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,733
I couldn't get in.

789
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,867
We're locked out.

790
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,834
Time's up.

791
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,967
MAN
This is Langley Control.

792
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,467
Bag 'em and tag 'em, Sarah.

793
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:04,100
Excuse me.

794
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:06,001
Agent Walker.

795
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,834
We'll just have to put Grimes
in witness protection.

796
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:28,101
Move him out of Burbank tonight
after dark.

797
00:36:28,168 --> 00:36:29,433
What? Wait, wait, wait.

798
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,100
No, no, no.
Hang... hang on a second.

799
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,001
Morgan is not
going anywhere, okay?

800
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,232
Chuck, he knows your secret.

801
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,067
Yeah, well,
so do a lot of people.

802
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,966
Awesome knows, and we didn't
put him underground.

803
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:39,433
Yeah, because
Awesome's awesome.

804
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:41,100
Grimes is a moron.

805
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:42,399
It's just too dangerous.

806
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,933
We have no reason to believe

807
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:46,101
that we can trust
him. Yes, we do.

808
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:48,367
We have 22 reasons
why we can trust him.

809
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:49,499
That's the number of years

810
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,966
that Morgan
has been my best friend.

811
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,867
And, yes, he has his faults-
granted-

812
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:55,634
but one thing he is is loyal,

813
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:59,134
and he will never betray me
or my secret.

814
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,300
He's right.

815
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:06,499
Thank you.

816
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,866
Look, I'm flashing.

817
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:10,467
I'm a spy again because
I have my best friend back.

818
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:12,299
You need the Intersect,

819
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,267
and I need him,
so Morgan Grimes is staying

820
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,701
exactly where he belongs,
which is the Burbank Buy More.

821
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:32,466
Hey. Hey, buddy.

822
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,100
Hey.
Sorry about the wait.

823
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,499
No, no problem, no prob...

824
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,766
Casey.

825
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,466
Always walking around
so angry.

826
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,634
I should've known
you had a big secret.

827
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:42,167
God help us.

828
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:43,866
So, yeah, everything's okay.

829
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:45,533
That's great.
Yes! I love to hear it.

830
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:47,399
Okay, so am I, uh, like,

831
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,199
officially part
of the team or...

832
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,566
Let's um...

833
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,467
let-let's walk
before we run, huh, buddy?

834
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,167
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yeah.

835
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,666
Definitely. And maybe
crawl before that.

836
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,033
Yeah, yeah. You know what,
we should celebrate.

837
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,633
Okay, little old-school
game night-

838
00:37:58,634 --> 00:37:59,966
<i>Duck Hunt, Subway
meatball marinaras</i>

839
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:01,133
with extra jalapeños.

840
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:02,167
That's how
you like it.

841
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:03,599
And, uh, just
the two of us.

842
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,500
Yeah, just the two of us.

843
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:18,000
Buy More.

844
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,199
Yes, hello.

845
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,966
This is Craig Rogers
from Buy More corporate.

846
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,168
I heard what happened
down there today.

847
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:25,567
Interesting display
you put on there.

848
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:27,534
You-You calling to fire us

849
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,067
or arrest us?

850
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,733
Neither.

851
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:32,366
I'm calling to hire you.
Huh?

852
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,567
Yesterday, I was planning
on selling this store.

853
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:36,433
But I spoke
to the potential buyers,

854
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:37,866
and from what I've heard,

855
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,001
your store showed
the most incredible display

856
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,068
of store loyalty I've ever seen.

857
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:44,333
The store is no longer for sale.

858
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:56,200
* *

859
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,333
Victory!

860
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,967
No, I'm not
kidding you.

861
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:08,733
<i>When was the last time you
beat me at Duck Hunt?</i>

862
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,299
I am the old-school
master. I...

863
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,767
What are you...? I want you to tell me
- when was the last time

864
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,566
<i>that you beat me at Duck Hunt?
That's... that's incredible.</i>

865
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,100
Uh, hey, keep
these, uh,

866
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:17,533
meatball subs warm for me,
would you, buddy?

867
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:19,967
I'll be right in.

868
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,834
Um, I talked to Shaw,
and I heard what happened.

869
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:27,634
The Ring used me as a decoy.
You said I was safe, bro.

870
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:28,700
And you are.

871
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,100
You... you will be, okay?

872
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,233
We are doing everything
that we can to make sure

873
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,834
that you and Ellie are
protected and safe.

874
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,400
Okay?

875
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:41,766
Okay.

876
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:44,333
* *

877
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:58,067
Are you okay?
You've been

878
00:39:58,068 --> 00:39:59,599
a nervous wreck
ever since this morning.

879
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,266
Babe, we need
to get away.

880
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:02,766
We just got away.

881
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,001
I'm talking about
really getting away.

882
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:06,167
You know, just
you and me.

883
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:08,500
Okay. Where do you want to go?

884
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,067
Cabo?

885
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:11,399
Further.

886
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,466
Hawaii?

887
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:13,666
No, no. Further.

888
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:16,034
I'm talking about...

889
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,767
Africa.

890
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,734
Africa?

891
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:23,766
We can join Doctors
Without Borders.

892
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,466
Doctors Without Borders?

893
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,133
Honey, you didn't want
to go to France.

894
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,700
This is different, hon.

895
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:30,332
I am talking
about you and me

896
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,400
traveling the world.
What do you say?

897
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:34,934
I don't know what to say.

898
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,633
Say yes.

899
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:40,333
This is crazy. We can't
just up and leave.

900
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,000
What about Chuck?
I'm the only family

901
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:43,266
that he has.

902
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,366
But this isn't about Chuck.

903
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:45,966
No, this is about you and me.

904
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,101
Our family.

905
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:50,068
Come on, babe.

906
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:53,867
So, now that the Ring
knows about the Castle,

907
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,967
does that mean we have to
shut down the operation?

908
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:57,566
The Ring shut down
all communications.

909
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:59,634
They never had a chance
to let their superiors know

910
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:01,266
about their discovery.

911
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,499
That'll buy us
the time we need

912
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,933
to put together
a full offensive,

913
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,599
take them down
once and for all.

914
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,801
So then, what's wrong?

915
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:10,134
The Ring had me dead to
rights today in Malibu.

916
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,100
So why didn't they kill me?

917
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:16,667
So, Sarah and Casey-
they're really spies, huh?

918
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:19,400
Yeah, yeah.
They're great.

919
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:21,934
I trust them
with my life.

920
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,666
Are you kidding me?

921
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,533
That is ridiculous, dude.

922
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:32,733
Look at that shooting.

923
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:34,466
Are...

924
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:36,667
You did your flash thingy on it.

925
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:38,634
<i>You flashed on Duck Hunt.</i>

926
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,499
Hello?

927
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,100
MAN
Hello, Colonel Casey.

928
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,001
It's been a while.
