1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:00,951
<i>I'm Chuck.</i>

2
00:00:01,076 --> 00:00:03,836
<i>Here are some things that you might need
to know, or maybe you just forgot.</i>

3
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:06,839
- I'm not who you think I am.
- You're Orion.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,759
- My father invented the Intersect.
- No hug for your old partner?

5
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:11,969
I'm been looking for you
for a long time.

6
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:14,263
Put him on the helicopter,
and kill his son.

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,516
I overheard them say that they're
moving your father to Black Rock.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,853
Black Rock is a code name
for a secret Fulcrum base in Barstow.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,856
<i>I'm shutting down this project.
Chuck's going into lockdown.</i>

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,733
Operation "Moron" is over.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,250
They're gonna take you underground.

12
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,679
We have to run.
Your dad is still out there.

13
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:33,199
You're committing treason.
You could go to jail.

14
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,785
I know.

15
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:50,834
According to the coordinates,
this should be Black Rock.

16
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:56,080
It doesn't exactly look like
a Fulcrum compound now, does it?

17
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:57,807
Maybe your flash was wrong.

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,934
No, they had to have just moved
my father.

19
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,611
These beer are fresh.
There's still ash on the cigarette.

20
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:05,636
- Could have been kids having a party.
- Great.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,945
We've got to start all over again.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,394
Chuck, we're AWOL.
It's why we ditched the car.

23
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,554
If Casey finds us, I go to jail,

24
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,729
you go to a padded cell
with 24-hour surveillance.

25
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,259
There is no going back.

26
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:27,908
Don't give up, Charles.

27
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:31,978
Cute couple.

28
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,997
- If anything happens to them...
- What are you going to do?

29
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,144
You going to kill me?
You going to beat me to a pulp?

30
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,477
I'm sure you can come up
with something more creative.

31
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,645
No, you...

32
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,963
you had it right. I'll kill you!

33
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,956
Forgot about that.
I'm sorry. I'll tell you what.

34
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:54,321
As long as the new Intersect
is operational by tomorrow night,

35
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,574
- your son will be fine.
- Hold on.

36
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,367
There's still a ton of diagnostics
to run, simulations...

37
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:01,746
I can't guarantee
I can finish it by then.

38
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,540
Well then, I can't guarantee
your son's safety.

39
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:09,477
<i>The safety of the Intersect
is no longer my main concern.</i>

40
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,256
<i>I want you to hunt Agent Walker
and the Asset down.</i>

41
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,474
<i>- Bring them back. Dead or alive.</i>
- Understood, General.

42
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,208
<i>Once the Intersect is in our possession,
this mission will be over</i>

43
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,493
<i>and you will have your pick
of assignments.</i>

44
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,016
<i>Your country thanks you...</i>

45
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:23,966
<i>Colonel Casey.</i>

46
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:26,080
<i>Congratulations.</i>

47
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,544
<i>You've earned it.</i>

48
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:28,814
Got it.

49
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,792
What are you doing here, bro?

50
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:46,066
Chuck hasn't been showing up.

51
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:48,090
I was looking for some clues
where he might be.

52
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,819
- Chuck, I just heard from him.
- Really? He just called?

53
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,899
He left a voice mail not 5 minutes ago.
Our wedding is this weekend

54
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,224
and he decided to go out of town.

55
00:02:57,865 --> 00:02:59,804
Good. Glad to hear...
hear he's safe.

56
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,806
Sorry, nervous Nellie, I guess.

57
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,274
Have a nice day!

58
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,097
Babe,

59
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:07,188
we've got to get
a lock for that window.

60
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,981
I need emergency satellite
tracking on an unregistered line

61
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:19,240
that dialed the following number
5 minutes ago.

62
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,479
As you can see...

63
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:33,337
just the one bed.

64
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,132
A little presumptuous, I guess.
Should I have asked for separate rooms?

65
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,681
No. It's fine.

66
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:41,662
As long as we're on the lam,
I can't let you out of my sight.

67
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,656
I'm going to take a shower.

68
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:48,686
I'm going to assume that that whole out
of sight thing doesn't really apply now.

69
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:53,744
Right.

70
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:00,488
I'm at the motel
a mile south of the base.

71
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:03,492
They just checked in.
You want me to kill them?

72
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,289
Vincent,
I may need them for leverage.

73
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,956
<i>When the tests are complete,</i>

74
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,492
<i>feel free to use
whatever despicable acts of violence</i>

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,550
are in your nature.

76
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,008
You could eat them if you want.

77
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:28,905
I'll sleep on the floor.

78
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,466
No, it's okay.

79
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,198
Why are you doing this?

80
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:45,319
Because the floor is gross,

81
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:48,094
and I'm not going
to make you sleep on it.

82
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,610
No, why are you here,

83
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:53,514
risking everything
that you worked so hard for?

84
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,639
Because,

85
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,880
after everything
that you've done for this country,

86
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,198
you deserve to find your father,

87
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,077
to get the Intersect
out of your head

88
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,220
and to have a chance
at a normal life.

89
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,550
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

90
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,059
It's my job to protect you.

91
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,477
What about when it's not your job?

92
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:15,715
What happens to us then?

93
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:19,657
One mission at a time, Chuck.

94
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,126
<i>Telecom tracking complete.
Location verified.</i>

95
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:37,419
Gotcha.

96
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,759
The Yvonne's Team presents:

97
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,849
Season 2 - Episode 21
<i>Chuck Versus the Colonel</i>

98
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:19,253
Sub-way.fr (v1.00)

99
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:22,381
Friends?

100
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,601
I wish people in our line of work
could afford friends.

101
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:29,096
That's just one of the sacrifices
of upper management.

102
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:32,558
Big Mike is my friend,

103
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,066
and I never would have betrayed him

104
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:37,591
- if you hadn't tricked me.
- Really?

105
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:42,501
Do all your friends give your mother
urinary tract infections?

106
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,915
Listen, Grimes.
I am offering you a <i>cup</i>...

107
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:50,184
up the corporate ladder.

108
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,328
- Dude...
- Now...

109
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,596
I need a new assistant manager.

110
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,772
Will you be my Ass Man?

111
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,117
Are you kidding me?

112
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:03,765
No. Never.

113
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,046
And as far as friends go,
I have Chuck, that's all I need.

114
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,820
Don't move.

115
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:35,194
Don't breathe.

116
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,468
Just stay there.
Stay. Stay.

117
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,369
I'm going to kill you, Morgan.

118
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:01,159
Dead man walking.

119
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,919
What do you want?

120
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,744
I want to speak to Michael.

121
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,173
I want to clear the air.

122
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:20,332
Come closer.

123
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:28,192
Mike, I know that this...
this whole thing is my fault.

124
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:32,044
I never knew Emmett
was trying to take over the store.

125
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,155
Truth is,

126
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:35,718
I just wanted you
to stop dating my mother.

127
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,119
You should be so lucky that a man
of his stature would defile your mother.

128
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,123
- Sorry.
- Never take sides

129
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,167
- against the family again.
- Understood.

130
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,080
What can I do to make it right?
I'll do anything...

131
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:49,678
stepfather.

132
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,117
<i>Michael, there's a mess that needs
cleaning in bathroom stall 3.</i>

133
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,592
No, let me do it.

134
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:56,704
I'll handle this.

135
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:01,243
We all have to clean up
our own messes in this world, son.

136
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,665
This can stop anytime you want.

137
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:11,545
All you have to do
is accept my offer.

138
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,844
Don't move.
I'm going to be right back.

139
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:32,661
I have very sensitive sinuses.

140
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,504
9 millimeters of hot lead
should clear that right out.

141
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:38,071
You really think you could
run away from me? Let's go.

142
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:39,196
What?

143
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,194
Sarah had nothing to do with this.
What's going to happen to her?

144
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:44,357
Sir,

145
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,019
we have an issue.

146
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,359
I told her not to move.

147
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:19,094
- Chuck, let's go.
- Sorry, Casey.

148
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:22,848
God.

149
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:40,115
Fulcrum is here.
We can't leave Casey.

150
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,368
- They're going to torture him.
- If we go back he's going to arrest us.

151
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,662
Yes, I know.
But we can't leave him.

152
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:48,230
Okay, fine.

153
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,705
One condition: you stay in the car.

154
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:52,432
Deal.

155
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,652
Going somewhere?

156
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,654
We came back here for you
because Fulcrum's here.

157
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,366
- Then we better get out of here.
- I'm not leaving without Sarah.

158
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,186
- You drive or I end you.
- End me? How're you going to do that?

159
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,271
You have no gun.

160
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,754
You don't think I could kill you
with my thumb or my elbow?

161
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,820
- Nerd bludgeoned by radiator?
- You can't kill me with that radiator.

162
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:34,545
It is far too confined here
for you to get the appropriate torque.

163
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,713
I could strangle you
with the handcuff chain.

164
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,340
You could maybe do that.

165
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:40,717
Too late.

166
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,344
They got her. Let's go.

167
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,180
I told you.

168
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,093
I'm not leaving without Sarah.

169
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,571
Stay down!

170
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,432
Drop it!

171
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,851
Can't do that, John.

172
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,019
Guys!

173
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,105
Let's just take a beat here.
Remember, we are a team.

174
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,398
Stay in the car!

175
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,817
Technically,
I still have one foot in the car.

176
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:43,764
How far you think
you're going to get?

177
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,323
Until we rescue Chuck's dad.

178
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,513
You're out of bullets.

179
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,076
It's over.

180
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:56,585
On the ground.

181
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,501
You two mind taking that outside?

182
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:12,058
We're in a bomb shelter.

183
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,871
I'm sorry, Sarah.

184
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,073
You didn't do anything wrong, Chuck.

185
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:30,160
You trusted somebody
who you thought cared about you.

186
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,210
Look outside, Chuck.

187
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,712
Look out the window.

188
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:47,986
"Tron."

189
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:50,284
"Tron"! Did you see that?
My father signaled me!

190
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:51,488
Did you just flash?

191
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,351
Come on. A midnight screening of <i>Tron</i>?
My father had to have written that.

192
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,354
Come on. We got to go back there!
My father's there!

193
00:14:58,144 --> 00:14:59,344
Casey, please!

194
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,802
I don't care.

195
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,871
Something weird is going on.

196
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,581
Have you seen Chuck? He didn't
come home last night, Casey came by,

197
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,167
said he was worried about him.

198
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,707
I'm sure. Can't live without
his precious Chuck.

199
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,914
- What's that supposed to mean?
- The guy's obsessed with him,

200
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,218
a classic perv.

201
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:30,345
- No offense.
- Obsessed how?

202
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:34,099
You want to see
something really freaky?

203
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,107
Dude keeps a Chuck diary.

204
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,611
Bathroom visits...
and duration.

205
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,775
Keys,

206
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,268
duct tape,

207
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,533
high-grade chloroform...

208
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,203
From one stalker to another,
I'm impressed.

209
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:58,665
You guys think this has something to do
with Chuck missing?

210
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:00,731
I don't care. No clue.

211
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:02,911
You mind if I...

212
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,588
get right?

213
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,838
Casey, please!

214
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,891
<i>Excellent work.</i>

215
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,022
- Thank you, General.
<i>- A CIA team is on their way</i>

216
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:21,229
<i>to take Agent Walker
and the Asset back to Langley.</i>

217
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,024
- What about my father?
- Chuck received a signal from him.

218
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,234
He believes there may be
a mission tonight.

219
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,612
<i>We'll look into it, Ms. Walker.</i>

220
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:30,328
<i>In the meantime,</i>

221
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:32,842
<i>enjoy your last few moments
in Burbank,</i>

222
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:34,163
<i>Colonel Casey.</i>

223
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:42,786
Now I get it.

224
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,503
Now I understand
why you would betray your own team.

225
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,669
I would never betray my team!

226
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,382
You went AWOL.

227
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:50,962
You betrayed me.

228
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,667
Don't you ever forget that.

229
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,057
So sorry, Colonel.

230
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,769
But congratulations on that
chicken franchise you always wanted.

231
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,729
- Keep talking...
- Stay on Beckman.

232
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,528
It might be too late by midnight.

233
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:07,378
Just make sure
we don't give up on Chuck's father.

234
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:09,103
If your dad's there...

235
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,905
we'll keep him safe.
You have my word.

236
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,266
It's your neighbor, Devon Woodcomb.
Door was unlocked.

237
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,603
This is creepy.

238
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,148
Is that Chuck's bedroom?

239
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:50,276
Freakburger...

240
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:04,714
I hate this whole family.

241
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,355
<i>Boss Man calling Ass Man.</i>

242
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,924
<i>Radio check.
The new automated have arrived,</i>

243
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,135
<i>if you could please
have Mike unload them.</i>

244
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,384
Hold on a second.
You said that if I agreed...

245
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,394
<i>Into the headset.</i>

246
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:23,184
You said that if I agreed
to be your Ass Man,

247
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,768
<i>you wouldn't make Mike do
any more humiliating jobs.</i>

248
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:28,356
<i>- And you wouldn't fire him.
- Get it done.</i>

249
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:38,574
Good luck using automated checkout
machines with no power.

250
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,410
- Where'd you get that?
- Casey's locker.

251
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,746
Morgan's really turned
into Emmett's stooge.

252
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,042
This will show them
who's really in charge.

253
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:50,817
We did it.

254
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,506
That way! Go!

255
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,229
For whatever it's worth...

256
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,170
if I have to spend the rest of my days
in a dark, windowless room,

257
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:11,158
I can't think of a better person
to spend it with.

258
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,433
That's not really how this works.

259
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,862
We can't request a cozy little two-bed,
two-bath cell?

260
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:19,579
Two-bed?

261
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:37,381
<i>Electrical interruption.
Auxiliary power activated.</i>

262
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:39,427
Quick,
before the power turns back on.

263
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,640
Is that Awesome?

264
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,512
Ass Man!

265
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,890
We are under siege!

266
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,854
Shoot to kill!

267
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,694
Well... Hey, there, Emmett.

268
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:02,938
It is a good thing I installed
those emergency generators.

269
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:04,661
I underestimate you.

270
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,287
That was awesome!

271
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,706
- Fire them.
- Move! Move!

272
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,000
<i>I saw you on the security cam!</i>

273
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,419
Stay calm.

274
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:20,927
How're you doing?

275
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:28,777
What are you doing here?

276
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,063
We need to talk.

277
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:35,775
I get it, dude. You know,
there was a time in my life

278
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,976
that I didn't have
a lot going on either.

279
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:39,612
Dead-end job, no girl...

280
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,777
- Really?
- Well, no, John.

281
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:45,595
But this is not the answer. Okay?

282
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:49,158
You need help, bro.
You need serious psychiatric help.

283
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,689
What are you doing, man?!
Put the gun away, dude!

284
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:58,107
Take another step
and I will drop you.

285
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:16,065
Not bad for a frat boy.

286
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,486
- Don't you move.
- What the...?!

287
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,313
What the hell is going on here?

288
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:29,579
Don't freak out.

289
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:36,510
This is crazy.
We've got to call the police.

290
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,422
We can't do that.
Here, drink this.

291
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,959
He tried to kill me!

292
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:43,176
- Why can't we call the cops?
- Because I am the cops.

293
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,305
Moron.

294
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:52,868
I am a high-level CIA asset
and these are my handlers.

295
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:55,855
For the past 2 years,
they've had to protect my every move.

296
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:57,859
He can handle it.

297
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,646
You can handle this, right?
Tell me you can handle this.

298
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,216
You're being serious?

299
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,365
- He's being serious?
- I need you to help me.

300
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:08,076
I need you to be cool about this.

301
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,839
I need you to cover
for me with Ellie.

302
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,114
I need you...

303
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:13,888
to be Awesome.

304
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:16,794
Can you be Awesome?

305
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:22,215
You're a spy, Chuck?

306
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,041
Yeah, more or less, yeah.

307
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:34,127
This is...

308
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:37,522
Awesome!

309
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:41,818
I knew you weren't a loser
who worked at the Buy More.

310
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,112
"Loser's" a little...
that's a little harsh.

311
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,115
Here's the thing...
the Buy More actually is real.

312
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:50,410
But here's the most important thing.
I need you to do this for me right now.

313
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,870
I need you to go home
and handle Ellie.

314
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:54,812
That is your mission.

315
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:55,999
Can you do that?

316
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,535
I got your back, bro.

317
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,570
Right, right.

318
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,508
- A spy!
- Keep that on the D.L.

319
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,662
Impersonating a military official's
a federal offense, numbnuts.

320
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,986
- Put it on the list.
- Don't you leave me here

321
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:12,308
We got to go.

322
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,525
You walk out that door,
you're a dead man.

323
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,800
I don't care.

324
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,327
You will care.

325
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:22,400
I smell bacon.

326
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,569
Anyone else smell pig?

327
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,863
I seem to detect the faint odor
of the forbidden meat.

328
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,359
Knock it off. Listen to me.

329
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:31,117
You need to apologize to Emmett
for blowing the power, otherwise

330
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,327
- he's going to can you.
- Nice try.

331
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,788
Get us to apologize
so we look like asses.

332
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,367
Lose all our street cred.

333
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:39,255
You're going to have
to accept 1 concept.

334
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,545
What's that?

335
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,463
No one on this planet
is as dumb as you are.

336
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,257
I'm trying to help you guys.
- Are you?

337
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,510
Why are you taking all this crap
from everyone?

338
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,041
What choice do I have?

339
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,049
Emmett is trying to fire
the entire store,

340
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:54,711
I am the glue that holds it.

341
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,934
Why do you care
if this store holds together?

342
00:23:57,624 --> 00:23:59,037
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

343
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:01,647
don't you have some goal
in this world outside the store?

344
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,233
Even Jeff and Lester
have their ridiculous band.

345
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:05,985
Don't you have a dream?

346
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,863
Of course, I do. It's just...

347
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:09,864
What?

348
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:12,658
It's crazy and you'll laugh at me.

349
00:24:13,923 --> 00:24:15,328
I promise, I won't laugh.

350
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:16,847
Promise?

351
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:23,631
I'd like to be a Benihana chef...

352
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:24,928
in Hawaii.

353
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:32,174
I know. It's stupid.

354
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:34,889
It's not stupid.

355
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,641
It's totally attainable.

356
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,789
No, it's not.

357
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:40,008
You have to train for,
like, years, okay?

358
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:42,352
I'm way past my prime,
I am not Asian

359
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,732
and I don't even know
where to get the knives.

360
00:24:44,996 --> 00:24:46,496
<i>Ass Man, I need you.</i>

361
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,807
Ass Man on his way.

362
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:09,161
<i>We ran a thermal satellite scan
of the coordinates,</i>

363
00:25:09,286 --> 00:25:10,591
<i>and activity was present.</i>

364
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,261
<i>It seems Fulcrum has moved
their operation underground.</i>

365
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:16,708
Bartowski was right. We sending in
a team to rescue his father?

366
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,100
<i>We don't have time for that.
I've ordered F-16s</i>

367
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,939
<i>- to annihilate the site.</i>
- But I gave my word.

368
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:24,404
<i>I have not come to this decision
lightly.</i>

369
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,229
<i>We have no other choice.</i>

370
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,649
Chuck's a spy.

371
00:25:34,926 --> 00:25:35,926
Stay cool.

372
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:40,163
There you are.

373
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,707
Did you learn anything
about Chuck at the Buy More?

374
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,955
He's supposed to pick up
your parents at the airport.

375
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,531
Honey? Why are you
just looking at me like that?

376
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:51,021
It's a really simple question.
Have you talked to Chuck?

377
00:25:54,912 --> 00:25:57,305
- He's fine, yeah.
- So you spoke to him?

378
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,420
Definitely not.

379
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,478
Someone else spoke to him?

380
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,753
Who?

381
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Honey.

382
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:12,285
I need you to focus, okay?
No wedding day jitters!

383
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,027
We've got company coming any moment,

384
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:15,656
my father and my brother are MIA,

385
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,867
so I just need you
to pull it together.

386
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,835
Can you be Awesome for me?

387
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,539
Good.

388
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:26,395
You focus! Focus!
I need your A game.

389
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:42,316
- No gun for me?
- No. You get to stay in the car.

390
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,723
The whole stay in the car bit?
Aren't we past this?

391
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:47,540
I think I'm perfectly capable
of handling myself on a mission.

392
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,357
What, Agent Imbecile?

393
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,067
- Drop it.
- You drop it.

394
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,244
No! I've come this far.
If he stop me, he'll have to kill me.

395
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:56,922
Beckman called an air strike.
It'll be here in 20 min.

396
00:26:57,047 --> 00:27:00,451
What? Casey, my father is here!
You said you would rescue him.

397
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,101
You gave me your word.

398
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:08,316
But that didn't meant something.
I guess I have a lot to learn.

399
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:09,613
Yeah, you do.

400
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:11,629
You made three crucial mistakes.

401
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,460
You don't realize you were being trailed
for last half hour,

402
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,840
you didn't bring nearly
enough firepower,

403
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,249
and you didn't ask me to join.

404
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,855
Would you like to help us
rescue my father?

405
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:34,151
Your father served the country honorably
and deserves to go to the wedding.

406
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,528
- It's a yes?
- But,

407
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,655
he stays in the car.
- Agreed.

408
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,646
Done.

409
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:41,635
The team's back together again!
Group hug!

410
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,375
- One more step, it'll be your last.
- In the car I go.

411
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:54,714
Aces, Charles. Aces.

412
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,878
How's my favorite underachieving,
reclusive, kidnapped scientist?

413
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:03,574
It's done.
There's your Intersect.

414
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,808
You're a dream.

415
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:07,310
There is...

416
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:09,228
one request.

417
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:11,981
Anything that won't inconvenience me
is fine, I don't care.

418
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:14,483
Leave my family alone.

419
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,235
I'm not invited to the wedding?

420
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,613
- How did you know...?
- I'm in a conglomerate of bad guys.

421
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,741
Few details escape me.

422
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:24,327
Stevie, this works,

423
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,871
you have nothing to worry about.
It's a little tart in here.

424
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:30,708
I'll send down some air freshener.

425
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,053
Definitely staying in the car.

426
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,735
I had no idea <i>Tron</i> was so popular.

427
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:18,172
Welcome!
I see you all found your way.

428
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,077
Directions were good.

429
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:23,085
You have all have been
carefully selected by Fulcrum

430
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,353
to be the next generation
of Intersect agents.

431
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,919
More capable than any computer.

432
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,010
More efficient
than any spy in history.

433
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:37,566
Welcome to the future!
Can you dig it?

434
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,947
That's not what I was hoping for.

435
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:44,657
Can you dig it?

436
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,521
My God!

437
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,498
He's using the Intersect
to build an army.

438
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:55,042
Can you dig it?!

439
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:03,217
<i>The program will begin
in three minutes.</i>

440
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,914
3 minutes.

441
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:17,731
You fellas have a cigar for me?

442
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,480
- Don't you hate smoke?
- I figure if I'm gonna die,

443
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:23,054
I might see
what all the fuss is about.

444
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:32,271
Keys.

445
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:39,336
Go! There's an air strike
headed this way.

446
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:44,842
<i>Three minutes to target, general.
Prepping weapon systems.</i>

447
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,056
"Gone to stop Roark.
Be back in five. Chuck."

448
00:30:58,639 --> 00:30:59,850
I'm gonna kill him.

449
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:03,486
Don't worry, Agent Casey,
we'll take care of that.

450
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,613
The prodigal son returns.

451
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,835
Thank you for saving me
the trouble of hunting you down.

452
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,380
My pleasure.

453
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:25,426
Move it.

454
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:28,469
Great, the gang's all here.

455
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:32,598
It's only fair that a son should see
the results of his father's labor.

456
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:34,975
Of course if this doesn't work,

457
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:38,646
I'm afraid I have to go back
to that bit where I kill everybody.

458
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:40,934
- If it does work?
- If it does work,

459
00:31:41,673 --> 00:31:44,554
Same result, but,
you should root for it.

460
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:47,196
I mean, nobody likes a cynic.

461
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,824
Let's get right to the countdown,
shall we?

462
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,035
Five... four...

463
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:55,512
Three... I'm excited.

464
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:57,456
Two...

465
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,042
Casey! Sarah! Shut your eyes!

466
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:04,713
Keep them closed.

467
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:11,887
Chuck, look at the screen.

468
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,889
No, Dad, I don't want a refresh.
I want this nightmare to be over.

469
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:18,853
I know, that's why I made this for you.
It's all for you.

470
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:21,605
Trust me, son.

471
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:52,678
What a rush! What a rush!

472
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,805
I got to flash.

473
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,521
I got to flash.

474
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:03,314
I'm not flashing. I'm not flashing!
It's not working!

475
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,066
There must be a glitch.
I'll have to take it back to the lab.

476
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,234
No more labs!

477
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:08,861
A deal is a deal!

478
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,863
Your son is dead! Get him up.

479
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,522
What's that?

480
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:32,968
I've got Chuck.
Let's get out of here. Come on!

481
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,347
Chuck, are you okay?

482
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:13,580
I feel...

483
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,054
I feel different. Lighter.

484
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,014
It worked.

485
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,816
- What worked?
- This.

486
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:25,323
I programmed it to remove
the Intersect from Chuck's head.

487
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:27,523
What do you mean "remove"?

488
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,358
The Intersect is out.

489
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:32,642
It's over, Chuck.

490
00:34:34,318 --> 00:34:35,557
You're free, son.

491
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,845
<i>Colonel Casey, </i>

492
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,442
<i>am I to understand
that you rescued Mr. Bartowski,</i>

493
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,874
<i>recovered the Intersect cube</i>

494
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:57,302
<i>and destroyed
Fulcrum's operation base?</i>

495
00:34:57,641 --> 00:35:00,931
- That's correct.
<i>- I should be promoting you to general.</i>

496
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:02,766
Actually,

497
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:05,853
Walker's the one responsible
for the success of the mission.

498
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:07,813
She pretended to go AWOL.

499
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,142
Used herself and the asset as bait
to lure Fulcrum out

500
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:11,860
so we could secure their location.

501
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,311
She risked her life
to the integrity of the mission.

502
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:17,072
If anyone deserves a commendation,
it's Walker.

503
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,032
Actually, General, I never...

504
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,164
Never thought she could be so cold.
I mean, I didn't, certainly.

505
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,663
She used me as bait,
like Casey just said.

506
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,206
Treated terribly, you know.

507
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,456
She cuffed me,
I had chaffing on my wrists.

508
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:29,792
I was malnourished.

509
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:33,297
It was... it was... horrific.

510
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:37,485
<i>Well, then, Colonel Casey,</i>

511
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,678
<i>now that the "Intersect project"
is over,</i>

512
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:41,972
<i>I assume you want to command
your old unit?</i>

513
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:45,860
Sorry, I just want to make sure
I didn't misinterpret anything.

514
00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:49,021
Did you just say "over"?

515
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:52,191
<i>That's correct.
We have the Intersect cube,</i>

516
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,751
<i>Fulcrum is defeated,
your mission complete.</i>

517
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,756
<i>Mr. Bartowski,
you are free to return to...</i>

518
00:35:58,977 --> 00:36:00,449
whatever it is you do.

519
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,786
General, I'd...
I'd just like to say

520
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:07,081
that although I know we've had
our share of ups and downs,

521
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,960
this has been an incredible,
dare I say,

522
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,670
life-changing experience...

523
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:18,570
that you don't feel quite
as strongly about. I get it, you busy.

524
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:20,803
Government... It's a little rude.

525
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,543
Why are the Brothers Imbecile
still working here?

526
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:27,601
Can we just give them
one more chance, please?

527
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,909
You know what, Grimes,
I'm gonna ask you

528
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:33,950
a very important question.

529
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:36,901
And I want you to think very long

530
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:38,862
and hard, about it.

531
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:42,366
Do you want to be a loser
the rest of your life?

532
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,214
Excellent question.

533
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:49,248
If you had asked me that
this morning,

534
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,455
I probably would have said yes.

535
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:54,795
Now, I'm not so sure.

536
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,297
Then do what needs to be done.

537
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,384
Yes, sir.

538
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:08,603
Big Mike, in the old country,

539
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,145
if a man did the honorable thing
and he fell on his own sword,

540
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:14,868
- his family was looked after.
- That was a good break.

541
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,317
Real nice deal.

542
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,197
- Will you look after my mother?
- I will.

543
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:23,909
Gentlemen,

544
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,190
it's been a pleasure
serving with you.

545
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,206
If you retell the story,
do me a favor

546
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,036
give me a better physique.

547
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,429
What are you doing?

548
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:38,630
Morgan out.

549
00:37:50,023 --> 00:37:52,109
Will you come to Hawaii with me,

550
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:54,359
where I will learn
the ancient art of hibachi?

551
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:58,192
Morgan, I thought you'd never ask.

552
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:04,299
This is so great.

553
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,177
One second, hold on.

554
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,093
- A little hot in here, buddy?
- It's a bit chilly but...

555
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:20,422
- worth it.
- Is everything okay?

556
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,136
Yeah. No, dude, actually,

557
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,643
for the first time,
everything is fine.

558
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,432
It's all over.

559
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:34,519
God, I admire him.

560
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,501
You're free, Morgan!

561
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:56,953
You're free!

562
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:04,659
Babe,

563
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,760
we are late. We have to go.

564
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:09,208
I can't.

565
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,765
We have a rehearsal dinner
full of people waiting for us.

566
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:14,768
I knew that my dad
would disappoint me,

567
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,395
but, not Chuck.

568
00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:18,981
I don't know, it must be in the DNA.

569
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:29,574
I know it's difficult without Chuck,

570
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:32,618
but he wants to be here,
I know he does.

571
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:36,607
Your dad leaving
shook him up pretty bad.

572
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:40,596
Ellie, he'll be back.

573
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:44,169
Trust me... he loves you.

574
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,800
So do I.

575
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:53,557
Chuck, where have you been?

576
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,372
I was getting your wedding present.

577
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:57,987
Dad...

578
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:03,705
Are you staying?

579
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:05,945
I'm not going anywhere.

580
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:09,661
I got your back, bro.

581
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:29,146
I was wondering if you...

582
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:31,845
wanted to come
to my sister's rehearsal dinner.

583
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:33,782
The Intersect's out, Bartowski.

584
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,496
- You don't need my help anymore.
- I'm not asking you as the asset,

585
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,561
but as a friend.

586
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:47,368
Okay, well, I tried.

587
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:52,906
Open bar, I hope.

588
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:00,540
I'll go warm up the Vic.

589
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,423
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

590
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,807
- Very dapper.
- Thank you.

591
00:41:17,948 --> 00:41:19,334
So how does it feel?

592
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,265
It feels great, actually.

593
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:26,733
Like everything is finally real.

594
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:29,681
It is real.

595
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:55,837
Where you headed?

596
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:00,363
Got a wedding to go to.
