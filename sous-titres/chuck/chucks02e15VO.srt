1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:01,325
Hey, I'm Chuck.

2
00:00:01,408 --> 00:00:04,065
Here's a couple of things you might
need to know or maybe you just forgot.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,403
You're not going to
need any help, are you?

4
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,204
I'm gonna need that back.

5
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:12,219
Sarah and I aren't going to be
seeing each other right now

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,544
We know Chuck could have
FULCRUM's program in him.

7
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,222
Who's the stiff?

8
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:57,031
The corpse was dug up
from a CIA dump site.

9
00:00:57,114 --> 00:00:59,007
The grave belonged to Brad White.

10
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:02,038
That's one of the FULCRUM agents
who ran the Intersect test on Chuck.

11
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,021
Why would they rob his grave?

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,766
That's what we need you to find out.

13
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,652
We picked up chatter
that whatever they took

14
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,602
is potentially
game-changing intelligence.

15
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,600
You want us to grab Chuck,
keep him underground?

16
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:13,353
I don't think that's necessary yet,

17
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:15,158
but keep a close eye on the asset

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,874
until we have further information.

19
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:18,860
Don't let him out of your sight.

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,520
Chuck, it's Sarah.
Don't you want to answer it?

21
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,016
I'm going to...

22
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,958
see her later anyway, so...

23
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:30,965
Yeah.

24
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,786
Sometimes you got
to play hard to get.

25
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,594
Cold and detached is a very
powerful aphrodisiac, babe.

26
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,805
So is abstinence.
You want to try it?

27
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:42,268
- Not getting involved.
- Chuck, the other night,

28
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,104
you said some pretty heavy things
about Sarah about her not being the one.

29
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,130
Well, you know, I mean,
we've got our issues.

30
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,447
But don't... don't worry, sis;
it will all work itself out.

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,799
No, Chuck, it won't.

32
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:54,286
That's what you always say.

33
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,756
You have to take control

34
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,956
of your life if you want
to move forward.

35
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:00,376
You said you'd work
at the Buy More temporarily.

36
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,070
It's been...
it's been five years.

37
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,331
It's-it's just...

38
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,521
it's not so easy breaking up
with Sarah Walker, you know.

39
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:09,228
It's, uh...
it's a little complicated.

40
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:11,145
I know.
I know, and I love Sarah.

41
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:13,176
I just think
that if she's not the one,

42
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,700
you got to tell her.

43
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:16,903
You're not just hurting her.
You're hurting yourself.

44
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:19,513
<i>Dude, do you have any idea
what it's like to be in a relationship</i>

45
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:20,659
that's so upsetting

46
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,446
that it just keeps you up at night?

47
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:24,891
- Vaguely familiar.
- I don't think you do, man.

48
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,380
Look at me.
I haven't slept in days.

49
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:29,952
You know, if I don't get at least
12 hours, I'm a basket case.

50
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:31,309
Something wrong with Anna?

51
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,244
She's out of town.
We're actually really good.

52
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,002
No, it's my mom and Big Mike, dude.

53
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:38,637
They're like teenagers. They just keep
going at it and keep going at it.

54
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,510
The man moans like
a wounded sea lion.

55
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,636
Anyway, I was just wondering

56
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,698
if I could just crash with you for a
little till this whole thing blows over.

57
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,603
- I'll run it by Ellie and Awesome.
- Thank you, thank you.

58
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:02,782
- Screening my calls?
- Hey... no, no.

59
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:04,424
Yes, a little.

60
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:07,186
I've been meaning to talk to you.

61
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,125
I just... I was waiting
for the right time,

62
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,952
and I've been really
slammed here at work.

63
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,892
Can I buy you a frozen yogurt?

64
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:13,818
Sure.

65
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,833
So, what did you want to talk about?

66
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,932
You can go first. Mine's spy-related,
and I have a feeling yours isn't.

67
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,665
I wanted to talk about us.

68
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,500
You want to break up again.

69
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,253
I caught some chatter
through bites of cereal

70
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,671
on the surveillance tap.

71
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,649
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

72
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:39,285
Of course.

73
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:40,586
Look...

74
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,989
Sarah, it's not you.

75
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:43,889
It's me.

76
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,599
Probably not the best idea to give the
"It's not you, it's me" speech

77
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:48,686
- to a trained assassin wielding a knife.
- I was warming up

78
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,223
into more original terrain.

79
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,158
Can you give us a minute,
please, Casey?

80
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:58,943
Look, Sarah, you know how much
I care about you.

81
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:01,907
It's just getting so complicated
lying to my sister

82
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,660
and my friends. Sometimes,
I don't even know what lie I'm telling.

83
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,829
Look, tell them
we're taking things slowly

84
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,847
and that while we enjoy
each other's company,

85
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,937
we don't really feel the need
to label it, and...

86
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,460
who knows what
the future holds for us?

87
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,773
But that's... that's just
another lie, isn't it?

88
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,406
We'll never really be together.

89
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:23,345
Exactly.

90
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,332
Exactly, and that's why
I think we should break up.

91
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:28,080
Is that what you really want?

92
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:29,977
Yes, it is.

93
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,897
Great... most annoying romance
of my life is finally over.

94
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,719
Downstairs now.
Come on.

95
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,193
<i>We were able to lift a print
off the body bag.</i>

96
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,974
<i>It seems the grave was robbed
by a FULCRUM agent, Cole Barker.</i>

97
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,018
Seems like a real ladies' man.

98
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:47,802
<i>He arrived at LAX this morning</i>

99
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:49,608
<i>and took a cab
to the Standard Hotel.</i>

100
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,211
<i>We suspect that's where he's going</i>

101
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:53,823
<i>to meet his FULCRUM <i></i>contact later
and make a handoff.</i>

102
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:56,211
<i>Agent Walker will attempt
to retrieve the intelligence</i>

103
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,332
<i>he's carrying
using any means necessary.</i>

104
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,049
<i>That's all.</i>

105
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:06,472
Can we get a little closer

106
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,208
on this picture of Cole,
maybe push in on his...

107
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,025
"groinal" area?

108
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,314
What, you seeing something you like
down there, Bartowski?

109
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,733
Okay, I just flashed,

110
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,042
and the intelligence
is in Cole's belt buckle.

111
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:33,123
You're going to have
to get his pants off, Walker?

112
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,036
Good thing Bartowski dumped you.

113
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,630
<i>Les Subbers in Black présentent...</i>

114
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,760
<i>Transcript : LeapinLar
Synchro : Job22, JJbrqmz</i>

115
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:17,586
Grimes.

116
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,155
Or should I call you son?

117
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:21,922
Who the hell are all those geeks
over there at the customer service desk?

118
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,175
You were supposed to hire
a new green shirt today.

119
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,101
You want to do the interview?

120
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:30,681
Get a little taste of what the power
of management is?

121
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,234
Why can't you do it?

122
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,670
Well, your mama asked me
to stop by the house today

123
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,151
and take care of a few things.

124
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,140
There hasn't been
a man around there in a while,

125
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:41,077
and certain things
have become neglected.

126
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,207
Like what?

127
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,981
Uh, the...
the plumbing's a mess.

128
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,248
I got to get over there,
and I got to lay down some pipe.

129
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:50,286
I got to snake the drains,

130
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,989
make sure everything
is running smoothly again.

131
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,726
You're in charge, son.
Just think.

132
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:59,110
All this could be yours some day.

133
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,349
I wish we could hire
a green shirt that looked like that.

134
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,636
Buddy, if you got too much
on your plate emotionally,

135
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,607
Jeff and I can help out
with the interviews.

136
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,211
That's, um, oddly sensitive of you
and I appreciate it, thank you.

137
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:17,352
Absolutely.

138
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,158
You know what I'm thinking?

139
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,565
Casting couch.

140
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,220
Follow me.

141
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,015
<i>I kind of like her.</i>

142
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:28,257
And her.

143
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,192
Wait... why are these babes

144
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,827
going to get busy with us again?

145
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,929
The casting couch
is a long-honored tradition

146
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:35,257
between men and women.

147
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,164
We offer fame and fortune.

148
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:39,702
They offer themselves.

149
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,437
For a job as a green shirt?

150
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,940
Ah...
for the opportunity of a lifetime.

151
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:48,967
A high-paying modeling job
at Burbank's finest electronics store.

152
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,553
May I present to you...

153
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,232
the Buy More babe.

154
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,336
Lester, you're a genius.

155
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:12,950
Game on.
Beefcake just stepped in.

156
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,732
Where is his contact?

157
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:26,819
Do I have an Intersect
in my head? Look around.

158
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,091
We don't have much time here,
Walker, so get to his room.

159
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,509
Get his belt off.

160
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,612
Make it a quickie.

161
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,356
M-maybe there's a...

162
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,117
maybe there's
a better way to do this.

163
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:38,892
Throw a sack over his head,
drag him outside.

164
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,907
Come on, Casey, you're always up
for a good mugging.

165
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,933
Can't risk his contact seeing it.

166
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,942
What's the matter, Bartowski?
Afraid of a little competition?

167
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,045
Morgan, what are you doing here?

168
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:54,443
Chuck didn't tell you?

169
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,403
This is kind of embarrassing.

170
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:59,810
- My mom is, uh...
- ... romantically

171
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:01,731
involved with my boss from work.

172
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:03,159
So I need a place to stay.

173
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,002
Big Mike's boning Bolonia?

174
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,337
Gross, honey.
Morgan, look, uh...

175
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,125
No, listen, El, El...
it'll just be for a few days.

176
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,342
and I promise I will earn my keep.

177
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,053
I've already taken the liberty
of drawing a very hot bubble bath.

178
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,317
And ice-cold martinis.

179
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,754
Dry with olives!

180
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:26,339
- Thank you.
- Now, off to the tub with you.

181
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:29,369
The roast will be
out of the oven soon.

182
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:31,695
A roast is in the oven.

183
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:38,368
Cole's FULCRUM contact's going
to be here any minute.

184
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,078
Time to let it all hang out?

185
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,461
I'm just wondering
if it's safe for Sarah

186
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:44,630
to be alone with
such a dangerous guy.

187
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,734
It's okay, Chuck.
I've got protection.

188
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,004
And besides, we have a safe word.

189
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,792
If I ask for any Cristal champagne,

190
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,395
Casey will know I'm in trouble.

191
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,593
She'll be fine.
Trust me.

192
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:57,088
It's not like it's her first time.

193
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:04,102
Hi.

194
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:06,772
I noticed you sitting alone.

195
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:07,981
Very observant.

196
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,910
Do you want some company?

197
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:11,483
Not really.

198
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:13,403
Well, neither do I.

199
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,156
But, uh, the problem is,
if I sit alone at the bar,

200
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,284
then every guy in here is going to think
I'm lonely and desperate,

201
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,867
and try and take a shot
at a total stranger.

202
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,281
Isn't that what
you're doing right now?

203
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:26,561
Guilty as charged.

204
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:28,565
If we're going to continue
this conversation,

205
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:31,821
I think I should make
one thing abundantly clear.

206
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,674
I'm not a very nice guy.

207
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,479
Good... 'cause I'm not
into nice guys.

208
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:38,591
Really?

209
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:41,431
Why is that?

210
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,476
Well, all they want to do
is talk about their feelings

211
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,605
and emotions, and sometimes what a woman
really wants is a man who acts.

212
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,840
Well, then why don't we stop talking

213
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,998
and take this up to my room?

214
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:56,321
You have my word:
nothing nice will happen.

215
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,282
Good girl, Walker.

216
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,665
- What floor?
- Hit 11.

217
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,576
Here we go.
Hot plate.

218
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,488
This is incredible, Morgan.
It is truly awesome.

219
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,431
You know, food is kind of like
a seductress.

220
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,126
Let me give you a little tidbit.

221
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,797
I scored Anna by serving myself...

222
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,432
"À la mode."

223
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,809
It's just a shame
that Chuck couldn't be here.

224
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,066
Although, I'm pretty sure
he's probably enjoying

225
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:37,488
his own delicious, little meal
right about now.

226
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:40,572
Of course I mean Sarah Walker.

227
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,560
Yeah, if he hasn't broken up
with her yet.

228
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:47,622
Why on God's green Earth would he ever,
ever break up with Sarah?

229
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:50,042
Ask Ellie.
It was her idea.

230
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,578
- Really?
- What?

231
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,503
He said that he didn't think
she was the one.

232
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,499
There are a few precious things

233
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,315
I know anything about in this world.

234
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:58,592
Chuck's one of them.

235
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,866
- Believe me, Sarah's the one.
- How do you know?

236
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,097
How do I know?
It's all over the kid's face.

237
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,141
When Chuck is around Sarah,
he is the Chuck

238
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,581
that we always dreamed of.

239
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:10,888
The Chuck that has the potential
to do anything in the world.

240
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,982
Maybe I shouldn't have told
Chuck to break up with Sarah.

241
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,760
Look at the bright side, honey:

242
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,940
Chuck said he was moving out
years ago.

243
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:20,739
It'll probably be years before he gets
around to breaking up with her.

244
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,073
<i>Which room is yours?</i>

245
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:25,237
<i>1121.
It's a suite with a fantastic view,</i>

246
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:29,137
<i>giant king-sized bed
and a Jacuzzi tub.</i>

247
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,207
You okay?

248
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,728
Who me? Yeah, yeah.

249
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,992
I'm-I'm fine.
Just curious if I'll be home

250
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:36,338
in time for <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

251
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,882
Maybe you shouldn't listen.

252
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,259
- Let's take that earwig.
- I will listen in case

253
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,054
I flash on something.

254
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,175
Like right now.

255
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:54,773
Casey! The two suits getting
into the elevator right now;

256
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:55,818
they're FULCRUM.

257
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,149
They could be the contact.

258
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:58,452
You stay here.

259
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,736
I'll handle this.

260
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:03,107
Hey, guys.

261
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,371
Could you hit 8?

262
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,294
Here we are.

263
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,162
Not so fast, honey.

264
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,267
<i>I usually don't do this
on a first date.</i>

265
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,890
Right, me, either.

266
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,009
Let me get a little
something from my purse.

267
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,917
I've got everything we need.

268
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,580
I hope this isn't too rough.

269
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,260
Bartender, something
really strong, please.

270
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,721
Let's get this belt off.

271
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:13,560
Whoa, slow down, tiger.

272
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,013
I told you I wasn't a nice guy.

273
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:25,641
Okay, hands up! NSA.

274
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,188
It'll be okay, ma'am.

275
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,205
Step off the elevator
with your baby.

276
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,161
Please, just don't shoot.

277
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,598
I'm willing to try new things,
but it's getting a little hot in here.

278
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,645
I wonder if we could
maybe grab some champagne?

279
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,473
Maybe some Cristal?

280
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:57,621
Well, then let's get some Cristal.

281
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:02,993
Ah, tasty.
Hit me again.

282
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,212
Hey, I need a bottle
of Cristal for suite 1121.

283
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,796
Casey, I heard the safe word.
I think Sarah's in real trouble.

284
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,565
I got my own problems, Chuck.

285
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,449
Don't be a hero.
Get out of here!

286
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,413
Okay.

287
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,584
This is getting a little
too dangerous for me right now.

288
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,753
Enough games, sweetheart.

289
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,136
Who do you work for?

290
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,295
<i>Somebody order room service?</i>
<i>Champagne?</i>

291
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:24,691
Maybe you should put your dress on

292
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,806
'cause it's,
a little chilly in here.

293
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,664
We've got the belt and Agent Barker,
and we're heading to the car.

294
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,278
You guys are making a huge mistake.

295
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:41,533
You just keep your mouth shut,
we'll deal with you later.

296
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,331
Won't be a later
unless you listen to me.

297
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:45,140
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

298
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:48,089
Do you think I'm falling for this?
Trust me, you're not that charming.

299
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,302
That's not our ride.

300
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,675
Who are they?

301
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,417
Not ours.
Okay, you stay here.

302
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,361
I'm going to try and pull fire
away from you.

303
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:04,490
Casey, it's Sarah.
We need help, now!

304
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:12,031
Okay, listen to me clearly.
I'm not a FULCRUM agent.

305
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,448
I'm MI6 working undercover.

306
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,588
- Why didn't you say anything before?!
- 'Cause I didn't want to blow my cover.

307
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,667
How do I know you're not lying?

308
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,795
You don't, but if you want her to live,
you don't have a choice.

309
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,376
Do something or she's already dead.

310
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,570
Get down!

311
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:18,826
Come with me if you want to live.

312
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,802
You're not going anywhere.

313
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:33,419
<i>I want to apologize to you directly,
Agent Barker.</i>

314
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,714
<i>We had no record you were MI6.</i>

315
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:39,159
You people just blew 18 months
of undercover work.

316
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,303
We did recover the stolen
intelligence, didn't we?

317
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,288
I mean it wasn't...
it wasn't a complete loss.

318
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,290
I'm just saying it wasn't
a complete loss.

319
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,709
Whatever information
is on that chip is useless

320
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,644
- without the playback device.
- Why?

321
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,007
FULCRUM devised a system

322
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,719
to ensure that critical information,
if intercepted, couldn't be read.

323
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,055
My mission was to bring the chip
to my contact and find out what's on it.

324
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,011
To do that,
we need the playback device.

325
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:05,810
<i>I'm ordering you to stay locked down
in Castle tonight, Agent Barker,</i>

326
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,281
<i>until we speak to your superiors
and figure out our next move.</i>

327
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:11,092
<i>Agent Walker will stay with you.</i>

328
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:13,968
Make sure you don't get yourself
into any more trouble.

329
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:18,691
I could think of worse ways
to spend the night.

330
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,308
Funny, but I can't think of any.

331
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:22,410
You could stay at my house

332
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,703
if you wanted to.

333
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,997
My best friend, Morgan,
is sleeping on the sofa.

334
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,957
I don't think
he'd mind if you were there.

335
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,308
He has a beard... like yours.

336
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,529
What's up, babe?
Couldn't sleep?

337
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,529
What's up, babe?
Couldn't sleep?

338
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,095
I'm worried about Chuck.

339
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:01,760
I'm afraid I shouldn't have pushed him
to break up with Sarah.

340
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:04,244
Well, he's not home.

341
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,342
That's a good sign
if you know what I mean.

342
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:09,332
Come on, I'll make you a cup of tea.
It'll help you sleep.

343
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,297
- Whoa!
- Ah!

344
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:17,807
Evening.

345
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,509
Talk about low-hanging fruit.

346
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,426
Oh, my God, I'm going to kill Chuck.

347
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,416
No, didn't Chuck tell you
I sleep in the buff?

348
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:26,273
I mean, that's just... hey, come on.
Big guy, where are you going?

349
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:28,058
It's not a big deal, but...

350
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:29,776
you know what I'm saying.

351
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,414
Right, um, so are you,
are you sure that you're okay

352
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:40,579
alone with this guy,
'cause I don't mind staying?

353
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:42,494
Go home, Chuck, and get some sleep.

354
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:45,071
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Okay.

355
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:48,605
Oh, hey, Chuck?

356
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,708
- You got a second?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

357
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,929
So, um, what's the deal
with you two?

358
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,397
Us two?
It's,...

359
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,841
you know,
it's purely professional. Why?

360
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:01,493
Uh, 'cause she's hot.

361
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,547
Since there's nothing
going on between you,

362
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,117
I'm going to try

363
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,844
and butter that muffin.

364
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:16,352
Hey. Morning.

365
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,117
Aren't we missing a houseguest?

366
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:21,717
Honey, honey, it'll be okay.

367
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:23,907
Your boy dropped trou last night.

368
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,834
- Excuse me?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,869
The bearded buffoon
sleeps au naturel,

370
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,555
which I respect,
just not on my couch.

371
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:33,499
Appetite gone.
I am so, so sorry.

372
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,112
Yes, let's, uh...
let's just forget about it.

373
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,618
Did you talk to Sarah?

374
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,061
I did,

375
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:42,764
and we've decided that
we're just going to be friends.

376
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:44,385
Oh.

377
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,793
Oh. Oh. Oh, what?

378
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:48,533
What, "Oh?" Didn't you say that I should
break up with her, that I needed

379
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:50,926
to move forward with my life?
Do you remember saying that?

380
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,328
Yeah, I do. I do remember
saying that. Um,...

381
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:55,079
I just think that once
you let her go,

382
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:57,273
it's gonna be really hard
to get her back.

383
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,002
Ba-Back? Why would I need
to get her back?

384
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,016
What she means is that, um,

385
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,074
a babe like her is not going to be
on the market for long, bro.

386
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,911
Seriously, Chuck,
what were you thinking?

387
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,598
Good morning, darling.

388
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:33,261
How come you never came
to bed last night?

389
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:35,353
I didn't feel like sleep.

390
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,480
Who said anything about sleeping?

391
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,660
Let me make this very clear.

392
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:42,276
I'm not interested.

393
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,938
Me, neither.

394
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:46,114
I just think your seduction

395
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,450
skills could use a little work,
and I'm offering my services.

396
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,830
Well, you seemed pretty reluctant
in your hotel suite last night.

397
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,615
Well, I didn't want
to blow the cover.

398
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,377
<i>Sarah? Cole?</i>

399
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:01,248
Cole.

400
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,477
Look, I'm not saying

401
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,871
you don't possess the
necessary instruments.

402
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:17,808
You've just been a bit out of practice.
I mean, look at this place.

403
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:19,532
Locked up in this dungeon.

404
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,607
It's like keeping a Boticelli
in the basement.

405
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,741
No one can appreciate the beauty.

406
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,490
Get dressed.

407
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,647
As you wish.

408
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:39,125
Oh. Impressive.

409
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:46,043
- Come here.
- What?

410
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,462
I'm gonna think about it some more.

411
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:57,810
Next applicant.

412
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:05,523
So, my agent says that the salary is
between four and seven figures?

413
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:08,755
We are not at liberty to
discuss numbers, I'm afraid.

414
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:11,532
It means it's completely negotiable.

415
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,621
- Are you not wearing any underwear?
- I don't know. Am I?

416
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:20,750
I'm confused.

417
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,352
Are you the owners?

418
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:23,920
No. No, no, no, no, no.

419
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,923
Our acquaintance's mother is sleeping
with the store manager, so, basically...

420
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,542
Don't think of us as bosses.

421
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:33,026
Think of us as bosses
with privileges.

422
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,309
Does your building
have a security access code?

423
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,355
He's just... Late-night emergencies
are common in this line of work.

424
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,645
So, if you're looking
for a sales associate, then

425
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,820
why do you need
to hire a swimsuit model?

426
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,405
I nearly have a degree in
business from the El Segundo

427
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,601
School of Finance, so,

428
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:55,910
some of these concepts
might be over your head.

429
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,776
I have a business degree
from Harvard.

430
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:58,664
Ah.

431
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:00,950
Friendly rivalry.

432
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,126
- I'm calling my boyfriend.
- Oh.

433
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,817
I'm calling the police.

434
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,099
Who's in charge here?

435
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:10,483
- Chuck!
- Chuck!

436
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,021
So, if we can't open it,
how do we get the playback device?

437
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:16,083
Well, maybe I can hack the chip.

438
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,379
I've cracked a data drive
or two in my day.

439
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:19,517
Not like this.

440
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,464
It's a little more complicated than you
and your friends stealing video games.

441
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:25,448
Yeah. Don't try to be a hero on this one,
Bartowski. Leave that to the pros.

442
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:26,819
Excuse me. I am a pro.

443
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,319
My job is a certified computer
and electronics technician.

444
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:31,492
Great cover.

445
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,216
It's not his cover.
It's his life.

446
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:35,725
Look, the only way we're gonna
read what's on that chip

447
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:38,819
is if we get the playback device.
Maybe my cover is still intact.

448
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:40,733
I'll call my contact
and arrange a new meet.

449
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:42,345
No. That's too dangerous.

450
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:44,500
Oh. It's sweet
that you're worried about me,

451
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,128
- but I can handle the heat.
- It's not that I'm worried about you.

452
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,416
It's the intelligence that is on that
chip falling into FULCRUM's hands.

453
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:51,966
Fine. I'll go without it.

454
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:54,416
Leave the chip here.
Worst case scenario:

455
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,947
we use this opportunity
to smoke out a few FULCRUM agents.

456
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,099
Worst case scenario:
they catch you and kill you.

457
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,152
Yeah.

458
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:03,060
Well, that's a chance
I'm just gonna have to take.

459
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,700
Sarah, give me a chance.
Maybe I can do this.

460
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,241
Chuck, just go back to the Buy More.
We'll call you when it's over.

461
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:22,574
Hey, don't worry, champ.

462
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:24,373
Lots of other fish in the sea.

463
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:28,144
And don't get cute
with that chip, Bartowski.

464
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,217
<i>You sure you know
how to handle that?</i>

465
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,719
<i>I think I can manage.</i>

466
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:34,969
<i>Will you?</i>

467
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,654
Oh, hey, buddy, listen. I need you
to smooth things out with your sis.

468
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:40,674
You know, just tell her
I'll wear pajama bottoms.

469
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:42,790
Not now, Morgan.
I'm in the middle of something.

470
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,645
- Hi. Are you Chuck?
- Yeah. How can I help you?

471
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,445
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

472
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:48,549
Oh...

473
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,675
I told Jeff and Lester to hire
the new green shirt,

474
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:56,731
and I guess they took
a few liberties.

475
00:26:57,538 --> 00:26:58,771
I'm sure they did.

476
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:05,935
<i>My contact is late.</i>

477
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:07,875
<i>I don't see him anywhere
in this crowd.</i>

478
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,736
Any sign of FULCRUM?

479
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:13,589
Hard to tell.
They all look the same.

480
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:28,831
There they are.

481
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,082
We're on.

482
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:33,513
Signal Sarah when you see
the playback device.

483
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:34,902
Then we'll move in.

484
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,511
- You got the chip?
- You got the playback device?

485
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,603
Someone call for a professional?

486
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,861
Don't tell me to leave
the spy work to the spies.

487
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,390
I'll show them.

488
00:27:58,757 --> 00:27:59,583
Wait.

489
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,723
Someone just tripped the homing
device on the microchip.

490
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,448
This guy doesn't have it.
It's coming from Burbank.

491
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,312
It's a setup.
Kill him.

492
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,640
Casey, gun.

493
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,531
Hold your position, Walker.
That's an order.

494
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:15,188
Cole could be in danger.

495
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:18,029
He's off the grid.
We're not authorized to be here.

496
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,530
Get back here.

497
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,907
- Drop it.
- No, you drop it.

498
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,305
Don't move.

499
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:33,023
They almost fooled us until someone
tried to hack into the real chip.

500
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:34,795
Bartowski.

501
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,983
And they said it couldn't be done.

502
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,430
That's when they call in
the real pros, isn't it?

503
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,232
Oh, my... God.

504
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,338
Check it out.

505
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,868
- The fuzz.
- Oh, God...

506
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,999
One of those models must've
actually called the cops.

507
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:22,861
I told you not
to flash them, you perv!

508
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:24,766
The casting couch was your idea.

509
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,672
Hi.

510
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,059
Hi. Hi.

511
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:31,430
How can I help you?

512
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,696
Bartowski better lock it down.

513
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,533
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

514
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,228
That was dumb.

515
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,739
Why do people always insist
on doing things the hard way?

516
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,270
No, no.

517
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:47,495
I assure you, I, I don't.

518
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,621
What is the hard way?

519
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:55,233
Oh, my God!

520
00:29:55,316 --> 00:29:56,952
This is unbearable.

521
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,866
My back is killing me;
my wrists are chafing.

522
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,329
This is going to get ugly.

523
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:05,379
- What level is his pain tolerance?
- I'd say about a one out of ten.

524
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:07,393
A what?! A one?

525
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,682
I'd say I'm at least at an eight.

526
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,862
Chuck, the torture
hasn't started yet.

527
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:14,270
This is the pre-torture?

528
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,360
Okay, okay.
Put me down for a "one."

529
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:26,490
Sarah. Sarah.
I saw it.

530
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,868
- I know what's on the chip.
- What?

531
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,276
Uh, sorry, mate, it's a bit difficult
to put my fingers in my ears right now.

532
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:35,624
It's okay, Chuck.

533
00:30:36,722 --> 00:30:38,613
I'm on it. It's me.

534
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:40,796
Okay, we can't let
FULCRUM ever find out.

535
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,302
No matter what they do to you,
you cannot tell them.

536
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,542
I can't...
I can't handle torture, Sarah.

537
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,269
You see all those
syringes over there?

538
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:49,740
- You know how I feel about needles.
- Don't worry about torture.

539
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:51,938
I'll incite them.
Get them to kill us quick.

540
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:53,274
Interesting plan.

541
00:30:53,357 --> 00:30:55,635
Okay, we just have to hold
out until Casey gets here.

542
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:58,315
Until then, if the pain becomes
unbearable, just pass out.

543
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,995
- How?
- Scare yourself.

544
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,567
Shouldn't be too hard.

545
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,605
Glad to see you're all
in such a chatty mood.

546
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,270
The identity of the Intersect
is on that chip.

547
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,707
So who wants to tell me first?

548
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:22,697
Hey!

549
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,335
Ooh, nice suit.

550
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:26,884
Where you headed, a funeral?

551
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,553
Yeah, yours if you don't tell me
where Bartowski is.

552
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,694
- He got pinched.
- What?!

553
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,849
The cops nabbed him
for indecent exposure.

554
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,643
Guy can't keep it in his pants.

555
00:31:37,082 --> 00:31:38,099
What cops?

556
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,391
A hot woman,

557
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:41,273
real taskmaster type.

558
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,109
- She can frisk me anytime.
- Shut up, you idiot!

559
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,383
That's how we got in this mess
in the first place.

560
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,716
I would not like to share a cell
with that gentleman.

561
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,958
Stop it. Stop it. I can't take
it anymore. No more torture.

562
00:32:01,897 --> 00:32:04,009
She's torturing me, idiot.

563
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:06,958
Tell me who the Intersect is,
Cole...

564
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,537
and the pain can end.

565
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:16,934
Sarah, I can't let them do this.
She's going to kill him.

566
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,311
No, Chuck, no, just keep
your mouth shut.

567
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:21,989
Enough, enough, can't you see
he's never going to talk?

568
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,900
Everybody talks.

569
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:27,132
Cole knows that.

570
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:30,621
Well, how about it?

571
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:31,991
You ready to talk

572
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,133
or should I turn up the heat?

573
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,589
Look, I know what's on the chip.
I watched it.

574
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:44,944
No, Chuck, no!

575
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,304
It's me.

576
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:50,135
I'm the one you're looking for.

577
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,026
You?

578
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,461
All along it was you.

579
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,231
Do you really think the CIA would

580
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,233
put its entire database
of secrets inside

581
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,447
his head?
He's a pathetic weakling.

582
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:10,292
How could they send him
on an assignment?

583
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,448
How could he even withstand torture?

584
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,570
It's true, he's just a computer
and electronics technician

585
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:17,661
a brave one,
but he's not the Intersect.

586
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,038
Then who is?

587
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:20,123
Me.

588
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,917
I'm the Intersect.

589
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,422
No, he's not.

590
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,559
It's me, okay, and I resent the fact
that I couldn't stand up to torture.

591
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,386
Do your worst. In fact, you could
stick that incredibly long needle

592
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,710
in my eye and I still
wouldn't tell you anything.

593
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,975
This needle?

594
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:41,727
You want me

595
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:44,002
to put this needle...

596
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:45,898
in your eye?

597
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,846
Uh, uh, uh,
you know, you know, you know,

598
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:50,982
on, on, on second thought...

599
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:57,475
Wake him.

600
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,250
General, we have a situation.

601
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,155
I need surveillance
from a NASA satellite.

602
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:08,704
What's going on, Agent Casey?

603
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:11,367
FULCRUM has captured the asset.

604
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,039
I suspect he's being tortured.

605
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:15,433
Dear God, he'll never last.

606
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,908
It's freezing!
No, no, please.

607
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,934
- Please, no more torture.
- Enough.

608
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,590
We will try...

609
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:26,010
a different approach.

610
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,999
Tell me who the
Intersect is by three...

611
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,176
or I inject Agent Walker
with enough ricin to kill an army.

612
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:36,959
One,...

613
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:38,506
two...

614
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,319
- It's me.
<i>- It's me!</i>

615
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,500
<i>Freeze! CIA!
Hands in the air!</i>

616
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:49,795
Hey, hey.

617
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,426
Hands, now!

618
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:56,635
Up!

619
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,472
Our turn now.

620
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:03,434
We get to find out everything
you know about FULCRUM.

621
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,394
No, you won't.

622
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,058
Trust me, babe,

623
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,689
everyone talks.

624
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:10,649
I know.

625
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,234
No!

626
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:25,122
FULCRUM wins.

627
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,889
<i>Thank you.</i>

628
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:41,258
What happened?

629
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:43,479
Well,...

630
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,234
I fainted and hit my head
on the ground.

631
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:48,120
Real brave, Bartowski.

632
00:35:48,268 --> 00:35:50,063
I fainted on purpose.

633
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,765
That was my move.

634
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,609
You know I'm terrified of needles.

635
00:35:54,858 --> 00:35:57,141
Oh, so your move was to faint

636
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:59,117
and his was to endure torture?

637
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,116
We have different methods.

638
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,453
It looks like his method is working.

639
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,037
- Keep the ice on that.
- Oh, I'm fine.

640
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:22,632
I'm really proud of you, Chuck.
It's not easy to withstand torture.

641
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:24,695
Well, they didn't know
the right buttons to push.

642
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:26,734
I have exceptionally
ticklish toes, you know.

643
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,581
As a child, Ellie was able
to extract information from me at will.

644
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,403
Well, that's good to know.

645
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:35,397
Besides, you've had a lot
of practice enduring torture,

646
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,110
with our fake relationship.

647
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:44,212
You know, it wasn't
completely torture.

648
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,078
We certainly had our moments,
didn't we?

649
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:49,060
Well, even though it wasn't real,

650
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:50,999
I'm really going to miss it.

651
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:56,940
Look, maybe I made
an impulsive decision.

652
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:59,424
Well, I guess
I'd better be heading out.

653
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,426
Chuck...

654
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,284
thanks for risking your life for me.

655
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:04,549
Don't ever do it again.

656
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:05,638
Don't worry.

657
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:06,723
I won't.

658
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:14,121
Right, I'll give you two
a couple minutes.

659
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:20,146
We have to talk about Chuck.

660
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:25,325
If you know who Chuck really is,
then you pose a security threat.

661
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,215
Someone that I will have to handle.

662
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:29,632
Well, I can't say being
handled by you is...

663
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,456
an unappealing option.

664
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:35,015
Understood.

665
00:37:35,981 --> 00:37:36,803
Look,...

666
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:40,257
if I've proved anything to you by now,
it's that I can keep my word.

667
00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:44,606
Feel free to say "no," but...

668
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,731
your government
has sent a fully-loaded G4

669
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:48,567
to fly me back to London.

670
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:52,019
I figured same amount of fuel,
we'd go to Fiji.

671
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:56,492
- Sorry. Need to work.
- Well, understood.

672
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:59,234
I'm offering to help you
with your interrogation skills.

673
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,654
- Do these lines actually work?
- Often.

674
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,086
Okay.

675
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:07,910
Change of tactic.
The truth.

676
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:12,247
I really need a vacation,
and it looks like you do, too.

677
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:16,585
All I can offer you is some
good company, warm sun,

678
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,676
and lots of wild passion
because the truth is

679
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:22,317
I think you're a breathtakingly
beautiful woman.

680
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:37,298
You spend so much time
worrying about someone else,

681
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,130
you've forgotten about yourself.

682
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,067
I've got work to do.

683
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:06,461
- See you around.
- Good-bye.

684
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,482
Hey, Chuck, I was thinking

685
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,693
that, uh, you know,
maybe Ellie seeing me

686
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,596
naked was actually
a blessing in disguise.

687
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:25,962
Not for her, it wasn't.

688
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:28,842
I realize I need my own place,
somewhere I can sleep naked.

689
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:31,503
You know, and my
poor, sweet mother isn't

690
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:33,787
constantly being violated
by my boss.

691
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,746
- Yeah, that sounds sensible.
- It actually makes perfect sense.

692
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:38,789
I'm 27 years old and I live
in the same room

693
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:41,047
with the same <i>Tron</i> poster
I've had since I was 12.

694
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,755
I just... I need to make
something happen, you know?

695
00:39:44,492 --> 00:39:45,332
Yeah.

696
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,678
Morgan?

697
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:52,389
Yeah?

698
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:55,531
Let's move in together.

699
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,271
Tell me you're not joking.

700
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,592
Let's do it, buddy. I mean, it's time
we both moved on with our lives.

701
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,246
Damn right it is, buddy.

702
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:12,599
I've been waiting so long
to hear you say those words.

703
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:13,889
<i>Bartowski!</i>

704
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,982
How come I got a machine full
of calls from Human Resources?

705
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:18,464
Some kind of harassment?

706
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:21,001
I may have a couple ideas, sir.

707
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:22,419
Get in my office!

708
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:24,877
You think he'll talk?

709
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:26,845
Everyone talks.

710
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:51,693
Guys?

711
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:54,201
Ellie! Awesome!
Can you guys gather around!

712
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:55,827
We've got an announcement to make.

713
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,817
Is it safe?

714
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,626
Yeah, no, cool, man, cool, uh...

715
00:40:58,709 --> 00:40:59,873
Fruit stand's closed.

716
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:01,193
It's okay, babe.

717
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,127
Sorry, it's still a little fresh.

718
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,299
It'll wear off.

719
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,291
Hey, uh, you want to do the honors?

720
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,634
Ellie, Awesome, I have made a very

721
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,886
important decision: I'm moving out.

722
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:14,927
Yes!

723
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,531
- And moving in with Morgan.
- No!

724
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,490
Oh, yeah,...

725
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:22,191
video games and nudity
all day and all night.

726
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:23,500
????

727
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:25,053
What's up?

728
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:26,177
Oh, I'm sorry.

729
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,982
Can I talk to you for a second?
It's kind of important.

730
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,151
Take your time.

731
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:33,185
Okay.

732
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,828
Talk about your third wheel.

733
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,768
Cole's been captured,
by FULCRUM, we believe.

734
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,127
Oh, my God.

735
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:47,133
That's terrible.
I'm sorry.

736
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:49,323
Chuck, he's knows
you're the Intersect.

737
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,049
We have to go into 24-hour
protective detail until further notice.

738
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,270
What exactly does that mean?

739
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:58,824
It means we can't break up,
and we have to move in together.

740
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:09,161
Well, Ellie's watching.
We better sell it.

741
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,519
Are you sure about this?

742
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,120
I mean, he's a really tough guy.
Maybe he won't talk.

743
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:22,114
Chuck,...

744
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:23,582
everyone talks.
