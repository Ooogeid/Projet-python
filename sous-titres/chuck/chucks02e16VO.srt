1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:02,548
<i>Here's a few things
that you might need to know.</i>

2
00:00:02,673 --> 00:00:05,338
<i>I'm not a FULCRUM agent.</i>
I'm MI6 working undercover.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,090
<i>I want to apologize
to you directly, Agent Barker.</i>

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,759
<i>We had no record you were MI6.</i>

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,136
Locked up in this dungeon's
like keeping a

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,579
<i>Botticelli in the basement.</i>

7
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>No one can appreciate</i> <i>the beauty.</i>

8
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,112
- I'm moving out.
- Yes!

9
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:18,759
- And moving in with Morgan.
- No!

10
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:19,954
I'm the Intersect.

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,437
No, he's not.
It's me.

12
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,899
If you know who Chuck really is,
then you pose a security threat.

13
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,795
If I proved anything to you by now,

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,278
<i>it's that I can keep my word.</i>
<i>- Cole's been captured.</i>

15
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,447
You have to go into
24-hour protective detail.

16
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,975
- What exactly does that mean?
- We have to move in together.

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,956
He's a really tough guy.
Maybe he won't talk.

18
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:37,768
Everyone talks.

19
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,546
What's your real name?

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,881
Bond...

21
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,797
James Bond.

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,096
How much does the CIA
know about Perseus?

23
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,686
Oh, come on, not the face.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,340
I'm only going to ask you
one more question.

25
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,299
You answer it, and we're done.

26
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:12,955
Who is the Intersect?

27
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:37,111
Morning, Chuck.

28
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:39,260
How'd you sleep?

29
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,110
Fine, thank you.

30
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:46,807
Busy day.

31
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:48,834
Lots to do.

32
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,917
Uh, so, shower.
Do you want to go first or...?

33
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,121
I'm good.

34
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,783
You know, I know this whole 24-hour

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,412
supervision thing
isn't exactly great but

36
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,516
when the CIA finds us
a new apartment,

37
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:04,364
at least we'll have separate rooms.

38
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:05,599
Sounds great.

39
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:07,385
I mean, consider yourself lucky.

40
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,915
At least you didn't have
to move in with Casey, right?

41
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,717
Lucky me.

42
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,643
- Spearmint okay?
- Yeah, fine.

43
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,521
Traditionally, I'm a peppermint man,
but I'm living on the edge.

44
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,296
Sarah, can I ask you a question?

45
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,006
About the toothpaste?

46
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:43,788
Are you, you worried about Cole?

47
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,318
Of course I'm concerned about Cole.

48
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,970
But Agent Barker can
certainly take care of himself.

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,725
Yeah, I get that.

50
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:59,512
It's just, you know,
you guys had this connection.

51
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,256
He saved your life and
you shared a bit of torture.

52
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,826
Our connection
was purely professional.

53
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,159
That's it.

54
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,854
Thanks, honey.

55
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:14,360
Hi! Good morning!

56
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:20,699
Sorry, sorry. I'm just, I'm very excited
for Chuck, for the both of you

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,451
to be moving in together.

58
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,379
- It's still happening, yeah?
- Absolutely.

59
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,064
Did you find a place yet?

60
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,333
Not that I'm trying
to rush you or anything.

61
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,126
Take your time, bro.
No pressure.

62
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,159
You two lovebirds
need to find a nest

63
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:35,097
where you can let
the worm wiggle free.

64
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:36,742
Thank you, Devon.

65
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,093
Do you need any help packing
or throwing things away?

66
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,195
Sarah, please tell Chuck
that not everything in that room

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,864
has to survive the move.

68
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,232
I'm making a list.

69
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:48,243
Making, uh, making a list, are you?

70
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:50,070
And of what, may I ask?

71
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,823
Where should we begin?

72
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:55,150
Maybe the <i>Tron</i> poster that
you've had since you were 12.

73
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,926
Dad gave me that poster,.

74
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,973
I know. He loved that movie.

75
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:07,621
Have you had any luck finding
his address for the wedding?

76
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,815
No, not yet,

77
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,816
but you know,
I'm, I'm working on it still.

78
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,663
How did Morgan take the news

79
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,776
that he wasn't gonna get
you as a new roommate?

80
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,948
I didn't tell him yet.

81
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,860
I don't have the heart.

82
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,338
Morgan Grimes is so tired
of listening to Big Mike punch

83
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:29,939
his mama's time clock
that he actually showed up

84
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,649
for work on time today.

85
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,234
Morgan Grimes is so disturbed by
what Big Mike is doing to his mama

86
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,638
that the thought of Jeff
doing the same thing to Anna

87
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,280
is actually sweet relief.

88
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,374
That's good.
Laugh it up, fuzzballs.

89
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:49,635
That's right, sure.

90
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,415
Guess what.
I just landed the whale,

91
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,800
'cause me and my man Chuck,
we're gonna be roommates.

92
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,509
So have your fun.
Have at it.

93
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:58,638
But don't expect
any housewarming invitations from me.

94
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:01,875
- Don't give me that face.
- Hey, Morgan, we got to talk.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,777
Yeah, you're just the
man I wanted to see.

96
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,908
I found a place. Two bedroom,

97
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,859
one-and-a-quarter bath,
half a fireplace.

98
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:10,350
- About the apartment.
- You and I are roommates.

99
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:13,120
This is great. We're living the dream.
It's what we always talked about.

100
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,726
The thing is...

101
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,454
Bartkowski, my office now!

102
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:19,693
When did you get an office, John?

103
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,230
What's going on?
We moving?

104
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:24,949
No-tell motel time for Chuck.

105
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,268
A secure bunker
in an undisclosed location.

106
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,001
Seriously, what's with the boxes?

107
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,805
Cole Barker was picked up
12 hours ago by FULCRUM.

108
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,987
We spent the entire night
looking for him and failed.

109
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:36,752
Langley thinks when he talks.
They're gonna come here looking for you.

110
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,577
We're taking you off the grid.

111
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:40,497
What about my sister?
Is she in danger?

112
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:42,835
- Awesome, Morgan?
- First priority is to get you safe.

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,817
Then I'm gonna come back
and make sure everybody else is okay.

114
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,522
If we get that far.

115
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,810
This 240-27.
We have a perimeter breach.

116
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,230
This is it. I'm gonna die
underneath a yogurt shop.

117
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,731
Back door now.

118
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,108
Move, move, move.

119
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,007
Sarah, we need to talk.
If I knew this was gonna happen...

120
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:03,237
Later.

121
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:07,530
Chuck, get back!

122
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:15,809
Cole?

123
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:19,071
Take this.

124
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,298
Did you miss me?

125
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:27,636
Don't worry.
I didn't say a word.

126
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,347
Look at that.

127
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,596
Maybe you're not going
away after all.

128
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,425
Lucky you.

129
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,312
Yeah.

130
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:40,399
Lucky me.

{\pos(192,210)}Oh, come one.

We had a "no gift" policy.

155

{\pos(192,210)}I didn't get you anything.

person at keeping secrets.

157

{\pos(192,210)}I already know what you got me.

158
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,981
You left the lease
for our new apartment

159
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,836
in the fax machine.

160
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,009
A life together
is the best present ever!

161
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:31,112
And when we move in,
I'm gonna show you your mother

162
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:34,122
isn't the only one
who can be noisy in the bedroom.

163
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,557
I gotta go call my parents.

00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,525

166
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,664

{\pos(192,210)}- Oh, my god!
- Oh, buddy, you are screwed.

00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:52,342

to pick up the pieces.

171
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:57,776
{\pos(192,210)}What?

172
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,561
{\pos(192,180)}All you have to do is convince Anna

173
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,792
{\pos(192,210)}that moving in
with you is a bad idea.

174
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,492
{\pos(192,210)}Okay, but how am I gonna...?

175
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,589
You've come to the right place.

176
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:11,751
Repulsion is our business.

177
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,557
And business is good.

178
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,099
<i>Thanks to information provided
by Mr. Barker,</i>

179
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,059
<i>we now know that FULCRUM
is protecting a man</i>

180
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,370
<i>that goes by the code name
"Perseus."</i>

181
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,336
Perseus is the head scientist

182
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,664
behind FULCRUM's effort
to build their own Intersect.

183
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,194
Anything, Chuck?

184
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,613
I spent the past year
undercover trying to get close to him,

185
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,489
but only the inner circle is
ever allowed contact with the man.

186
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:38,501
<i>Intel tells us Perseus
is attending a formal event</i>

187
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:40,330
<i>tonight at the Swiss
Consul's office.</i>

188
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,874
<i>The State Department has arranged
invitations for the two of you.</i>

189
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,250
The two of who?

190
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,877
<i>Agent Walker and Agent Casey.</i>

191
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,422
Are you sure, General?

192
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,337
I'd be happy to accompany
Agent Walker.

193
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:54,884
I bet you would.
I'd be happy to go, too.

194
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,331
Oh, aren't you popular?

195
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,683
I mean, you know, I am, I am
the Intersect and everything.

196
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:01,641
Neither Agent Barker nor Bartkowski
will be going on this mission.

197
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,339
FULCRUM is still actively
searching for the two of you.

198
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,475
Both of you will stay in CASTLE
and monitor by remote feed.

199
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,577
If you recognize anyone,
you'll have radio.

200
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:12,319
Well, at least
no one's telling us to...

201
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,769
You heard the General.
You stay in the bunker.

202
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,113
And there it is.

203
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,152
<i>Phase one</i> <i>of operation repulsion:</i>

204
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:20,042
<i>the obscure</i> <i>and disturbing hobby.</i>

205
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,336
Take that, you chauvinist pig.

206
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,088
Told you not mess with Billie Jean.

207
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,590
- You bitch.
- I'm done for the day.

208
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,058
You want to take me over,

209
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:36,510
show me the new apartment?

210
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,871
You know what, I'd love to, hon,
but we're in the middle of recreating

211
00:10:39,996 --> 00:10:42,290
some of the best tennis matches
ever played, and I'm up next.

212
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:44,312
McEnroe, Stockholm, '84.

213
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,946
- You can't be serious.
- Yes!

214
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,649
Look on the bright side. When we move
in together, you can play, too.

215
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,541
It will be like a nonstop
Wimbledon final in our living room.

216
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,557
Doubles anyone?

217
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,133
That's, that's, that's 95% alcohol.

218
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,725
Don't touch me with that.

219
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,817
Video check.
Do we have a signal?

220
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:25,475
Yep, we got you.
And you look fantastic.

221
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,269
Sarah, is that dress CIA issue,

222
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,290
or do you just make
everything look that good?

223
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,441
Let's stay focused here, people.
We are on a mission.

224
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,721
You do look gorgeous, Sarah.

225
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:38,900
- This is Chuck speaking by the way.
- Too many cooks in the kitchen.

226
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,069
Chuck, you get in Casey's ear,
I'll get in Sarah's.

227
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,838
Okay, you two, split up.

228
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,267
Sarah, you've got
an unsecured exit at 2:00.

229
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,005
The guy in the bad suit standing
in front of the Swiss flag is packing.

230
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:59,217
Casey, you got a bogey.

231
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,554
A tray of crab cakes
coming in on your 10:00.

232
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:09,846
I'm just trying to be helpful, okay?
Works up an appetite on missions.

233
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:12,939
Grab that little...???????????*????????

234
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,079
Thanks.

235
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,905
Sarah, the Italian minister
for trade is headed your way.

236
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,730
Now he can get a little handsy.

237
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,992
I'm Paolo Giordano.

238
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,953
I saw you arrive and couldn't help
but admire your beauty.

239
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,082
His wife's name is Isabella
and he has three little bambinos.

240
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,185
Thank you.

241
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,021
How are Isabella and the children?

242
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:35,768
<i>Senorina.</i>

243
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,514
<i>Nicely done.</i>

244
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,885
Not so bad yourself.

245
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,133
Just, uh, just doing our job.

246
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,073
Me and Cole, Cole and me.

247
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,188
<i>Take your victory lap later.</i>

248
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:50,978
Who else haven't we seen?

249
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:54,481
I don't know, look at the people
by that ice goose thing.

250
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,255
Oh, okay, I just flashed.

251
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,294
The shorter balding
gentleman in the sweater

252
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,611
wearing the glasses
that has got to be Perseus.

253
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:11,331
I have a visual.
Moving in.

254
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,167
His name is Howard Busgang.
He's a research scientist

255
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,779
with the Department of Defense.

256
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:17,181
Good job, Chuck.

257
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:22,081
I have a few skills
of my own now, don't I?

258
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,088
So nine guys? Really, you're not
fudging that number?

259
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,714
- Not even a little bit?
- Sounds harder than it is.

260
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,027
Always go for the knee.

261
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,364
You mean like sweep the leg?

262
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,557
Oh, I'm sorry.

263
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,406
Excuse me.
That's him.

264
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,322
You're a little late to the party.

265
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,248
- I just flashed.
- No, not Busgang, him.

266
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,652
He was the guy who was torturing me.
He's Fulcrum.

267
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:52,744
You two have a nice evening.

268
00:13:58,731 --> 00:13:59,796
Where'd they go?

269
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,673
- Where'd they go?
- Where'd they go?!

270
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,095
My guess is that Fulcrum made them,
and they just jammed the signal.

271
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:12,039
Oh, Dr. Busgang.
I don't believe we've meet before.

272
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,686
- How do you do?
- Your friends are in trouble.

273
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,020
We have to call General Beckman.

274
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,983
- So she can tell us what to do next.
- I'll tell you what we do next.

275
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,093
We go to the consulate
and we save them.

276
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:26,141
No, Sarah and Casey specifically
said for us to stay here.

277
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,336
Sometimes things don't
always go according to plan.

278
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:30,671
- You have to improvise.
- Look, you can't just go run off

279
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,972
- and be the hero all the time.
- It's not about wanting to be a hero.

280
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,707
It's about needing to be.

281
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:37,745
Two guns?

282
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,336
Oh, you really are a badass.

283
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,746
No, Chuck, one gun.

284
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,758
The other one...

285
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:44,883
is for you.

286
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,067
Let's go.

287
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,414
So we are gonna need a cover.

288
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:58,688
Normally we stay in the service arena
waiter, busboy, maybe valet.

289
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:00,393
How about we mix it up this time?

290
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,122
- What do you think about dentists?
- Dentists at a consulate party?

291
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:04,553
You got a better idea?

292
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,062
I say we go as spies.

293
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,994
It's a little obvious, but
I guess we can do it your way.

294
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,111
but the data acquisition problem

295
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:16,118
in Minsky's "society-of-mind" theory

296
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:19,103
was addressed in large part
by Singh's "E-M-One" paper

297
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:20,919
back in... 2005.

298
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:22,830
Sounds fascinating.

299
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,576
Yes. More champagne?

300
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:25,553
Please.

301
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:28,718
Radio's still out. Let's grab
this guy and get out of here.

302
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,949
Now, where was I?

303
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:32,108
You were telling me about
all the wonderful work

304
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,087
- you do for the government.
- That sounds fascinating.

305
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:36,925
I'd like to hear about that, too.

306
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,338
- You going to knock him out, too?
- There are civilians everywhere.

307
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:50,396
We have to find another way in.

308
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:56,375
We should have called Beckman,
had her send a team.

309
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,277
And miss out on all this fun?

310
00:15:58,402 --> 00:15:59,983
Come on, get in the game, Chuck,

311
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,960
before Fulcrum takes out your team.

312
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,579
I think they already have.

313
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,624
You can't be serious.

314
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,463
There's got to be
a ground floor option.

315
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,439
This is good.
We're going up here.

316
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,381
- Damn it.
- You're bleeding.

317
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,445
- No, I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

318
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,031
- What are {\you doing}?
- I'm doing this.

319
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,685
Duncan, what's with the guns?

320
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,121
- Who are these people?
- Not your concern, Howard.

321
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,043
We work for the
government, Dr. Busgang.

322
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,324
So do I.
ell them.

323
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:46,523
We work for the CIA.

324
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:49,696
- The men you work or are terrorists.
- We're not terrorists.

325
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,398
We're patriots, Howard.
You're a patriot.

326
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:54,759
It's a group of spies that turned
your back on the country.

327
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:56,473
You couldn't have it more wrong.

328
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,833
Who do you think we are?
We do what needs to be done

329
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,328
to preserve this nation's
rightful place in the world.

330
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:03,609
Someday, you'll thank us.

331
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:06,646
Well, not you... you'll be dead.

332
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,560
I swear I'm just a scientist.

333
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:10,483
They said I was helping the country.

334
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:14,095
Unfortunately, Howard,
that was the wrong thing to say.

335
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,893
Hey, Cole, Cole, hey!
I found them, I found them.

336
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:25,084
The guy who tortured you is inside with
a couple of other big goons with guns.

337
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,288
Okay, give me 20 seconds,

338
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,630
then you go in there,
start taking guys out, okay?

339
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,016
No, wait, wait, wait!
Listen, about the whole

340
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:36,175
about the whole gun thing Casey and
Sarah, they've never really let me

341
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,389
I don't how do I say this?
I've never fired one.

342
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:40,144
Chuck, it's point and click.

343
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,160
You point at the bad guys,
pull the trigger.

344
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:43,979
Yes, I get the whole concept.
Still...

345
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,808
- 20 seconds.
- Wait...

346
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,086
We're dead.
Bartowski's got a gun.

347
00:17:58,123 --> 00:17:59,536
It's a shame, Howard.

348
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,869
Five, six...

349
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,823
You really do have
an incredible mind.

350
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,667
Uh... t-twenty.

351
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,951
Freeze!
Federal Agent!

352
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,633
- I'm hit!
- Man down! Man down!

353
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:30,086
I'll take care of Chuck.
Get the doctor!

354
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:39,451
Sarah!

355
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,881
Sorry about that.

356
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,382
I'm really not normally
this aggressive with women.

357
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,380
Oh, my God.

358
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,090
You've been shot.

359
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,546
I'm fine.

360
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,133
Gu... Hey! Hey! Hey!

361
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:08,521
Hey, guys,

362
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,840
I think, uh... I think I might
need medical attention.

363
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,827
My ankle is seriously...

364
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,910
- Cole took a bullet to save Sarah.
- Wow. Uh...

365
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,807
You okay, buddy?
What happened?

366
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:19,991
Nothing.

367
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,950
Nothing. I'm f... I'm fine.

368
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:26,121
Really. Never mind.

369
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:30,189
What's that, mahogany?

370
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:33,155
You don't look so good.

371
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,281
Can't say the same for you.

372
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:40,796
Be gentle now.
I bruise easy.

373
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,473
Well, then maybe you should consider
taking better care of yourself.

374
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,592
- Aah.
- This might hurt a bit.

375
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,472
You know, I've been poked at

376
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:57,628
by more spook doctors
than I care to remember.

377
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:00,149
It's nice to be looked after
by someone who treats you

378
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:02,664
as more than just a name,
rank and serial number.

379
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,425
I know what you mean.

380
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,680
Okay, now, just relax.

381
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,101
Hold that.

382
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,427
Thanks, doc.

383
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,249
Well, thank you for saving my life.

384
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,759
What was I gonna do,
not see you again?

385
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,100
Hey.

386
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,902
Howdy. How you doing in here?

387
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:34,737
Right. Absolutely.
Yeah, sorry about that.

388
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:37,277
I was just come... coming by to
see if you guys needed anything.

389
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,248
Cole? Soup?

390
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,029
A bisque of some kind?
Or an <i>US Weekly?</i>

391
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,742
I don't read it myself, but I hear
that when you're sick or injured...

392
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,908
Walker! Barker!

393
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:45,866
Bartowski.

394
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:47,981
Briefing in five.

395
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:50,314
Also that briefing in five.

396
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,333
That was kind of a business thing.

397
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:53,971
I'll see you in five.

398
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:55,922
It's like four-and-a-half now.

399
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,923
Oh, that's the ankle.
That's the ankle.

400
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,624
<i>What are you reading there, sweetie?</i>

401
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,845
Did you know IKEA sells
17 kinds of home shelving?

402
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,996
I can only pronounce
two of them, though.

403
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:08,991
Isn't it silly?

404
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:11,046
Listen. You know what?

405
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:14,498
I wanted to apologize about last night
and the whole Wimbledon thing.

406
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,880
I guess I was just trying
to set some boundaries

407
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:19,181
before we move in,
and I realize there is a

408
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:21,197
more mature way to handle this.
You know?

409
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,820
So, uh, well, there you go.

410
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,274
- A Morgan nuptial?
- Right.

411
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,513
I had Lester's cousin
draw it up for us.

412
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:31,083
A little something
to ensure that there are no

413
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,010
cohabitating conflicts.

414
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,202
No pets?
What about Chico?

415
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:37,209
Oh, that's right. Chico.

416
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:39,196
I guess you have to
put him down now, huh?

417
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:42,258
The only cheese allowed
in the house is string.

418
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:44,811
Or gouda.
On weekends.

419
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,417
Are you insane?

420
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:49,739
Just a teensy-weensy bit particular.

421
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:51,114
And listen to me.

422
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,543
I would totally understand if
you're having second thoughts.

423
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:56,315
Are you kidding me?
Morgan, you're hilarious.

424
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:59,686
I'll sign whatever you want.
Maybe it makes me nuts, too, but

425
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:00,908
I love you,

426
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:02,811
ridiculous quirks and all.

427
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,093
I should have that framed.

428
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:06,308
Totally.

429
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:11,531
Damn it. I should have went
with provolone.

430
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:15,008
Mr. Barker, I understand you were
hurt protecting Agent Walker.

431
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,834
I am told you showed great courage.

432
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,376
Just doing my job, General.

433
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:21,105
Actually, it was Chuck who showed
great courage on this mission.

434
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,350
He was also injured
in the line of duty.

435
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,176
He got clipped by a window sill.

436
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,022
It's as pathetic as it sounds.

437
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,916
Is there any new intel on Busgang
or his FULCRUM handler, General?

438
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,454
We now know that the man
Chuck identified last night,

439
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,401
Dr. Howard Busgang, is in fact
codenamed Perseus.

440
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:38,458
He is a former DARPA scientist
who worked on the original Intersect.

441
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,317
Uh, why was that information
not in my flash?

442
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,997
As a safety precaution,
anything about the creators

443
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:46,006
of the Intersect
was redacted from our files.

444
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,758
I'm sorry. Did you just say
this guy created the Intersect?

445
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:51,619
He was part of the team that developed
its underlying architecture.

446
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,109
He knows as much
about how it works as anyone.

447
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,599
That means he might know
how to get it out of my head.

448
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,140
We don't know, Chuck.

449
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:01,505
But it's possible?

450
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:03,708
Perhaps.

451
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,571
We got to find him. We got
to find this guy before FULCRUM does.

452
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:13,060
We are putting every available
resource on it, Chuck.

453
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,347
Agents Walker and Casey,
prepare for a video link.

454
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:18,021
You're going to brief our field
agents, bring them up to speed.

455
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,884
- Good luck.
- Roger that.

456
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:22,857
Oh, let me...

457
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,673
Hey, what are you looking at there?

458
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:35,830
Oh, just, you know,
footage from the consulate.

459
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,012
Maybe there's something I missed.

460
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,159
You did great tonight, Chuck.

461
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:42,182
Thanks.

462
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,374
You were your usual superhuman self.

463
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:48,459
You saved Sarah's life.

464
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:49,604
No.

465
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:52,981
It was a team effort.

466
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:55,409
I get what she sees in you,
you know.

467
00:23:55,571 --> 00:23:58,941
The fearlessness in the face of
danger, the imperviousness to pain.

468
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:00,531
Super-cool tank tops.

469
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,539
Stop me whenever this is
getting uncomfortable.

470
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:03,566
No.

471
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,286
- The briefing is about to start.
- Great. I'll be right there.

472
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,499
On my way.

473
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:11,239
Oh, you meant him.

474
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,389
Of course you meant him.
What?

475
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,712
Right.

476
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:24,492
My God, could she really be...

477
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,047
Un-repulseable?

478
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:28,797
I'm beginning to think so.

479
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:29,883
No, sir.

480
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:31,377
Not on my watch.

481
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:33,236
What are you suggesting?

482
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:36,224
You're going to need a quart of
peanut oil, some bubble-wrap,

483
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,719
and as much yarn as you can find.

484
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:39,769
Hey, guys.

485
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,424
Hey, Morgan, we need to talk.

486
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,020
Yeah. Hey, what's going on?
And what's with the limp?

487
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:46,074
Nothing. No, I twisted my ankle.

488
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:47,438
Yeah. Jogging.

489
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:49,527
Which I do, occasionally. I'm fine.

490
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:51,735
- We need to talk about...
- About the Anna situation?

491
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,809
Not a problem, Charles.
We are on it.

492
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:56,762
You are looking at three individuals
gifted in the art of repulsion.

493
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:58,729
Anna doesn't stand a chance.

494
00:24:58,943 --> 00:25:00,552
Why are you trying to repulse Anna?

495
00:25:00,677 --> 00:25:02,594
No, no, no. Lester,
that's ridiculous.

496
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:05,345
What I was trying to do
was simply test her. That's all.

497
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,972
Testing her, why?

498
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:10,481
Because, Chuck, because she's
trying to get all serious

499
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:13,136
with me, and I want to make sure

500
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,120
that she loves me for me and not...

501
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,890
- Other things.
- Excuse us.

502
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:20,614
Are you crazy?

503
00:25:21,224 --> 00:25:24,666
What other things could she
possibly be loving you for?

504
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,024
I mean, honestly, buddy.

505
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,144
You know that I love you,
but-but you're lucky

506
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:31,773
to have a girl in your life
who loves you for you,

507
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,640
even though you are, in fact...

508
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:35,663
you.

509
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:38,786
Fair.

510
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,651
I you don't stop testing her,

511
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:43,012
she's going to choose to
be with someone else.

512
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:45,782
And then you will have realized,
and unfortunately, too late,

513
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:48,174
that you lost the
catch of a lifetime.

514
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:54,471
Counterpoint: she's not
the catch of a lifetime.

515
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,596
She's a scheming tart
who will harvest your organs

516
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,625
and sell them to the highest bidder.

517
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:02,532
Chuck's right.

518
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:04,584
Lester wrong.

519
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:10,662
Chuck.

520
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:13,255
- What happened?
- Nothing. It's a flesh wound.

521
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,109
- It's nothing. I'm fine.
- Well, let's see. Sit down.

522
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,034
Up, up.

523
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,373
Sorry, sorry.
Devon, can you help?

524
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:22,519
Please promise not to go
all crazy Dr. Sister on me.

525
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:23,718
What's up, babe?

526
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:25,455
We need to get Chuck
to the hospital.

527
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,085
- We got to X-ray this leg.
- No, we don't. I'm fine.?*?

528
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:30,712
- Pretty swollen there.
- I'm actually a lot tougher

529
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:32,806
- than people think I am.
- I know you are, buddy.

530
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:35,227
Sometimes it takes a real man
to admit when you're hurt.

531
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:36,171
Ouch.

532
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:38,683
That actually hurt.

533
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,601
I didn't think anything hurt you.

534
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,484
Oh, no, there are some things.

535
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:45,391
The clinical disinterest
of a beautiful woman,

536
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:46,854
for instance.

537
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:52,011
- Any word on Busgang?
- Not yet.

538
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:54,407
Casey and I are headed
to the airport.

539
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:56,982
They think Busgang might
try to leave the country.

540
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:00,888
All right, then.

541
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:02,613
Rest up.

542
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:06,844
Wait.

543
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:07,870
Listen.

544
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:10,635
You know, I meant
what I said earlier

545
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,310
about being around people
who really care about you

546
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:15,466
and who you really care about.

547
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:19,022
It doesn't happen often
for people like us.

548
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,828
No. It doesn't.

549
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,144
What if we're lucky enough
to find that person?

550
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,481
We're supposed to just walk away?

551
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:33,943
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

552
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,413
No.

553
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:42,261
Because it isn't.

554
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,430
Is the cast absolutely necessary?

555
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:53,431
Yes.
It could be a hairline fracture.

556
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:54,959
Better safe than sorry.

557
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:56,980
I'm going to go
find you some crutches.

558
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:59,915
No, absolutely not. I want
to be released immediately.

559
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,032
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a gunshot wound.

560
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:04,467
- We have to report this.
- This is outrageous.

561
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:05,978
I don't care about your rules.

562
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,255
I don't care about what you have to do.
I'm leaving now.

563
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,420
Sir, I highly suggest you stay overnight
in case your leg gets infected.

564
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:12,520
I can't do that.

565
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:13,941
I have to go.

566
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:17,036
Yeah.

567
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:19,283
Casey, it's Chuck.
Look, I found Busgang.

568
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,308
He's here at the hospital.
Westside Medical.

569
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,993
You found him. Great work. All right.
We'll have a strike team there

570
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,868
- in a half an hour.
- No. He's leaving.

571
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:27,925
Don't follow him, Chuck.
It's too dangerous.

572
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,713
He might know how to get the Intersect
out of my head. I can't let him go.

573
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:32,804
Listen to me. Do not
go after him on your own.

574
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:34,526
Do not be a hero here, Chuck.

575
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,737
Look, I don't want to be a hero,

576
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:39,105
but sometimes, you need to be.

577
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,868
Besides, this is doable.

578
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,649
I've got them both.

579
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:26,727
Hi. Hi.

580
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,482
- I'm looking for Mr. Busgang.
- Do you have an appointment?

581
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,541
No. Yeah, well.
Uh, the thing is, see,

582
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,103
I'm a computer tech.

583
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:36,298
Um, Nerd Herd.
That's me.

584
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:39,792
And apparently, Mr. Busgang has
some major hardware problems.

585
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,746
Constellation Science, second floor.

586
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:42,743
Thank you.

587
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,917
Can I help you gentlemen?

588
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:57,956
Turn around.

589
00:30:58,548 --> 00:30:59,477
Slowly.

590
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:05,457
- You're the guy who shot me.
- It was an accident, I swear.

591
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:07,582
It was the first time
I had ever handled a gun and

592
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:10,121
the first time that I had shot someone.
Clearly those two things

593
00:31:10,246 --> 00:31:12,119
must be connected in some way.
Hi. I'm Chuck.

594
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:26,877
Sit down and don't move.

595
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,513
I need to accidentally shoot you.

596
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,684
I didn't come to hurt you
or even take you in.

597
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,165
I just want some answers
about the Intersect.

598
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:38,769
What do you know
about the Intersect?

599
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:41,473
A lot, actually.

600
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:43,164
Who are you?

601
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:56,092
Orion.

602
00:32:00,756 --> 00:32:02,163
Did you just flash?

603
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:07,925
Cover the stairs.

604
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:16,340
You're the one they've been
talking about, aren't you?

605
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:19,937
I didn't believe it could be true.

606
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:22,668
A human Intersect.

607
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:26,378
Extraordinary.

608
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:27,731
Maybe for you.

609
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,703
But you have to understand,
for me...

610
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:33,089
for me, it's a nightmare.

611
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:35,707
Living with this thing in my head

612
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:37,317
is ruining my life.

613
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:44,081
Is there any way th-that Intersect
images can be taken out?

614
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:46,643
You know, can a person
be "de-Intersected"?

615
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:48,659
Can it be removed?

616
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:50,414
Possibly.

617
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:53,061
I don't know.

618
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,184
Only Orion would know.

619
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,832
Orion? Who is Orion?

620
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:59,292
It was his idea, his vision.

621
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,302
Everything is based on his work.

622
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:04,276
He put the team together,
he drove the research,

623
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,185
- until he realized...
- Put the gun down, Howard.

624
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,909
Who's Orion?
Where can I find him?

625
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,528
Please! I need to know!

626
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:13,782
Split up!

627
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:17,694
I haven't told him anything.

628
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:18,834
No! No!

629
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,739
- That's the second time you've shot me.
- Let's hope the third time's the charm.

630
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:34,386
Sweep the leg.

631
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:44,499
Hey, are you okay?

632
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:45,898
I'm fine. The gun.
- What?

633
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,633
Chuck, the gun!

634
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:48,844
Oh, help!

635
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,409
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so! I think so.

636
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,871
Oh, you were,
you were talking to him.

637
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:03,415
I thought you were asking if I was
okay but you're talking to him

638
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,531
because he's been shot again, right.
My bad.

639
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:07,262
No, I was talking to both of you.

640
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:09,009
We're okay, right?
We're okay.

641
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:10,941
Yeah... right.

642
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:15,110
Absolutely, we're okay.

643
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:17,717
Excellent work, team.

644
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:20,263
While we would have preferred
to take Busgang alive,

645
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:22,534
by capturing his work
we've significantly set back

646
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,643
Fulcrum's ability to build
their own Intersect.

647
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:27,007
Uh, what about that name? Orion?

648
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,923
Busgang said that Orion could maybe
get the Intersect out of my head.

649
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:33,692
As of now, we have no leads,
but our best people are on it.

650
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:35,837
Agent Barker,
medical transport for you

651
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:37,587
back to the U.K.
has been arranged.

652
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:39,030
Thank you, General.

653
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:42,663
So, it seems my work
here is done... again.

654
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:44,832
Agent Casey,

655
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,771
it's been a real pleasure
working with you.

656
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:48,972
Yeah, likewise.
Can I ask you something?

657
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:51,934
When you escaped from Fulcrum,
you really take out nine guys?

658
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:53,016
The truth?

659
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:54,554
Professional courtesy.

660
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,678
It was more like 12.
I just don't like to boast.

661
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:05,527
So, what's next?

662
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:08,316
Wing back to London
and jam with The Stones?

663
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,608
I have to say, Chuck,
you are truly the most

664
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:14,094
special agent I've ever worked with.

665
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:15,988
Special.

666
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:19,487
Good luck with getting
that thing out of your head.

667
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:21,994
Thanks, but, uh, I'm
beginning to think

668
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,780
that's never going to happen.

669
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:25,970
You know what?

670
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,234
I got a not-so-secret
secret for you.

671
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,389
You want something bad enough,

672
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:33,825
don't ever take no for an answer.

673
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,674
And...

674
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,850
for God sakes, man,
carry a gun. Maybe two.

675
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:56,960
Nice cast.

676
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:58,399
Ellie go to work on you?

677
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:01,219
Yeah, yeah. I'm just happy
it's not full body.

678
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:04,793
Morgan, we gotta talk about
the whole moving-in thing.

679
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:05,955
I know we do.

680
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,721
Chuck, I just don't know
how to say this. I...

681
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:11,149
You should have a seat.

682
00:36:11,274 --> 00:36:12,211
Okay.

683
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:17,513
Sometimes things happen between,

684
00:36:17,638 --> 00:36:20,951
uh, two people who care
about each other very much.

685
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:26,266
And it doesn't mean that
they don't belong together.

686
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,772
Belong together?
What are you talking about?

687
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,868
Uh, no, no, no.

688
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,589
I can't move in with you, Chuck, because
I'm going to move in with Anna.

689
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,857
She loves me and she wants
to move in with me.

690
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:40,490
And I want to make her happy.

691
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,071
- But I want you to understand.
- I do, buddy.

692
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:46,034
Seriously, I totally
understand and furthermore,

693
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,257
I think that you are absolutely
making the right decision.

694
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:51,041
Whew, that's awesome.
Thank you.

695
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,415
She gonna be okay with
your string cheese habit?

696
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,422
I know she will be, bro.

697
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,037
Hey, and, uh, you and I,

698
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:00,171
you know, we'll still be...

699
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:02,528
friends?

700
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:04,529
As opposed to what?

701
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:06,118
That's an excellent point.

702
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:08,356
Okay.

703
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:14,988
Dr. Walker,

704
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,965
my superiors agree
that I need 24-hour

705
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,391
round- the-clock medical assistance.

706
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:24,096
Our jet awaits.

707
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:27,363
I'm sorry, I have yogurt to serve.

708
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:29,645
You'll have to find somebody
else to take care of you.

709
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,245
Now, now, you see, that's
not going to work because

710
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,986
no one else is gonna
make me feel like you do.

711
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:36,211
Believe me,...

712
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,913
I've looked.

713
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:40,944
I'm serious.

714
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,406
Don't pack your bags,
don't say good-byes,

715
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,664
just close your eyes and say yes.

716
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:48,030
Come with me, Sarah.

717
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:51,726
I'm sorry.

718
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:57,009
What's the matter?

719
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:59,426
I thought you were a girl
who liked adventure.

720
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:03,885
I guess I'm not the kind of girl
who cheats on her cover boyfriend.

721
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,699
Is that all he is?
A cover?

722
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:07,567
What do you mean?

723
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,441
I saw the way you looked at him
when his life was in danger.

724
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:14,412
I've been doing this
a long time, Agent Walker.

725
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:22,319
Well, who'd have thought it.

726
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:26,333
Cole Barker loses the girl
to Chuck Bartowski.

727
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:31,079
When you meet somebody
you care about,

728
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,184
it's just hard to walk away.

729
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,431
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

730
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,561
- How's your foot?
- Uh, throbbing.

731
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:18,019
Thanks.

732
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,109
- Did Cole leave?
- Uh, mm-hmm.

733
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,789
He's quite a guy.

734
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:26,833
Uh, yeah.

735
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,532
That he is.

736
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,603
You know, I understand
what you see in him.

737
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:34,409
He's a great spy.

738
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:36,790
Top of good guys.

739
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,408
The truth is, you two
would make a great team.

740
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:40,335
Chuck...

741
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,729
Please, let me just finish.

742
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:52,179
Sarah, I'm not gonna
move in with you.

743
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:56,803
Because I can't.

744
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,782
And you know why I can't.

745
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,376
I'm crazy about you,
and I've always been.

746
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,200
But you know, having a fake
relationship, that's one thing.

747
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:08,938
But living together is...

748
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:14,599
I mean, every day being
around each other and-and...

749
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:19,416
And that's why I can't do it.

750
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:23,070
And I hope you understand.

751
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:24,560
I do.

752
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:27,654
Thank you.

753
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:35,640
Oh, and, uh, just so you know,

754
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:40,723
I am going to get this thing
out of my head one day.

755
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:41,773
I will.

756
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:43,980
And when I do, I'm going to live

757
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:46,709
the life that I want
with the girl that I love.

758
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:50,321
Because I'm not going to let
this thing rob me of that. I won't.

759
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,648
Hey, how's the ankle?

760
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:07,747
I picked up some boxes in case you
wanted to start packing up your room.

761
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:10,591
Change of plans,
not moving out, talk later.
