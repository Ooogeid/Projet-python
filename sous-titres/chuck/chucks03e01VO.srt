1
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,167
No one stops us.

2
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:11,869
No one ever has.

3
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:16,973
Chuck, did you just flash?

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,814
Oh, Chuck me.

5
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:19,726
Kill him.

6
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:20,800
Hyah!

7
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:31,614
Chuck?

8
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:34,495
Guys...

9
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:37,169
I know kung fu.

10
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,591
: Agent Carmichael.

11
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:54,732
Call me "Charles."

12
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,405
You have something

13
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,276
that belongs to my boss, Yuri: the case.

14
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:00,215
I would like for you to give it to me.

15
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,925
Please?

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,974
You show up with no gun and "Please?"

17
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,859
What, I quiver in fear?

18
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:12,462
Chuck, we've got a lock on the case.

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,164
It's there in the room with you.

20
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:22,645
Give me the case...

21
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,482
or else.

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,487
Or else what?

23
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:29,092
Or else I do this?

24
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:41,377
No, I was thinking something more like this.

25
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,578
Ha! Cool, cool, cool! Everybody be cool!

26
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:47,142
Everybody just chill out!

27
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,245
Very, very good. On the ground now.

28
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,483
Nice and easy.

29
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,852
Now, Yuri, hand me that case,

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,355
and then after that, it's pirogi time.

31
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:55,791
Ooh.

32
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:57,026
Shoot him, Chuck.

33
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:01,034
Do it.

34
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,503
Shoot me.

35
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:04,506
Don't mess with me, Yuri.

36
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,609
Shoot him now!

37
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:06,877
Get him!

38
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:33,204
Chuck, what is happening?
Your heart rate just spiked.

39
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:35,472
Are you okay? I'm okay.
I got punched in the face.

40
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,708
It's throbbing a little bit.

41
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,844
Get out of there now!

42
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,114
Where's my exit?

43
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:44,415
They're closing in on you.

44
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:45,615
Get to a roof.

45
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,679
Chopper's...

46
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,850
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

47
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,652
Listen, General, I don't
want to sound demanding here,

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,654
but I could really use that
chopper right about now!

49
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:55,889
The chopper's too far out.

50
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,624
Satellite says there's a
power line on the roof

51
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:58,859
that runs to the next building.

52
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,595
Zip line across,
we'll find you a new exit...

53
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,130
What do you mean, zip line?

54
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:04,232
It's in the Intersect.

55
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,101
Okay, I got this.

56
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:16,514
Oh. Oh.

57
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:17,949
Oh, God. Oh, God.

58
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:19,550
General, I don't think this is

59
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,386
a good idea. I'm not flashing. Do it, Chuck!

60
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,821
Flash!

61
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,790
Look, if you stress me out,
it's never going to work.

62
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:26,526
Chuck, flash! Okay.

63
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:28,595
Okay.

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,231
Flash.

65
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,467
One, two, three, flash.

66
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,203
I don't think my vertigo is helping here.

67
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:38,239
General, are you there?

68
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,474
General?!

69
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,409
You're dead.

70
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:51,221
That's all, Frank.

71
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:52,889
Terminate the simulation.

72
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:54,491
: Copy that, ma'am.

73
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,363
Chuck?

74
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:02,733
You can come down now.

75
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,773
<i>Why didn't you shoot Yuri, Chuck?</i>

76
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,142
Well, we were very close,
and while I realize

77
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,178
it's just a simulation,
safety first, you know?

78
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,414
And to be perfectly honest,
I'm still not comfortable

79
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:16,915
with the whole shooting people thing.

80
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,183
This isn't working out.

81
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,184
Look, General, I realize
that we've had our setbacks,

82
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:23,185
I-I-I do, but let's not
dwell in the past here.

83
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,954
I'm convinced I can be
a great spy. I know it.

84
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:27,321
We've spent millions of dollars

85
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,823
to get you up and running
as our new Intersect agent.

86
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,990
It's not working.

87
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:32,358
Well, maybe my dad can help.

88
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:33,526
He built the computer.

89
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:35,261
The problem is not with the computer.

90
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:36,728
It's with you.

91
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:40,131
The Intersect 2.0 was designed
to go into a real spy,

92
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,499
like Bryce Larkin,

93
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,500
someone in complete
control of their feelings.

94
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,135
What are you saying?

95
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,970
It's over.

96
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,039
Our Los Angeles field unit
will keep an eye on you

97
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:52,540
until a final decision can be
made regarding your status.

98
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,108
Wait, hold on just-just a second here.

99
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,476
Are you saying you're firing me, General?

100
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:57,878
Do you... You have any idea
what I gave up for this?

101
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:58,945
Good-bye, Chuck. No.

102
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:00,213
You don't know what I said no to!

103
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,414
Frank. Oh.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,058
<i>Go home, tell your sister you went on</i>

105
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,027
<i>a last-minute trip to Europe,
six weeks.</i>

106
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,295
<i>Okay. Where are we really going?</i>

107
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,396
<i>To a Red Site</i>

108
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,297
<i>training facility.</i>

109
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,065
Training for what?

110
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,530
For you, moron.

111
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:19,730
The new Intersect.

112
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,131
They're gonna train you to use it,

113
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,531
turn you into a real super-spy.

114
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,133
Sarah, did Casey tell you

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,867
they're moving me to a training facility?

116
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,868
I'm going to be a real spy. I know, I heard.

117
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:29,569
Come on. What...?

118
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,972
What's the matter?

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,473
If you do this, if you go,

120
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,842
you're gonna be a spy for
the rest of your life.

121
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,578
Every city is gonna be a new
mission and a new identity,

122
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,580
and you're not gonna be the same person.

123
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:42,249
Yeah. That's a great thing.

124
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:45,488
Chuck, listen. We could...

125
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:47,423
We could what?

126
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:49,925
We could run?

127
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:52,593
Together. You and me.

128
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,295
We go now, and we never look back.

129
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,930
Are you serious?

130
00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:59,297
I have some money saved up.

131
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,099
I'd have to get us some new identities,

132
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,366
create an escape route.

133
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,434
For now, go to the training
facility in Prague,

134
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,269
then meet me at the Nadrazi train station

135
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:07,571
in three weeks' time at 7:00,

136
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,307
and then I can figure the rest out later.

137
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,410
What are you saying?

138
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:15,846
I'm saying I want to be a real person again.

139
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,582
With you.

140
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,852
This is what you want, right?

141
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,053
I mean, this is it, Chuck.

142
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,322
Will you run away with me?

143
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,133
Yeah.

144
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:44,473
<i>Chuck? Chuck, what happened?</i>

145
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,547
Chuck, honey, where's Sarah?

146
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:51,149
I lost her.

147
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:54,084
The girl of my dreams.

148
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:55,286
It was all my fault.

149
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,586
Well, maybe not.

150
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:58,288
Why don't you just pick
up the phone and call her?

151
00:06:58,356 --> 00:06:59,856
You guys can work it out.

152
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:01,557
I'm sure she misses you, too.

153
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,659
* *

154
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,606
Your phone, my dear.

155
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,046
Pick up, Sarah.

156

Morning, Chuck.

164
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,630
Morning, bro. Mm-hmm.

165
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:34,998
Chuck, you feeling any better?

166
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,166
You got a game plan?

167
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,235
Job hunting? Probably not.

168
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,969
No rush, amigo,

169
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:45,037
but how long you think you'll be staying?

170
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:47,672
* *

171
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,125
Chuck?

172
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:10,628
Chuck, if you won't talk to me,
then you have a visitor.

173
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,330
Chuck!

174
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:15,331
Chuck?

175
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,366
It's-It's me, man.

176
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,335
Morgan. Ow.

177
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:21,836
Morgan?! Yeah?

178
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:24,204
Is that you?

179
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,539
It is. It is. Ah.

180
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,807
I-I'm back for a few days.

181
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,975
Hawaii is great.

182
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,876
And Benihana... Forget about it.

183
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,377
Flying through the ranks.

184
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,613
That's it, man. I'm gonna
be master chef in no time.

185
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,013
I'm so proud of you.

186
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,948
We should get together soon, you know.
You and I sit down and...

187
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,649
Yeah? No. I would love that.
That's exactly what I thought...

188
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,853
Hmm.

189
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,125
Worse than I thought.

190
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:50,227
All right, Chuck, that is enough!

191
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,162
Sit up! You are getting off this couch.

192
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,197
And you are going to do something

193
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,729
today.

194
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,729
Out! Out!

195
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,230
I tried, guys.

196
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,665
Leave him with his cheese balls.

197
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,099
That's all he cares about.

198
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,494
Hello, sir.

199
00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:35,695
How may I service you?

200
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:37,029
n deep voice): Uh...

201
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,464
I'm looking for cheese puffs?

202
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:40,765
Aisle 3.

203
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,400
It's been a pleasure serving you.

204
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:53,075
Look at that wretch.

205
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:56,310
Security, we have a
street person in aisle 3.

206
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,679
Could be the one stealing
toilet paper from the bathroom.

207
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,888
Gotcha. Hand it over, punk.

208
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,492
Bartowski?

209
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:20,696
Oh, Chuck Bartowski?

210
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,168
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

211
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:27,603
Get a good look, everybody.

212
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,005
Everybody, everybody, come hither.

213
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:30,373
Come hither.

214
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,441
Take a sniff.

215
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:38,578
That is the putrid stench of failure.

216
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:40,914
That's why you don't leave the Buy More.

217
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:44,250
Okay. You become feral.

218
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,718
Wretched.

219
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:47,820
You're just another loser.

220
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:53,358
My God, you're pathetic.

221
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:56,894
Sneaking back into the Buy More like some...

222
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,128
vagrant Serpico.

223
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,065
Goodness.

224
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:05,967
You're a hot mess. Emmett, please.

225
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:08,236
I'm sorry. Do you have something to say?

226
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,471
Right here.

227
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:17,611
No, I have nothing to say.
I'm good. I'm okay. I'm good.

228
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,779
Oh, that's what I thought.

229
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:22,648
Well, it's a good thing

230
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,850
because you don't know how close you came

231
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,552
to getting your ass kicked.

232
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:36,291
Oh, Captain, my Captain!

233
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,559
Please tell us that you've returned

234
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:39,195
to take control of the Buy More!

235
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,966
Look, I'm... I'm sorry, fellas.

236
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,001
I'm-I'm sorry, everyone. I don't think

237
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:46,002
I could help even if I tried.
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

238
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,670
What do you care about our troubles?
You still got blondie.

239
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:48,838
Actually, we're not...

240
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:49,872
I think she's getting hotter.

241
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,306
Agreed. Her ass seems

242
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:52,841
to be lifting ever so slightly.

243
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:53,875
Listen, Charles... What?

244
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,043
Ass.

245
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,077
No. What?

246
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:57,144
You've seen her?

247
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:58,612
Just through the lens of a telescope

248
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,014
when she goes in and out
of that nasty yogurt shop.

249
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,717
She's still here?!

250
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,990
Sarah?

251
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,858
Hello?

252
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:29,038
Heard you were a lemon,
but this is pathetic, Bartowski.

253
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,540
Even for you.

254
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:33,408
What the hell are you doing here?

255
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:36,644
I think that I left a light jacket

256
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:38,712
in Castle. I was just here to pick it up.

257
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Clean those up.

258
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,917
Hurry it up. I gotta finish packing.

259
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,319
What's been going on in the biz?

260
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:50,488
You, uh, talk to any of the old gang?

261
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:51,922
Sarah, for instance?

262
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,858
Nope.

263
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,199
Really?

264
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:59,166
Yeah?

265
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,200
Mm-hmm. Can I talk to her

266
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,668
when you're done?

267
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,270
Yeah.

268
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:04,905
7:00. Mm-hmm.

269
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:06,907
Yeah. Just tell her...

270
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:08,375
if you could just ask her

271
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,711
if she's gotten my messages
because I've been calling...

272
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,345
a lot.

273
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:13,746
It's the Lemon.

274
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:17,082
Duly noted. See ya tonight.

275
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,918
Did she say anything about me?

276
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,252
Nope.

277
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:25,352
Hey, you guys going

278
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:26,386
on a mission? You need backup?

279
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:27,420
I can still flash.

280
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,055
Not what I heard.

281
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:32,557
Come on, Casey, please.

282
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,225
Beckman canned me, all right, man.

283
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:36,127
I need to prove to her
that I can still do this.

284
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,129
That I can still be a spy.

285
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:39,730
Can you?

286
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,365
Yes, I can. And this could work, too.

287
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,633
Because if I help you guys,

288
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,935
then maybe Beckman puts the
old team back together.

289
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,769
Hmm.

290
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,704
And all my dreams come true.

291
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,447
What?

292
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:58,648
I'm heading out.

293
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:01,651
Enjoy your spy game thing.

294
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,319
And stay in touch.

295
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,721
Hey.

296
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,956
What happened between you and Walker?

297
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,793
Something I need to fix.

298
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:42,580
* *

299
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:57,092
Um, somebody called about
a computer emergency.

300
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,094
Sound board's down.

301
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:02,163
Cool. Thanks.

302
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,174
Walker, we have a situation.

303
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:41,496
Hello, Chuck.

304
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:42,663
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:44,365
Don't worry. This is not about us.

306
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,332
I'm purely here for backup.

307
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,467
I need to prove to Beckman...

308
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:47,467
Kiss me.

309
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:48,668
What? Right now?

310
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:49,769
Don't you think we should

311
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:50,737
talk first? I'm getting mixed signals.

312
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:53,339
Kiss me now!

313
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,251
Who the hell is that?

314
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,085
Uh... just my ex.

315
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,920
He's having some trouble letting go.

316
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,055
Hmm.

317
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:18,972
Why'd you knock him out?

318
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,440
It was a slap. Mmm.

319
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,475
Lemon's got a glass jaw.

320
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,111
I was caught off guard on
an empty stomach, okay?

321
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,146
I didn't eat anything. I can take a punch.

322
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,280
You mean a slap.

323
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,452
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, guys.

324
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,154
I didn't mean to screw anything up.

325
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,655
I just came here to help out.

326
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,691
Things went wrong in Prague,
I don't know why,

327
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,359
but I know that I can do this.

328
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:42,560
I can be a spy.

329
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:47,430
Sarah, you know I can.

330
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,298
Please.

331
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,234
Get him out of here.

332
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,601
You heard the lady.

333
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:56,635
Get out of here.

334
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,969
Casey, wait, wait, wait.

335
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,136
I can help you. Bartowski,

336
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,570
it's a simple courier exchange.

337
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,804
Gilles, the guy with Walker,

338
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:03,972
he's the mark.

339
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,806
He's meeting with a major
Ring operative tonight.

340
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:07,274
The Ring? They killed Bryce.

341
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:10,010
The moment the Ring courier
meets with Gilles, we strike.

342
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:11,811
Now, get out of here
before you spook Javier.

343
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:12,612
Who?

344
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,013
The courier, Javier Cruz.

345
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:15,681
: Get him out of here.

346
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,150
<i>Javier Cruz.</i>

347
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:24,023
Casey, Javier's not a courier!

348
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,191
Come on, buddy. Let's go. No, guys.

349
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,292
Guys, you have to listen to me.

350
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,460
Javier's not who you think he is!

351
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:28,460
He's an assassin! Trust me!

352
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:29,528
He's here to kill someone.

353
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:33,500
We dumped the Lemon.

354
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:38,904
Let me back in!

355
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:41,573
Let me back in!

356
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,909
Come on.

357
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,244
Come...

358
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:48,812
Okay. Okay.

359
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,813
All right. All right.

360
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,648
Oh, son of a...

361
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,051
That's going to leave a mark.

362
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,720
Okay. Okay.

363
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:56,720
Calm down, Chuck.

364
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:58,789
Don't be emotional.

365
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,493
Excuse me.

366
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,227
<i>Por favor...</i>

367
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh... oh, my God,

368
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:12,859
I'm so sorry.

369
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:14,761
Oh. Oh. I'm so sorry.

370
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,328
My bad. Wake up. Wake up.

371
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:17,563
Oh, God.

372
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,930
Oh, no.

373
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:26,437
* *

374
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:31,675
Where have you been? You're on. What?

375
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:33,176
Let's go! No, no, wait.

376
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:34,510
I have to use the little boys'...

377
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:35,945
the little chicos' room,
little amigos' room.

378
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:46,254
<i>Hola! Â¿Como estas?</i>

379
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:48,422
Ah!

380
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,124
Yeah.

381
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,126
Hey, where's Manny?

382
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,961
Spastic colon.

383
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,028
I'm filling in for him.

384
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,032
He's going to blow the whole op!

385
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,967
Just give him a second.

386
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,837
* Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma *

387
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,238
* Ma ma ma ma ma ma. *

388
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:09,906
<i>Bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno.</i>

389
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,053
Where the hell did he learn that?

390
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:36,129
Isn't that your ex?

391
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:38,097
Yeah, he's a bit of a show-off.

392
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:39,464
Just ignore him.

393
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,166
Assassin.

394
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:44,434
Assassin.

395
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:45,568
Where?

396
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:01,982
Do you want my men

397
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:03,716
to take care of your ex? Uh, no.

398
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:05,517
Come dance with me.

399
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,535
What is he doing here?

400
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:28,036
He's just trying to make you jealous.

401
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,638
And that's supposed to be your job.

402
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,577
Wait.

403
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:38,644
How did he know you were here?

404
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:39,778
Who is he really?

405
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:41,480
Tranq him! Take him out now!

406
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,186
* *

407
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:54,024
You have nothing to worry about.

408
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,875
Sarah!

409
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:16,345
GILLES: What's going on?

410
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,379
Don't move! Don't you move!

411
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:21,816
Chuck, what the hell are you doing?

412
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,584
There's a... There's an assassin here.

413
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:25,052
There's an assassin here, people.

414
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,353
He was gonna kill her.

415
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:27,988
He was gonna kill you. Where?

416
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,489
Where is he?

417
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,191
Half this club is undercover, Chuck.

418
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,893
Been planning this for months.

419
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,761
Good thing we brought this many agents

420
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,029
'cause I'm gonna kill you! No!

421
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:38,464
Casey!

422
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:40,065
Sarah, I flashed.

423
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,232
I swear to you,

424
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,865
there was an assassin here. It was Javier.

425
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,266
Now we'll never know.

426
00:22:45,702 --> 00:22:47,735
You don't work anymore, Chuck. It's over.

427
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,247
Good morning.

428
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,514
Good morning.

429
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,248
Chuck, you shaved.

430
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:06,349
That's great.

431
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:09,018
It was a rash decision.

432
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:11,253
I can't bear to watch him wallow around

433
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:12,788
like this all day. It's pathetic.

434
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,493
What's up, bro? Huh?

435
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,861
Still playing the loser cover?

436
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:23,062
You're nailing it.

437
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,798
Not a cover.

438
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:26,066
It's my life.

439
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:27,868
I was fired for real.

440
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:29,402
I'm not a spy anymore.

441
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,039
And to be perfectly honest,
I'm not sure I ever really was.

442
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,974
Whoa. Wait.

443
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,741
This is really you?

444
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,108
Maybe we should be introduced.

445
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:41,177
Hi. I'm Chuck Bartowski, total loser,

446
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:43,278
cheese ball addict.

447
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:47,214
Does the CIA let you just leave like that?

448
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:49,850
Don't they send someone to,
like, kill you or something?

449
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:53,854
I think you've watched too many movies.

450
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:19,806
Don't kill me!

451
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,876
Duh! Holy, dude.

452
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,045
It's-It's just... It's me.

453
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,646
Ellie thought I should come by and...

454
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,383
Thought I might cheer you up. I...

455
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,551
Yeah, well,

456
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:28,852
thanks, but I wish

457
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,120
everyone would just leave
me alone because I'm fine.

458
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:32,221
No, you're not, dude.

459
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:33,389
Come on.

460
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:35,124
I've known you a long time, pal.

461
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,792
You're slightly unmotivated,

462
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,427
a bit of an underachiever,

463
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:39,794
but a loser?

464
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:41,062
It's not your turf.

465
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,763
What's going on?

466
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,068
I blew it, buddy.

467
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,736
Opportunity of a lifetime.

468
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:51,637
Without getting into specifics,
I had a job offer

469
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:53,305
that would have included a lot of travel

470
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:55,673
and excitement, and I've already
been fired from it twice.

471
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:57,575
Amateur hour.

472
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,843
You haven't even scratched the surface.

473
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:02,013
You want to see rock bottom? Okay.

474
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:04,348
Follow me, sir.

475
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,984
<i>So, I got canned from Benihana</i>

476
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:08,151
a few weeks ago,

477
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,020
and Anna took off with the prep chef.

478
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:11,287
I lost my mojo.

479
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:12,521
Couldn't flip the shrimp.

480
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:14,490
Couldn't flip the shrimp.

481
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,494
Bed,

482
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,928
TV,

483
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:23,264
microwave for meals.

484
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,533
And of course, machine for laundry.

485
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,501
Drink in it, Chuck.

486
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,403
This is as low as a man can get.

487
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,504
Grimes.

488
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,139
So he's been the one stealing the TP.

489
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,608
Well, I should have known

490
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:38,043
he'd never make it in an
Asian business culture.

491
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,045
I'll have the authorities
deal with him tomorrow.

492
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:50,353
I'm gonna miss this.

493
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,820
What?

494
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:54,557
M-134 mini-gun.

495
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:56,493
3,400 rounds a minute.

496
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:58,363
Never got to use her.

497
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,567
Poor bastard.

498
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:04,734
Who?

499
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:06,369
Moron that's still in love with you.

500
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:08,604
I promise you, Casey,
he's not in love with me.

501
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:11,039
Oh, come on. I don't know
what happened between you two.

502
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:12,440
Don't want to.

503
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:14,542
Just saying I've seen men have
their fingernails pulled off

504
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,210
treated more humanely than you did that kid.

505
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:18,211
Well, I was just doing my job.

506
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,546
Job's over.

507
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,313
Put him out of his misery.

508
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:23,382
He deserves that much.

509
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,421
Oh.

510
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:39,125
* *

511
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:42,895
Wait a second.

512
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:45,330
Hello!

513
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:53,905
Uh... can I help you?

514
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:59,576
Where can I find this man?

515
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:00,910
Oh, don't ask me.

516
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:02,678
He's no longer an employee at this store.

517
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,147
If you want to find him,
you can walk out front

518
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:06,382
and follow the smell.

519
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:10,386
You can leave now.

520
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:15,291
Okay. Okay.

521
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,993
We can do this the easy way,

522
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:21,096
or the hard way.

523
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:22,431
I got Mace.

524
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:25,400
Yeah.

525
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:27,902
So you better get your Brokeback boots

526
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,403
off my property,

527
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:32,071
or I'm gonna send you crying
back to your mommy's womb.

528
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:36,775
Yeah.

529
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,311
Oh...

530
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:47,685
* *

531
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:02,527
<i>Say good-bye forever, pal.</i>

532
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:04,162
Had some good years here.

533
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,363
Yeah, to be honest,

534
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,432
I think I'd rather forget
it all ever happened.

535
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:12,769
Right. Uh, why don't I give
you guys a few seconds,

536
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,504
and I'll just see you back at your place?

537
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:15,671
Yeah.

538
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:16,672
Thanks, buddy. Yeah, yeah.

539
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,806
Hey, Sarah.

540
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:19,875
Hey.

541
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:27,848
I wanted to say a proper good-bye.

542
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:37,556
It's been a pleasure working
with you, Agent Walker.

543
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,059
You, too, Agent Bartowski.

544
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:44,462
I appreciate that, but I think we both know

545
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:48,298
that the whole agent thing
didn't really work out.

546
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:49,432
If I could go back in time...

547
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,667
Uh, Chuck?

548
00:28:50,734 --> 00:28:51,934
Please, Sarah, let me get this off my chest.

549
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:53,669
Okay, at least I can live knowing

550
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:55,104
that I told you everything about how I felt.

551
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:56,872
You owe me that. No. Chuck...

552
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:01,776
And I owed you that.

553
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:40,197
Oh, Javier.

554
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:43,500
Uh, you know, I think we actually got off

555
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:44,835
on the wrong foot.

556
00:29:44,902 --> 00:29:46,603
Truth be told, I'm a huge
fan of mariachi music.

557
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,705
And my hitting you was
completely unintentional.

558
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:52,074
I want to know who you are.

559
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:53,608
Nobody. I'm nobody.

560
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:56,008
In fact, I think that I
have documentation somewhere

561
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:58,339
that-that proves that
I'm an official nobody.

562
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:00,704
Wow. You are extremely ripped, sir.

563
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,505
You hit me very well outside the club.

564
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:08,276
Try that again.

565
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:11,378
Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

566
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,948
Shh. Freaking flash. Come on!

567
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:17,115
If you could just give me one second.

568
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:28,760
You're going to tell me everything,
Mr. Bartowski.

569
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,161
All the secrets you know.

570
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:34,197
Who you are, who you work for.

571
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,367
And then, you're going to
tell me about the girl.

572
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:43,037
<i>For now, you should go to Prague,</i>

573
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:45,039
<i>and then meet me at the
Nadrazi train station</i>

574
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:46,674
in three weeks' time at 7:00,

575
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:49,376
<i>and then we can figure the rest out
later.</i>

576
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:05,057
* *

577
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,835
Here is your ticket and your new passport.

578
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:20,737
Your name is Hector Caldaron.

579
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:22,438
Sarah, wait. We have plenty of time to talk

580
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,172
on the train. Right now we have to act fast.

581
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,874
Trust me, Chuck.
It's all going to work out fine.

582
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:48,325
That's not the kiss that I was expecting.

583
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,095
Sarah, there is an entire facility here

584
00:31:52,163 --> 00:31:54,931
dedicated and designed to
turning me into Intersect 2.0.

585
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,298
I mean, think about it.

586
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,666
Think about that.

587
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:00,134
Me, a real spy, you know,
living a life of adventure,

588
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:01,804
and doing things that really matter.

589
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,039
It's not that simple.

590
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:05,241
You don't know who you're working for.

591
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:06,909
It's complicated. Nothing is real.

592
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,410
This...

593
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,913
This is simple.

594
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:14,082
This is a real life.

595
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:18,519
We have to go, Chuck. This is it.

596
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:20,721
Are you coming?

597
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,724
* *

598
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:45,575
I can't.

599
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:51,446
I'm sorr

600
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:56,483
I'm sorry.

601
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:03,521
<i>Any sign of Walker?</i>

602
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,223
<i>Last ping had her at the Buy More.</i>

603
00:33:13,463 --> 00:33:15,797
You gotta be kidding me.

604
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,665
I want a real-time satellite
trace on every car

605
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:19,033
that's been in the Buy More parking lot

606
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:20,602
in the last six hours. Do it.

607
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:22,070
Get the chopper read Sir,
on whose authority?

608
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:24,238
Mine.

609
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,473
The Colonel.

610
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,475
Come on, Chuck. You can do this.

611
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,744
Just one flash of kung fu

612
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,646
and we are out of here.

613
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:37,579
I'm dead.

614
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:40,580
I'm so completely dead.

615
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:42,448
What am I going to do?

616
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:44,483
Chuck. Chuck,

617
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:46,318
can you hear me?

618
00:33:46,385 --> 00:33:47,819
Sarah?

619
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:49,820
I need you to break out of
your cell and come and get me.

620
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,488
I couldn't pick this stupid lock!

621
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:53,056
There's no way

622
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:54,927
Chuck. that we could reverse
those roles, is there?

623
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:56,933
You can do this.
You've been trained to do this.

624
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,136
The Intersect can do this.

625
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,172
Sarah, you don't get it.

626
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,441
You and Casey were right, okay.

627
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:01,475
I'm-I'm a lemon.

628
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:02,509
I don't work.

629
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:05,645
My emotions just mess everything up.

630
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,146
No.

631
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,114
Chuck, listen, I was mad...

632
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:10,149
and wrong.

633
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,583
And ever since you went to Prague,

634
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,218
I have worked with the
best spies in the world.

635
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,318
And you know what?

636
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,454
They're on their way here to save us?

637
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,456
None of them can do what you can do.

638
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,524
You're a spy.

639
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,926
Now flash on Javier and get us out of here.

640
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:26,829
Something's happening here, Sarah.

641
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:27,864
Chuck.

642
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:30,266
Don't freak out.

643
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,839
When I'm done with you,

644
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:43,541
I'm going to deal with her.

645
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:44,909
The girl.

646
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,915
Me first.

647
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,421
Chuck?

648
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:02,022
What happened?

649
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:06,693
Something... awesome!

650
00:35:08,562 --> 00:35:09,729
Thank you.

651
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,270
Let's go. No. Hey, you should've seen it.

652
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:19,604
I knocked him out with one punch.

653
00:35:19,672 --> 00:35:21,238
One punch. That's great. Let's talk and run.

654
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:23,305
<i>Where are we?</i>

655
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,352
Chuck, I'm almost out. We need to get off

656
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,787
this roof.

657
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:54,900
What are you doing?

658
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:56,001
Zip line.

659
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:57,803
It'll work. I promise.

660
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:00,106
Okay. I trust you.

661
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:05,510
Hold on tight.

662
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,787
I...

663
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:19,121
I can't believe that worked!

664
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:21,089
I'm not so sure it did.

665
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,235
Sarah... there's something
I need to tell you.

666
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,270
Not now, Chuck.

667
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:42,505
Actually, I think this
might be my last chance.

668
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:55,649
Oh, get down!

669
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,360
Javier Cruz was a vital operative

670
00:37:36,427 --> 00:37:37,960
for The Ring's Mexico Syndicate.

671
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:39,462
The device you picked up

672
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,631
is a custom smart phone for Ring operatives.

673
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:43,866
This is the first one we have ever captured.

674
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,901
Hey, good job, Team Bartowski.

675
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:47,302
General, Colonel Casey and I

676
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,837
will be departing for Lisbon tonight.

677
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:50,038
There's been chatter

678
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:51,305
that another Ring cell is operating there.

679
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:53,274
That won't be necessary.

680
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:55,542
Why not?

681
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,844
I can't believe I'm about to say this...

682
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:58,612
Say it.

683
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:00,680
I mean...

684
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:03,548
:...please say it.

685
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:07,920
I'm putting Operation
Bartowski back into the field.

686
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:09,021
Yes!

687
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,756
Casey, Sarah,

688
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:13,258
you will work alongside Agent Bartowski

689
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,758
to bring down the Ring.

690
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,093
That is all.

691
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,528
This is great!

692
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,096
This is great. Come on, guys.

693
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,631
The three of us, the old gang,
back together again.

694
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,699
I cannot wait.

695
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:24,866
Hey, what's my new cover going to be?

696
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:25,900
'Cause I-I need a new job.

697
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:27,067
Can it be something exciting?

698
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:28,102
Race car driver?

699
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:29,703
Hmm?

700
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:31,705
It's gotta be something cool.

701
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:33,240
* *

702
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:37,277
Oh, wow.

703
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:40,113
I can't believe you got me
this job back so quickly.

704
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,714
Yeah, well, with no manager,

705
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:43,415
the paperwork was easy to push through.

706
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:45,781
So, Emmett really took a
Large Mart job in Anchorage?

707
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:47,714
. Well, good for him.

708
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:50,850
Oh, also, thanks for doing that extra favor.

709
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:52,551
What?

710
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,552
I speak of the bearded one.

711
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,554
MORGAN : We're back!

712
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:58,856
Up high.

713
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:02,358
There he goes.

714
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:04,026
There he goes. He's busy.

715
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,694
Work, work, work, that guy.

716
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,696
Are you ready for this?
Someone from corporate called me

717
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,730
and pretty much begged
me to take my job back.

718
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:11,065
Did they? I'm serious.

719
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,367
I guess they know talent.

720
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,102
They do indeed, my friend.

721
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:20,239
<i>Sarah, I need you</i>

722
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:23,140
to keep Chuck's emotions in
check so the Intersect can work.

723
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,309
He listens to you,
but halso an unstable element.

724
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:27,877
Do you think he's dangerous?

725
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:31,446
Very, but he's worth the risk.

726
00:39:31,514 --> 00:39:34,448
For the last two years,
we protected Chuck from the world.

727
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:38,018
But, now, we have to protect
the world from Chuck.

728
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:46,758
Hey, do we really need all this stuff?

729
00:39:46,826 --> 00:39:48,660
Oh, hey, guys.

730
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:50,161
Hey, Devon.

731
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:51,796
Hey, El. What's happening?

732
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:54,165
Uh, well, we're moving.

733
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:55,666
Yeah, the, uh, the apartment

734
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:57,101
across the courtyard opened up. So,

735
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:58,335
we're taking it.

736
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:04,307
We needed a place for two
and you can get a roommate.

737
00:40:04,374 --> 00:40:06,308
You know? You have plenty of friends.

738
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:08,076
I'm so happy right now.

739
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:10,145
Other friends, Chuck.

740
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:12,180
Other friends.

741
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,983
Uh... listen to me, listen to me. Two words.

742
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,684
Bachelor pad.

743
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:18,818
Yes!

744
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:19,819
I got dibs on Ellie's room.

745
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:21,887
Okay.

746
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:25,323
Chuck.

747
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,026
We should talk.

748
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,195
Absolutely.

749
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:42,970
I'll go first. I'll go first. Sure.

750
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,541
Sarah, they wanted me to be a spy, okay.

751
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,544
They told me

752
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:53,979
that I could make a difference.

753
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:57,616
For years, I been... I been kicking around

754
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:59,283
not knowing what I wanted to do with my life

755
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:00,551
like a... like a loser.

756
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:05,389
that they thoughtreally I
could change the world.

757
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:07,190
Me. Chuck Bartowski.

758
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:10,493
It was never about you...

759
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:11,661
Stop.

760
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:16,965
I acted impulsively.

761
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:20,034
And it's a mistake I don't usually make.

762
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:22,369
And it won't happen again.

763
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:24,404
But, Sarah...

764
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:26,339
You're a spy now, Chuck.

765
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:30,542
You have to keep your feelings to yourself.

766
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,816
Numbnuts.

767
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:40,851
Ready?

768
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,186
Ready for what?

769
00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:45,187
Your training. Come on.

770
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:49,024
* *

771
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:53,895
You have much to learn, grasshopper.

772
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,867
Have you flashed yet?

773
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:03,269
Take a breath.

774
00:42:08,174 --> 00:42:10,375
Let's do this.

775
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:19,377
