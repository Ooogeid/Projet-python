1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:02,580
<i>I'm Chuck. Here are some things
that you might need to know.</i>

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:05,004
<i>I programmed it to remove
the Intersect from Chuck's head.</i>

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,340
It's over, Chuck.
The Intersect is out.

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,216
- You're a spy?
- Yeah, more or less.

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,217
Awesome!

6
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,887
- Don't you have a dream?
- I'd like to be a Benihana chef.

7
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,816
- Morgan out.
- You're free, Morgan!

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,394
- Where have you been?
- I was getting your wedding present.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,519
Dad...

10
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:26,859
- Where're you headed?
- Burbank. Got a wedding to go to.

11
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:02,353
Thank you for joining us.

12
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:04,756
I've waited a long time
for this day.

13
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:08,567
Thought of many ways to say it out loud,
how it'd feel to get it off of my chest.

14
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:11,176
Let me stop you, Chuck.

15
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:14,073
I am incredibly flattered.

16
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:18,035
But I am a flaming heterosexual.

17
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,351
What?

18
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:24,917
No, I'm, I'm out of here. I'm done.

19
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:27,738
Leaving is not the answer.

20
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:31,419
I am just touched
that you are taking it so hard.

21
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:33,759
You don't understand!
I quit!

22
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:36,203
No more Buy More.
No more you.

23
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,473
You can take your flag
and your job and shove it.

24
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:41,857
Ditto.

25
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,895
What do you think you're gonna do
for the rest of your life?

26
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,488
Anything I want.

27
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:56,471
<i>What are your plans for the future?</i>

28
00:01:57,232 --> 00:02:00,494
I was gonna get a good champagne buzz
going on at my sister's wedding

29
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,330
followed by a nice extra-long
slow dance with my date.

30
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,357
Vocationally speaking?

31
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:10,588
That, no, nothing,
nothing lined up just yet.

32
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,424
<i>How would you feel about working
on the new Intersect project?</i>

33
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:15,968
<i>The government has been rebuilding
his own Intersect.</i>

34
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,972
You've shown real promise.
We'd like you to be an analyst.

35
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,558
Your country is calling you,
Mr. Bartowski.

36
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,685
My country might have
the wrong number,

37
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,814
'cause I'm just Chuck Bartowski,
not a hero.

38
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,425
<i>Very well.</i>

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,695
<i>I guess that concludes
"Project Bartowski".</i>

40
00:02:37,022 --> 00:02:38,824
<i>Please issue Mr. Bartowski
his final papers</i>

41
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,203
<i>before you and your Special Forces team
ship out to Waziristan.</i>

42
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,582
<i>I'll need you for a moment.</i>

43
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:57,107
- What is this?
- Your pay packet, numbnuts.

44
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,308
If you were a true patriot,
you wouldn't even cash it.

45
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:15,346
Thank you for saving my life
at least once a week.

46
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:20,616
See?

47
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:22,594
Guys can hug.

48
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,911
Not if they don't have
their man parts.

49
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,330
That's a good point.

50
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,364
You've done good work here.

51
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,386
In case of emergencies.
My personal number, but,

52
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:44,608
your fingers better be on fire
when you're dialing.

53
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:50,354
You'll surely be pleased to be in charge
of the new Intersect project,

54
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,539
working in tandem with Agent Larkin.

55
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,941
And this time,
the Intersect goes in my head.

56
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,573
Now that we've got the Cube,

57
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,601
it's ready for upload.

58
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:03,200
<i>You leave for Zurich together
at 08:00.</i>

59
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,999
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

60
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:08,346
Walker and Larkin...

61
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,165
together again.

62
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,505
Finally, you can get out of here.

63
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,962
The Yvonne's Team presents:

64
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,052
Season 2 - Episode 22
<i>Chuck Versus the Ring</i>

65
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:50,497
Sub-way.fr (v1.00)

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,395
Everything is gonna be perfect.
I had your Toyota washed for you.

67
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,312
Perfect, thanks, bro.

68
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,068
I'll be right back.

69
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,968
Just a second.

70
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,866
Hi, can I talk to my sister
a second?

71
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,607
It's bad luck to see the bride.

72
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,880
It's fine,
I don't believe in that stuff.

73
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,670
All right, get in.

74
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,830
What?

75
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:51,160
Look at you.
Your dreams are coming true.

76
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,735
If it were up to me,

77
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:56,611
I would be a small ceremony on a beach.
Sand between my toes, people I love.

78
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,156
But we all make sacrifices
for family, right?

79
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:00,912
One, two, three...

80
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,362
Where is my blonde?

81
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,155
Anyway,

82
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:08,701
I don't know exactly yet
what I'm gonna get you for your present.

83
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:11,549
But I'll start with this:

84
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:13,676
I quit the Buy More today.

85
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:14,905
What?

86
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,876
The Buy More is no more.

87
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:20,671
Chuck, that is incredible.

88
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:24,008
- What are you gonna do in the future?
- I don't know.

89
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,936
There she is!

90
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,434
I made my dreams come true.

91
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,734
What are you gonna do about yours?

92
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:40,274
Sarah, can we talk, for a moment?

93
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:44,361
I wanted to tell...

94
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,974
Ellie wanted me to make sure
that you have the rings.

95
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:57,291
You look like a real spy.

96
00:06:58,381 --> 00:06:59,918
You look like a real bridesmaid.

97
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,425
Wait...

98
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,396
- I have something to tell you.
- I can't wait.

99
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,643
I can't wait any longer.

100
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:15,100
Everyone's asking me
what I'm going to do in the future,

101
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,357
and the truth is,
I don't have a clue.

102
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:20,084
All I do know
is that I want you to be in it.

103
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,895
- I really have to tell you.
- No.

104
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:24,443
No guns, no lies,

105
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:26,022
just us.

106
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,505
Just like I've always wanted it.

107
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,245
I've recently come
into a bit of money.

108
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,660
Any place you want to go,

109
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,876
any place at all,
as long as it's sunny,

110
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:39,131
with little umbrella drinks.

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
What I'm getting at here is...

112
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,799
Sarah Walker,
will you do me the honor

113
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,376
of taking a vacation with me?

114
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,473
I'm leaving in the morning.

115
00:07:56,882 --> 00:07:58,602
The details are classified

116
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,380
but I'm working
on the new Intersect project,

117
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:03,821
with Bryce.

118
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:11,615
I'm sorry. I wanted to wait
after the ceremony to tell you.

119
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,475
Thank you for coming to the wedding.

120
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:24,376
Good for the cover.

121
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,677
Today's a day
we'll remember forever, son.

122
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:21,977
Oh, my God!

123
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,647
I think we've met before.

124
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,402
No, I'm Ted Roark.

125
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,863
You're the CIA agent
who's in deep trouble.

126
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:35,791
By the way,

127
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,076
congratulations
on your sister's happy day.

128
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,412
Her gown is gorgeous.

129
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,873
Full bodice, love the beading.

130
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:45,292
What the hell do you want?

131
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,045
No need to curse.

132
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,215
You know damn well what I want.

133
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:54,885
The Intersect Cube.

134
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,263
I can't, I can't give you that.

135
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,098
You'll find a way, I'm sure.

136
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,316
Sorry, I forgot the threat part.

137
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,441
If you don't deliver the Cube
within a half hour,

138
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,559
40 minutes tops with traffic,

139
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,139
I'm gonna kill the bride.

140
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:18,033
Nice.

141
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,294
Chuck, can I talk to you?

142
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,419
- I'm feeling a little nervous.
- Sorry, I can't talk right now.

143
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,343
What's the matter?
Tell me, I could help.

144
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:44,059
It's the rings.
I have to go home and get them.

145
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:48,105
Find Sarah, pull her aside,
and tell her that I forgot the rings.

146
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,107
The wedding'll start.
Ellie's gonna kill you.

147
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,421
Thanks for that.

148
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:53,527
Unless... I stall the wedding.

149
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:56,938
No one will know you're gone.
They'll blame me. It'll be fine.

150
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,008
- You'd do that for me?
- Of course.

151
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:02,660
You've saved my ass a million times.
It's my turn to I saved yours. But go.

152
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,002
What is that smell?

153
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,461
There he is!

154
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:15,757
Ladies.

155
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,759
You get soft without me?

156
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,422
- It's been a while. Good to see you.
- Yeah, a long time...

157
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,889
- Come on, Casey.
<i>- This is Casey. Leave a message.</i>

158
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,936
Who's ready to do some hunting?

159
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,188
- Dr. Awesome.
- Don't take another step.

160
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:33,483
- My wife warned me about you.
- Good warnings, I hope.

161
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:36,361
Retreat two steps back.

162
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,781
I need to get in there.

163
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,951
Dr. Woodcomb,
your wife wants me to tell you

164
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,153
to go to the car
and get backup hosiery.

165
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:47,998
- Does that make sense?
- Man my post. Don't let this one in.

166
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,339
Listen to me. Chuck forgot the rings,
so he went home to go get them.

167
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,483
- What?
- The wedding rings. He blew it.

168
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:02,012
I have to stall the wedding.
How do I stall a wedding?

169
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:04,890
Do it, Morgan,
by any means necessary.

170
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:10,145
How do I stall this wedding?
Think, man.

171
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:18,653
It's gone.

172
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,925
- To the new Intersect.
- Where? Where is it?!

173
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:25,035
You know I can't tell you that.
That's top secret.

174
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,037
I need it, Bryce.
My family's in danger.

175
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:29,247
Ted Roark and his team
are at the wedding.

176
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,815
He'll kill Ellie
if I don't bring him the Cube.

177
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,212
- Roark can't have it.
- No. He'll murder everyone.

178
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:37,672
No.
You're going to give them me.

179
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:45,335
- They think you're the Intersect.
- They've been looking for me all along.

180
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,141
The Cube can't fall into wrong hands.
I made a promise to Orion.

181
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:52,468
- You knew.
- That was the deal.

182
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:56,030
Your dad knew for Stanford.
I was the only spy he would trust.

183
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,894
I can't believe
you've known this whole time.

184
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:04,922
He wanted to keep you out of this.

185
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:09,454
But I knew you could had the Intersect,
that Sarah would find you,

186
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:13,393
and most importantly, you deserved
to know the truth about your father.

187
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:14,618
He's a hero.

188
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,006
Let's go get your sister married.

189
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,333
What's the holdup?

190
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,934
The bride is perfect.
She'll only wilt from here.

191
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,937
- We can't find Chuck.
- The blonde is gone too.

192
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,357
- Just now?
- Yes.

193
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:39,243
Excuse me.

194
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:43,864
This is a really weird family.

195
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:51,380
Don't chew gum.

196
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,175
Something's wrong.

197
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,588
- Roark and his men are inside.
- He's alive?

198
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:03,875
- Did you bring a gun?
- I'll think of something.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,837
Check the chapel and the bridal chamber.
Make sure there's nobody else.

200
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,058
Use the South East entrance,
through the kitchen.

201
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:14,978
Okay, thanks.

202
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,073
It's on?

203
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,325
I'm Morgan Grimes,

204
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,660
unofficial member
of the wedding party.

205
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,291
We have some pre-wedding entertainment
planned for you guys.

206
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:39,169
So, without further ado,

207
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,172
I present to you Jeffster!

208
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,176
It's Jeffster!

209
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:49,471
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but it's just got good.

210
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,890
- We got the perfect song.
- Knock 'em dead.

211
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:54,976
This is in four/four time.
It's in D.

212
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,103
Watch me for the changes.

213
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,991
Morgan, you are ruining my wedding!

214
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,456
If you hit me,
know that it only teaches me to hit.

215
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:15,205
For reasons I cannot say,
I have to stall this wedding.

216
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,456
Why?

217
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,555
Chuck is in trouble,
and I'm saving him.

218
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,386
- Chuck told you to do this?
- Yes.

219
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:33,181
Okay, I'm with you.

220
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,667
Okay, no Sarah.

221
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,689
And that is definitely not
the wedding march.

222
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,681
Can one of you please go see
what's going on out there? Now!

223
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:44,806
Thank you.

224
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:46,695
Focus on the calm.

225
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:06,203
Why are you letting
Sam Kinison and an Indian lesbian

226
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:07,778
wreck your wedding?

227
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,293
Dad, just chill out, okay?

228
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,253
You know what?

229
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,607
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

230
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:25,322
Don't you dare!

231
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:31,239
If you ever want to see
the Intersect again,

232
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,147
you will not touch
anything in this room.

233
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,619
Do I make myself clear?

234
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,190
Today is my sister's wedding day,

235
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,624
and believe me,
you don't want to see her angry.

236
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:43,877
Where's the Intersect?

237
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:46,496
About that...

238
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,048
Kill him.

239
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,091
Ho down. Ho down.
I mean, hold on.

240
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,802
- Just hold on a second, all right?
- Finally.

241
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,056
I did bring "an" Intersect with me.

242
00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:57,891
"An" Intersect?

243
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,142
Mr. Roark.

244
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,326
Mr. Larkin.

245
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:11,376
The Human Intersect.

246
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,662
Roark, you want me.

247
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:21,706
Now let Chuck and his people go.
We leave,

248
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,111
they stay,
nobody else needs to know.

249
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:26,336
Terrific plan. Thing of it is,

250
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,880
Fulcrum wants Chuck here dead
no matter what.

251
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,675
So, with that said,
shoot Mr. Bartowski, or...

252
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,593
Sarah, take him.

253
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:40,433
Oh, God, not the flowers!

254
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,740
Oh, God, not the centerpieces.

255
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:01,621
- I'm dry. Any more knives?
- Nope. I threw all eight.

256
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,748
Get up!

257
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:12,882
Oh, God.

258
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:16,302
- Someone just shoot me now.
- I can help you with that.

259
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,540
A real shotgun wedding.

260
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:22,495
Just think,

261
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,437
that terrible pun
is the last thing you'll ever hear.

262
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,437
Waited 20 years to do that.

263
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,325
All clear, sir.

264
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:26,998
You rang.

265
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:41,253
- What happened?
- Everything's all right.

266
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,181
There was just
a minor centerpiece problem.

267
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,371
Wedding canceled.

268
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:14,712
This is officially a disaster.

269
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:20,343
I can't believe that my spy life
has wrecked my real life.

270
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Again.

271
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,306
I've completely ruined
my sister's wedding day.

272
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,974
I'm sorry, son. I...

273
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,479
If anyone knows how you feel,
it's me.

274
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:33,473
You had no choice, Charles.

275
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,098
You saved her life.

276
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,157
You're okay?

277
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:47,287
No, I'm not.

278
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:49,599
I'm not okay.

279
00:20:50,654 --> 00:20:53,808
I don't want to have to save my sister
using a Special Forces team.

280
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:57,060
I just want to be a normal guy

281
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:58,923
who helps his sister in normal ways.

282
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:04,856
Like right now, if I could give her
anything in the world,

283
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:06,387
I would...

284
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,491
I think I might know
how to fix this.

285
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,193
You got time for one more mission
before you take off?

286
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:35,919
It's not what a normal guy would do.

287
00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:47,639
Don't forget to lock it.

288
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:55,283
Yeah, Walker, what is it?

289
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:58,424
You're kidding.

290
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:01,027
Roger that. We're on it.

291
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,560
Ellie, are you all right?

292
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:11,246
Chuck, just please go away.

293
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,946
I can't believe
your idiot friends ruined my wedding.

294
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:29,371
I'm just... I'm never going
to forgive Morgan for this.

295
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,351
I think you're going to have to.

296
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:38,346
Because Morgan...

297
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,190
and Lester, and Jeff...

298
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:43,319
they only did
what I asked them to do.

299
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:47,657
What?

300
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:52,453
I did all this.
I forgot your rings.

301
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,523
So I told them to stall.

302
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:59,026
So if you're going to be mad at someone,
you should be mad at me.

303
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:03,793
Please say something.

304
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:07,709
You... ruined...

305
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:10,221
the most important day of my life.

306
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,092
Ellie, you have to trust me, okay.

307
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:20,104
Take these...

308
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:24,694
and I'll take care of the rest.

309
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,217
Trust me.

310
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:32,996
Sir, how do you spell begonia?

311
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,394
Sound it out.

312
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:37,180
That clashes with the bunting.

313
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:41,252
Yes, I appreciate that you require
extra time to permit the area,

314
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,655
but this is
a national security matter.

315
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:26,005
We are gathered here
to join together

316
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,840
Eleanor Faye Bartowski

317
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,190
and Devon Christian Woodcomb

318
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:31,465
in matrimony.

319
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,180
Who gives this woman in marriage
to this man?

320
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:36,946
- We do.
- We do.

321
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,752
- I love you.
- I love you.

322
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:05,938
Watch him.

323
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:12,894
A partnership should not be
entered into lightly,

324
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,179
but with much consideration.

325
00:25:16,513 --> 00:25:18,766
If any person can show just cause

326
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:21,185
why they should not be joined,

327
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,688
let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

328
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,868
You're not coming with me, are you?

329
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,064
Do you have the rings?

330
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:13,041
Was that... you were talking about,
secondhand smoke?

331
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:15,758
Three hundred.

332
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,100
Roark wants to talk to you.

333
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,147
Watch my cards.

334
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:32,858
Don't cheat.

335
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,362
Better not be about food.

336
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:25,543
Don't!

337
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,626
Sorry. We've been through a lot.

338
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,554
How long you been Fulcrum?

339
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:34,211
I'm not with Fulcrum.

340
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:38,810
Go ahead and pull the trigger.
I don't want to look at your face.

341
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:41,685
You just killed three Marines
in cold blood.

342
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,600
But none of them saved my life.

343
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,163
- Thank you.
- For what?

344
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,620
For what? For all of this.

345
00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:12,958
For my wedding gift.

346
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:16,420
This is...
I don't how you did all this.

347
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,216
I can't exactly take all the credit.

348
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,769
First the beach and now this.

349
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:24,457
I don't know.

350
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:27,217
You're pretty amazing,
little brother.

351
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,191
Sometimes I think
you have super powers.

352
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,395
- I wish.
- I know.

353
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,899
Man, you saved the day.

354
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,149
Looks like you're the big hero.

355
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:42,405
Thanks, bro.

356
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,698
Now I really am your bro.

357
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,010
Yes, you are.

358
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,164
I can't believe
you're actually leaving me.

359
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:04,257
- Don't, Chuck. I'll cry.
- We don't want that now, do we?

360
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:06,429
I'm happy for you.

361
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:10,307
I think that you are going to be
the greatest Hibachi chef in the world.

362
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,565
I don't know. This whole... "making
your dreams come true thing" is hard.

363
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,688
And the bigger the dream,
the harder it gets.

364
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,858
You know, on one side,
the girl you love.

365
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,818
And then on the other,
life as you know it.

366
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:24,989
It's just, you know, friends and family,
and job you can't stand.

367
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,240
I don't know.
I should just go with Anna, right?

368
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:29,577
But then I,
I'm overthinking this, aren't I?

369
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:30,953
Yeah, you are.

370
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:33,247
Go with your heart, buddy.

371
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,549
Our brains only screw things up.

372
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:51,028
Where's Bryce?

373
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:52,434
Gone.

374
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:55,997
They're uploading him
with the new computer tonight.

375
00:30:56,594 --> 00:30:58,191
Off to save the world.

376
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:01,196
I guess both of you are.

377
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:03,856
You want to dance?

378
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:07,907
You know I do.

379
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,800
Mr. Bartowski.

380
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:43,811
- Or is this an Orion conversation?
- A bit of both.

381
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:49,114
I reconfigured the Cube for you
under two conditions:

382
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:52,326
You stop looking for me,
and you leave my son alone.

383
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,411
We asked Chuck to be on my team.
He said no.

384
00:31:58,218 --> 00:32:00,793
- Good-bye, Orion.
- You made changes...

385
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,511
to the Intersect.
To my initial designs.

386
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:07,007
The data architecture is different.
What does this new computer do?

387
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:10,094
You don't want to know.

388
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:12,346
Agent Larkin.
It's time to go.

389
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:33,435
You belong out there,
saving the world.

390
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,457
I'm just...

391
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,110
I'm just not that guy.

392
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,379
How many times do you have to be a hero
to realize that you are that guy?

393
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:48,673
But I want more, Sarah.

394
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:51,731
I want a life.

395
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:54,363
I want a real life.

396
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,935
I don't want to save the world.

397
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,608
- Chuck, the agent...
- I want...

398
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,777
the agent who came for Bryce...

399
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,540
he isn't a CIA agent.

400
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:12,495
He's supposed to be dead.

401
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,075
How could you possibly know that?

402
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,165
Screw it. I...
I have an Intersect in my head.

403
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:25,210
I tested the computer on myself.
I was young and stupid,

404
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,028
but the intel was good.

405
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,464
That man isn't CIA.

406
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,177
- Bryce is getting the upload tonight.
- They're going to kill him.

407
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,346
They'll download the Intersect
into their team.

408
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,681
If they know about Bryce,
they know about Casey.

409
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,771
Let her go. You've done your part.

410
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,523
- No, I have to go.
- No... no, you don't.

411
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,560
- You're not a spy.
- Dad...

412
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,237
I love her.

413
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:03,457
I can't follow you, son,

414
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:05,026
but take this.

415
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:12,403
Thank you.

416
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,637
- Be safe, Charles.
- Thank you.

417
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:22,434
- I'm coming with you.
- It's not your mission.

418
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:26,021
Wait... this is the Interect
we're talking about and I'm a Bartowski.

419
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,940
You need me.

420
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:32,192
Let's go.

421
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:44,694
- Did you see her?
- Agent Walker?

422
00:34:45,612 --> 00:34:48,012
- She was amazing, right?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,679
She loves another guy.

424
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,675
- Bad day to be me.
- You have no idea.

425
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,187
Mr. Larkin.

426
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:15,524
Open this door!

427
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,040
They're already here.

428
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,890
- Bryce must be in the vault!
- Chuck, go get help.

429
00:35:57,831 --> 00:35:58,831
Help!

430
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:10,417
Bryce, Casey and Sarah
are pinned down outside.

431
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
I'm on it.

432
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,760
Oh, my God...

433
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,214
Oh, my God, you've been shot.

434
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:29,090
I'm really sorry about this, Chuck.

435
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:31,845
No, it's okay...

436
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,865
You're going to be fine...
it's not that bad.

437
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,820
- Take care of her.
- Don't say that. You're not dying.

438
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,738
She needs you, man, okay?

439
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,907
You guys are going to go
on missions together

440
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,383
and do exciting things
and save the world.

441
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:46,861
You'll be a team again,
it will be great.

442
00:36:47,592 --> 00:36:49,342
She wasn't going to come.

443
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,253
- She wants...
- Come on. Hold on, hold on.

444
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:02,845
This will destroy the Intersect.
This new computer is too powerful.

445
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,463
It's too dangerous.

446
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:10,644
But you need the computer
to fight Fulcrum.

447
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,753
Fulcrum doesn't matter, all right?

448
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:16,567
They're just...
they're just one part of the Ring.

449
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,737
They'll use it against us, Chuck.
You have to do this.

450
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,905
All right?

451
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:24,825
You have to destroy that computer,
and then get out of here.

452
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:28,120
But you can beat them.

453
00:37:30,454 --> 00:37:31,754
You're a real...

454
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,392
hero, Bryce.

455
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:43,686
Oh, my God.

456
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:09,620
I can't figure out why Bryce did this,
why he chose me.

457
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,874
You can do anything.
I've seen you in action.

458
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,961
<i>You can't put him out in the field.
He won't survive.</i>

459
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,215
- <i>It's time for you to become a spy.</i>
- I'm just Chuck Bartowski, not a hero.

460
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:26,474
<i>How many times do you have to be a hero
to realize that you are that guy?</i>

461
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:37,312
What did you do?

462
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:42,629
What did you do?!

463
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:46,013
I destroyed it.

464
00:39:46,504 --> 00:39:48,844
- You're too late.
- For that, you'll die last.

465
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,645
Bryce, help me.

466
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:00,873
Don't you touch him!

467
00:40:11,102 --> 00:40:12,652
There's nothing left.

468
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,202
So, you lose.

469
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,587
You should know this.

470
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:25,255
No one stops us.

471
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,760
- No one ever has.
- Who are you?

472
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:32,034
Spies, Agent Walker.

473
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,556
The best.

474
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,057
You should look at this.

475
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,176
Chuck, did you just flash?

476
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:52,866
- He uploaded it.
- Chuck me.

477
00:40:54,926 --> 00:40:55,926
Kill him.

478
00:41:58,401 --> 00:41:59,401
Guys...

479
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:03,774
I know kung fu.
