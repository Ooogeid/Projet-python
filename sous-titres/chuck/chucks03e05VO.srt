1
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,102
The old heated doorknob. Nice try.

2
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,302
Lester, you still giving me the silent treatment?

3
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:46,769
Okay.

4
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,735
Everybody, good morning.

5
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:49,769
Good morning.

6
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:50,769
Your coffee, sir.

7
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:52,469
Ah, jeffrey, thank you so much.

8
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,102
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

9
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:00,635
You know, call me old-fashioned, but...

10
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:02,969
I just... I prefer cream over laxative.

11
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,568
I need everybody's attention.

12
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,935
I know some of you are unhappy that I'm running the buy more.

13
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:11,469
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:13,735
But all your little tricks and your tactics...

15
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:15,369
I know them all.

16
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:16,602
I taught you them.

17
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:17,802
So listen up.

18
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,969
No more sabotage.

19
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:21,735
Thank you.

20
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:22,735
Lester, you're in my chair.

21
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:24,535
If there's one thing I learned in hawaii,

22
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:26,403
is that I'm good at this, men.

23
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,436
I am good at the buy more.

24
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:38,436
Do me a favor and grab chuck for me?

25
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:41,136
Could somebody grab chuck for me?

26
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,503
Hey, jeff, can you send chuck back here for me?

27
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:44,702
Chuck!

28
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:47,403
Casey, I want to ask you about a beastmaster.

29
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,403
Really?

30
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,269
No, not really.

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,102
Hey, have we got any more info

32
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,602
on you-know-who down in castle?

33
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:56,169
Shaw? Yeah, yeah, shaw.

34
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:57,403
I'm busy here, chuck. Why don't you

35
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,602
talk to him yourself? He's living there.

36
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,602
Living in castle. What? What?!

37
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:02,336
Casey, what's going on?

38
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:04,202
Is he really in charge of our team?

39
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:07,635
Shaw's a special agent for the cia.

40
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:09,668
He can do pretty much whatever he wants.

41
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,036
Even more special than me?

42
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:12,302
It gets worse.

43
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,036
Whenever a special agent takes over an operation,

44
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,602
they conduct a review.

45
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,302
Sarah's in there with him right now.

46
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:19,169
What do you think they're talking about?

47
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:21,102
Is chuck bartkowski a real spy?

48
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,202
Yes, of course he is.

49
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,635
I mean, his training has been irregular

50
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:29,036
and he was a civilian only two years ago.

51
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:30,835
Well, these mission reports tell a different story.

52
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,136
Sometimes he sounds like bond,

53
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:34,169
and other times it's like a jerry lewis movie.

54
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:35,369
I need to know,

55
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:36,602
is chuck a liability?

56
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,136
Wait. The review's about me?!

57
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:39,568
Shouldn't shaw be asking me about me?

58
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,202
Where's the fun in that?

59
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,369
Look, I am never gonna be able to escape this ridiculous cover

60
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:48,236
if shaw thinks I'm some moron civilian

61
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,869
who just got unlucky enough to get

62
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,336
a computer dumped in his head.

63
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:53,668
Fine.

64
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,336
Help.

65
00:02:55,403 --> 00:02:57,869
Morgan, did you get glued to a chair?

66
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,835
Yes. Yes, I did, okay?

67
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:01,702
The whole store's coming after me, dude.

68
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,102
Lester went mute and refuses to talk to me.

69
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,769
Maybe 'cause you fired him?

70
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:06,902
I don't know.

71
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,036
They've teamed up and formed,

72
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:09,369
like, an evil cabal of tricksters.

73
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:11,935
I haven't had an untainted cup of coffee in days.

74
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:13,269
I need my free coffee, dude.

75
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,002
You know, you give me five minutes running

76
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,535
this popsicle stand, and we'd be ready.

77
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,036
Ready for what?

78
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:20,236
The russians.

79
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,269
Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey.

80
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,269
Guys, a little help.

81
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,568
Is that-is that shaw?

82
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:29,403
Listen, I'm an integral member of this team, okay?

83
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,036
My voice should be heard.

84
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:32,835
Oh, your prepubescent little girl screams

85
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,002
are gonna be duly noted.

86
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,236
Actually, right now. He wants to see you.

87
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,602
Look, shaw, I'm quite certain that things have been said

88
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:48,769
about either myself or my abilities as a spy,

89
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,869
and while I concede that there are more traditional

90
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,202
or professional spies out there...

91
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,403
Chuck, this is my meeting.

92
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,069
Right. Sorry.

93
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,403
Please continue.

94
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:00,069
I think we can all agree that this team

95
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,769
has been dysfunctional the last two years.

96
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:04,635
And I think I know what the problem is.

97
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,568
The problem is them.

98
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:08,635
What?

99
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:09,436
What does that mean?

100
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:10,535
It means he's a moron.

101
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,102
Chuck, they coddle you.

102
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,436
You could be a great spy, but they won't let you evolve.

103
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:15,869
Really?

104
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:18,102
I mean, yes, yes, really. He's right.

105
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,302
Let me be a spy.

106
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:20,935
Let me out of the car. I'm ready.

107
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,635
No, shaw, he's not.

108
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:24,935
Duly noted... And ignored.

109
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,580
Chuck ***

110
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,469
Undercover in paris.

111
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,469
Are you ready?

112
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:38,735
Absolutely.

113
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:19,688
Um, so what are we doing here exactly?

114
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,149
Since your intersect skills can be glitchy,

115
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,516
you'll need some basic spycraft

116
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,015
for this mission.

117
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,349
Have you ever used one of these?

118
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,582
A pen?

119
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,082
Kgb-model tranq pen.

120
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:31,416
Oh, yeah, casey's got one of these.

121
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:34,182
Aim it at your target's food or drink,

122
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,149
and it's bedtime for bad guy.

123
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,948
You want me to tranq jeff?

124
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:41,915
I can't do that.

125
00:05:41,982 --> 00:05:43,015
I've read everyone's file.

126
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:44,616
Jeff barnes will be just fine.

127
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:46,315
Come on, chuck, are you up for this?

128
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,682
Yeah.

129
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:51,948
Hey, jeffy-jeff.

130
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:53,282
How's it hanging, brother?

131
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:54,816
Everything okay? Yeah.

132
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:58,315
Um, what do you mean, "okay"?

133
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:00,349
What are you doing?

134
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,382
You don't usually check up on me like this.

135
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,449
Did I do something wrong?

136
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,382
No, no, no, no, buddy.

137
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,649
Everything's fine.

138
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:10,015
You're fine, work's fine, you know.

139
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:12,048
This is more of a checking in.

140
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,215
Just making sure that you're feeling okay.

141
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:15,716
Just a little human-

142
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,883
To-humanoid

143
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,215
interaction, so...

144
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,048
Good.

145
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,915
Thanks, yeah. Little bit of a rocky start,

146
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:26,716
but I think I finished strong. What's next?

147
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:28,315
Let's go.

148
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:29,616
You're ready.

149
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,382
Wh... Whoa. I am?

150
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,082
I'm ready after 20 seconds?

151
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:34,716
After two years.

152
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:37,048
I just wanted to talk to you privately, chuck.

153
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:38,282
Listen, you've been on more missions

154
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,482
than most spies have been in a lifetime.

155
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:42,582
Trust me, you're ready.

156
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,915
Ah...

157
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:53,783
Freshly brewed, untouched by jeff's lips.

158
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,582
Checkmate, lester. Checkmate.

159
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,948
As assistant manager,

160
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:01,282
I claim this cup of coffee for me.

161
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,482
Mmm.

162
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,182
Okay, that's what I'm talking...

163
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:06,749
You guys got to understand something.

164
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:08,948
You got to get up pretty early to get...

165
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:13,215
A cia contact will meet you in paris.

166
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,948
You're traveling as carmichael,

167
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,749
a successful businessman.

168
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,549
Itinerary and passport.

169
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,249
Guys, it's all good. I'm ready, okay?

170
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:23,249
What are these?

171
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,082
Nunchakus.

172
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,749
You know very well

173
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,015
that I don't like carrying guns around.

174
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:34,149
But I thought it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have

175
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,649
some kind of offensive weapon, you know,

176
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,816
just to have with me just in case.

177
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:41,616
And they're supposed to be in the intersect, so...

178
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,149
Casey, can I have a second?

179
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:45,349
Hmm? Yeah.

180
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,482
Listen, I know you want this

181
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:53,482
to work and you want to impress shaw, but this is crazy.

182
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,416
Okay, fine, the nunchakus are a little crazy.

183
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:56,816
You weren't supposed to see those.

184
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:58,182
But shaw-- an honest-to-god,

185
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,416
real-life special agent for the cia--

186
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,816
Thinks that I'm ready.

187
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,682
He thinks that I can do it,

188
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,482
and I want to prove to him that he's not wrong about me.

189
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,149
I'm not saying that you can't do this,

190
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:11,349
but please...

191
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,282
Please just don't go now.

192
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,282
Okay? You need more time.

193
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,482
He's going.

194
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,649
Beckman agrees with me.

195
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,115
We set up a subnetwork on your phone.

196
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:26,149
You'll be able to text and call from the plane.

197
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,849
Your ticket, and your car's waiting outside.

198
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,915
You'll receive further instructions in paris.

199
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:32,649
Oh, daddy!

200
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:33,749
First class!

201
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:34,816
That is...

202
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,449
Probably what you do for everybody.

203
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:41,682
Okay, well, see ya later.

204
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,649
I hope.

205
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:56,816
Thank you.

206
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,149
Welcome to first class, sir.

207
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,382
May I take your jacket?

208
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:15,982
You want to take my jack...

209
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:18,549
Oh, yes, of course. Yes, sorry about that.

210
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,182
There we go.

211
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,382
Oh, actually, you know what?

212
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,249
If I can just... Gotta get my phone

213
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,048
and writing utensil. Okay.

214
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,015
Lucky pen? Huh?

215
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:36,048
Lucky pen?

216
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:39,915
No, uh, no, just a... Just a regular ol' pen-pen.

217
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:40,948
Okay.

218
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:47,616
I'm chuck, by the way. I mean, charles.

219
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:48,849
I mean, my name is charles,

220
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,416
but my friends call me chuck.

221
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:53,549
I'm hannah. Just hannah, chuck.

222
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,482
Good, that makes it easy.

223
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,649
Nice to meet you.

224
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:56,649
Nice to meet you.

225
00:09:56,716 --> 00:10:00,015
Yeah.

226
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,682
May I offer either of you a drink?

227
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:03,082
Ooh, uh, no. You know what?

228
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,749
I'm on business, but thank you.

229
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:06,349
Me, too. I'll have his.

230
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,948
You know, on second thought, I think I will then.

231
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:11,182
Thank you.

232
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:12,282
Thank you. For you. Uh-huh.

233
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,149
Thank you. Sure.

234
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,516
So what do you think of our fellow passengers

235
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,883
here in first class?

236
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:20,982
I'm thinking

237
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:22,948
syrian dignitaries over there,

238
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:26,382
couple of nuclear physicists,

239
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,215
but that bunch, I don't know about them.

240
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:30,948
That bunch over there? Uh-huh.

241
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,816
Yeah, I'm gonna go with yale fencing team

242
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,215
without a doubt.

243
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,315
Spot-on.

244
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:36,915
Oh, thanks.

245
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:41,716
Now what about you, charles- but-my-friends-call-me-chuck?

246
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:44,282
Uh...

247
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,115
What about-what about me?

248
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:48,948
Um, I'm in retail, very high-end

249
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,449
merchandise at a very prestigious store.

250
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:07,215
What the...?

251
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:09,015
Come on! Get me out of here!

252
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,182
This is not...

253
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,948
Hey, casey.

254
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:14,549
Oh, thank you.

255
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:30,015
See that?

256
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,315
See that? How do you do that?

257
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:32,449
You command respect. I...

258
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,582
No.

259
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,616
I take it.

260
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,282
Shaken, not stirred, sir.

261
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,883
Thank you.

262
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,682
You don't fly first class often?

263
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:53,582
Well, uh...

264
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,883
No, no, of course I do. All the time.

265
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,282
L.A. To paris.

266
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,682
Paris to l.A.

267
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:00,883
What about you?

268
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:04,015
Well, I, uh, I work for a private investor.

269
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:06,215
Essentially, he just flies me around the world,

270
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:08,516
and I fix problems for him, it stuff.

271
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:10,915
Computers, mainframes. It's terribly boring.

272
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:12,749
And stress, a lot of stress.

273
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,816
But I get to travel.

274
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:15,982
And live in paris.

275
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,915
I have a view of the eiffel tower.

276
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:19,282
No way. Really?

277
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:21,549
Yeah. Have you been?

278
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,749
To the eiffel tower? Yeah. So many times.

279
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,048
Can't even count how many times.

280
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:27,783
I know everything there is to know about it.

281
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,048
Mr. Muscles?

282
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:35,749
Let me take a gander.

283
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:37,649
I'm thinking professional wrestler, maybe.

284
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:47,915
I don't know. Tough to tell.

285
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:49,549
Kind of nondescript, really.

286
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:50,649
Don't you think?

287
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:51,948
Would you excuse me for just a second?

288
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:53,282
I got to use the little boys' room.

289
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:54,215
Yeah.

290
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:55,249
I'll be right back.

291
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:56,616
Okay. Okay.

292
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,349
Hey, guys, you there?

293
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,616
Chuck, have you flashed yet?

294
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,182
Yeah. How did you know I'd flash?

295
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,015
Because your mission's not in paris, chuck.

296
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,616
Your mission is on the plane.

297
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,322
What do you mean, my mission is on the plane?

298
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,309
What do you mean, the mission is on the plane?

299
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,242
Hugo panzer, the man you flashed on.

300
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,242
He's a ring agent.

301
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,342
He's moving a cia crypto key to paris.

302
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:24,509
He'll have put it in cargo.

303
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,975
You'll need to get his claim ticket,

304
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:29,309
go to the cargo hold, find his bag, get the key.

305
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,676
Yeah, I'm only seeing problems with that plan right now.

306
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:35,676
Hugo panzer is a bit on the large side.

307
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:37,142
Chuck, I gave you the pen for a reason.

308
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,409
You can do this.

309
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,342
The pen. Of course.

310
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,742
The pen. Tranq him, get the ticket.

311
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:45,142
No problem.

312
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,208
Chuck, please be careful.

313
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:47,808
Hugo panzer is very dangerous.

314
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,342
He is a master at close-quarters combat.

315
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:51,776
Sarah, don't you worry.

316
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:54,108
I will have that key back before they serve the lobster.

317
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:56,676
And by the way, I'm quite looking forward to that.

318
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:58,409
Hello?

319
00:13:58,475 --> 00:13:59,709
You should have told me.

320
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:00,709
And this is why I didn't.

321
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:02,175
Chuck is not ready for paris

322
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,742
and he's certainly not ready for a midair mission.

323
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,575
I mean, we can't even go in and help him.

324
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:08,609
Well, now we find out if your asset is a real spy.

325
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,175
Who are you, agent shaw?

326
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,808
Because, you know, I have never heard of you,

327
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,042
and neither has casey.

328
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:15,375
You're a very well kept secret.

329
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:18,008
I do like my secrets. Don't you?

330
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,609
Being the daughter of a con man

331
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,242
teaches you that.

332
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:22,475
You really do read everybody's files.

333
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,609
Of course.

334
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:24,875
And I have a few questions for you.

335
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:28,375
Seven months ago, when chuck was in prague,

336
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:30,208
you went off grid for three days.

337
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:34,108
This is a surveillance photo of a hotel in lisbon.

338
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:35,275
This is you.

339
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,676
Beckman ordered you to stay in contact,

340
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,875
but you ran. Why?

341
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,342
It's not what you think.

342
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,442
I don't know what to think.

343
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,676
Are you a double agent?

344
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:46,309
A ring operative?

345
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,042
Or is this about chuck?

346
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,841
Excuse me, sir?

347
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,208
Sorry to bother you.

348
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,941
The woman that I'm sitting next to is a bit of a nuisance.

349
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,808
Will not shut up.

350
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,475
So I was kind of wondering if I could plop down here,

351
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:02,676
if that's okay.

352
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:05,875
Fine.

353
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,908
Thanks. Awesome.

354
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,776
Yeah, you know, I think she's an upgrade.

355
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,475
It's such a bummer, too,

356
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,042
because one of the things I love about first class

357
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,008
is the opportunity to really socialize

358
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,841
and rub elbows with people that are, you know, like-minded,

359
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:25,575
and not the rabble. Don't you agree?

360
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,175
Excuse me.

361
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:33,509
Oh, yeah, sure. Do your thing.

362
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,709
Crossword time!

363
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:57,208
One across, "ecru."

364
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,442
It's the air pressure. What? Huh?

365
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,208
Pens don't always work on planes because of the pressure change.

366
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,908
That-that's fascinating. Let me try.

367
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,908
Oh, no, please don't...

368
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,042
Sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry.

369
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,309
That wasn't ink.

370
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,742
Sir, this is first class.

371
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:27,309
Who are you? Nobody.

372
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,776
Who are you?

373
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,609
Kgb.

374
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,609
Yeah? Any updates on chuck?

375
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:00,808
Relax, casey. He's doing fine.

376
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:03,776
Hey, john.

377
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:05,908
Uh, do you have a second?

378
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:08,309
I need a favor.

379
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:10,941
Not interested.

380
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,776
Oh, I hate to pull rank here, uh, john,

381
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:16,808
but I am your superior.

382
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,142
What?

383
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,442
I need you.

384
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,108
Okay, please help me.

385
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,642
I don't know what they'll do next--

386
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,242
Mute lester and his gang.

387
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,676
They've taken over the store.

388
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,142
They set booby traps for me everywhere.

389
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,309
I'm going crazy here.

390
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,941
I can't fight them by myself anymore.

391
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,375
They don't follow any rules.

392
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:36,542
Insurgents?

393
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:39,342
I hate insurgents.

394
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:41,742
Then this will work out, I think.

395
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:18,375
Hey.

396
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,575
Hey, guys.

397
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:21,008
I'm in the cargo hold,

398
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:23,042
and it's friggin' freezing in here.

399
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,275
Good job.

400
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:25,509
Look for the matching ticket,

401
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:27,575
find the key, get back to your seat.

402
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,709
Come on.

403
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,208
I'm right, aren't I?

404
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,375
I should tell you, I'm always right.

405
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:42,609
It's annoying, but true.

406
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:43,941
Why don't you tell me what you're right about

407
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:45,208
so I can tell you that you're wrong?

408
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:48,475
My theory about you and chuck.

409
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,042
Most spies push their assets to perform.

410
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:52,509
That's what I do.

411
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:53,742
You protect him.

412
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:55,108
You care for him.

413
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,575
You followed him to lisbon.

414
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,509
That's not true. Come on.

415
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,742
I was right about this mission, and I'm right about you.

416
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,509
You know, chuck isn't home free yet.

417
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,808
What do you got, chuck? I found it.

418
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,808
It's a casket.

419
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,542
Smart. The ring knows

420
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,275
that customs won't check the body.

421
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:42,509
Open it up.

422
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:44,375
Find the key. That's kind of disgusting.

423
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,142
Get it done, chuck.

424
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,342
Oh!

425
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,342
Hi.

426
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:56,808
Sorry about this.

427
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,676
Where are you? Ooh!

428
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:01,509
Oh, dead hands. Dead, cold hands.

429
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,542
Dead, cold.... Oh.

430
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,142
Here we go.

431
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,175
Ooh, that's disgusting.

432
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,676
Gah! Dead skin, dead skin,

433
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,008
dead skin.

434
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,676
Jackpot.

435
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:24,642
It's chuck.

436
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,409
Don't answer.

437
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,642
He's taken care of hugo. All he has to do is find the key.

438
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:29,875
He shouldn't need to call.

439
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:33,409
Sarah, pick up. Pick up your phone.

440
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:34,375
And what if he's in trouble?

441
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,875
Go ahead, answer it.

442
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:38,575
Just know that if you do, he'll never be a real spy.

443
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,409
And one day, that will get him killed.

444
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,676
Sorry. Sorry, old man.

445
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:51,042
Sorry, old man.

446
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:03,375
Don't freak out.

447
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:18,831
Casey! Casey!

448
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,780
Listen, I'm in a little bit of a pickle right now.

449
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:25,246
I am currently trapped in a coffin

450
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:26,613
with a recently deceased

451
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,680
elderly man and a very large bad guy trying to find me.

452
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,380
Aren't you still on the plane?

453
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:32,980
Right, yes, I forgot to mention that part.

454
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,447
The mission is on the plane.

455
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:35,780
I have the key,

456
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,880
but the ring operative is right outside.

457
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:40,147
What do I do? You get taken.

458
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:41,947
What?!

459
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,914
The ring agent's gonna find you, because you picked

460
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,447
the single dumbest place to hide.

461
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,513
Oh, gee, thanks. Criticism is always welcome.

462
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,147
When he does, you act like your little girlish self.

463
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:52,513
You scream like a banshee, so he doesn't think you're a threat.

464
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,380
When he pulls you out, you find a weapon and then flash.

465
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:57,680
Well, what if I don't flash?

466
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:59,513
Then you're dead-- so flash.

467
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,680
C-casey...

468
00:22:03,914 --> 00:22:05,213
Chuck! Chuck!

469
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,880
Yeah, casey?

470
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,847
Walker, bartowski's in trouble.

471
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,047
The ring operative has him.

472
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:17,346
What? Chuck's been taken.

473
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:20,181
I'm opening a line to his phone.

474
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:25,047
I sincerely hope that that's not your father.

475
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:25,814
Oh!

476
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,380
You should've taken my watch.

477
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,081
My employer demands a certain heart rate

478
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:34,547
when I'm on the job.

479
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:37,413
Got a little present for you.

480
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:45,246
They really are a fencing team.

481
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,313
Why don't you just come here?

482
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,947
I'll do this clean.

483
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:54,114
Easy.

484
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:55,114
No pain.

485
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,447
Please be in the intersect.

486
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:08,847
En garde.

487
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,181
Point. What's the matter with you?

488
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:15,246
You know you're gonna die.

489
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:40,980
You missed.

490
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:42,313
A lot.

491
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:54,047
Chuck, chuck, what's happening?

492
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:55,313
Hey, guys,

493
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,647
I'm still alive,

494
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:59,647
and my first solo mission was a success.

495
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:05,380
Buckle up, buy more-ians, it's gonna be a bumpy ride.

496
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:08,213
Meet my new lieutenant assistant manager, john casey.

497
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,014
You guys know john from appliances.

498
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:14,181
Or maybe you remember him

499
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:15,413
from the volleyball incident

500
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,313
at last year's employee picnic.

501
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,647
Either way, for those of you

502
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,380
who are willing to abandon the plot

503
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:23,014
to sabotage me in my assistant managership,

504
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:24,380
you're free to go.

505
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:30,547
Well, well, well,

506
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:33,014
lookie what we have here.

507
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,014
This is a no-smoking store.

508
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:35,880
Thanks, jeff.

509
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:37,081
Do you know what, my lieutenant

510
00:24:37,147 --> 00:24:38,847
has the right to smoke a cigar if he wants.

511
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,580
Or he can put it out.

512
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,613
Mr. Casey.

513
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:47,947
Anyone else want to leave?

514
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,714
Anything you got to say, big guy?

515
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:57,947
Lester says

516
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:00,246
this... Isn't over.

517
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:01,246
Does he?

518
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,081
And I know it sounds outrageous,

519
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:14,880
but the eiffel tower's most amazing engineering feat

520
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,647
is the elevator itself...

521
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:19,380
And with that, I realize I'm the most boring person

522
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:22,680
in the world. No, no, that was an amazing story.

523
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:25,114
And-and I really like your model.

524
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:26,413
Thanks.

525
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,880
It was a...

526
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:29,647
Gift from my dad.

527
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,413
Can I ask you a personal question?

528
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:36,213
Sure.

529
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,580
Have you ever been to paris, chuck?

530
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:41,747
Of course.

531
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:43,947
That's a...

532
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,780
No, I haven't. It's just that

533
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,947
you talked about it with such wonder,

534
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,280
like someone who's always wanted to go.

535
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:54,780
No one in first class

536
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,014
ever wants to do anything that badly.

537
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,714
You're different; you stand out.

538
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:03,814
Thank you.

539
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,480
This is all kind of new to me.

540
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,680
I think I just wanted to fit in, you know?

541
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:11,213
Why? What's your secret, chuck?

542
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,213
Uh, the truth is, I work at the buy more in burbank.

543
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,114
You know, the...

544
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:20,747
Uh,

545
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,447
in the nerd herd department.

546
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:24,613
I did a home theater install at this guy's house

547
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,880
in l.A., and, uh, he liked it so much

548
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:28,947
that he wanted me to do the same thing

549
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:31,246
in his home in paris.

550
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:33,181
So here I am.

551
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:36,346
His ticket-- I'm just along for the ride.

552
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:39,814
I don't really belong in paris,

553
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,346
or... First class, for that matter.

554
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:44,380
That's not true.

555
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:46,914
Do you want to know my secret?

556
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,380
Is it scary?

557
00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:53,081
No. Um...

558
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,980
I just got fired from my job.

559
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,213
I thought I'd actually convinced them

560
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,081
to let me stay, but...

561
00:27:00,147 --> 00:27:02,513
I am now officially flying to paris

562
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,280
to empty out my office.

563
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:06,047
I'm so sorry.

564
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:08,147
It's okay.

565
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:11,580
Meeting you almost makes it worth it.

566
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,947
Mama?

567
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:40,081
Uh-uh-uh, you're not here,

568
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:41,980
you're still sleeping.

569
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:44,547
You're still in bed.

570
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:46,513
Just relax.

571
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,114
Just watch the red dot.

572
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:54,280
This is your boss.

573
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:57,047
Morgan is your boss.

574
00:27:57,114 --> 00:28:00,014
Morgan is your boss.

575
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,181
Morgan is your boss.

576
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,047
Morgan is my boss.

577
00:28:05,114 --> 00:28:07,914
Morgan is lester's boss.

578
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,647
Morgan is lester's boss.

579
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,346
That's right.

580
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:15,280
You're happy that morgan is your boss.

581
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:16,280
Wait.

582
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:17,980
This morgan person is real?

583
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,081
This store you work in, it actually exists?

584
00:28:20,147 --> 00:28:22,313
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yes to both of those things.

585
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,447
Although, even personally, I have quite often wondered

586
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:27,680
if the buy more was really an insane asylum, but yeah.

587
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,714
What is it?

588
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,513
Uh...

589
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,814
Uh, that-that, uh, that drink, I don't remember... Ordering it.

590
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,147
It just

591
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:43,680
kind of appeared out of nowhere.

592
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:45,880
A-and you drank it.

593
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:50,747
Are you okay?

594
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,313
Yeah.

595
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

596
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:57,680
Just tasted a little... A little funny.

597
00:28:57,747 --> 00:29:00,313
Yeah, you look like you've been poisoned.

598
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:02,955
That's crazy.

599
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:21,801
Chuck? Is something wrong?

600
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:23,302
I've just been poisoned!

601
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:24,536
Someone just poisoned me!

602
00:29:24,602 --> 00:29:26,736
I think it was hugo-- I tied him up downstairs

603
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:28,335
in the cargo hold, but somehow he escaped!

604
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,235
What did it taste like? It was very complex.

605
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,035
It had a strong nose, with hints of apple,

606
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,235
and then a very sour finish.

607
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:34,335
He's right, it's poison.

608
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:35,903
Chuck, you have to throw up.

609
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:37,002
That's disgusting.

610
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,302
Just do it right now.

611
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:40,002
Busy!

612
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:42,335
It's hugo-- he is coming for me.

613
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:44,669
Sir, are you okay?

614
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:46,002
Do you need any help?

615
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,302
Sorry, mexican food.

616
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,335
You do not want to come in here.

617
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,569
Scream, and you're dead.

618
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:53,402
Chuck?

619
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:54,569
I am so writing

620
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:56,369
a letter to the airline about this.

621
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:59,402
Shut up. There's only one antidote for that poison,

622
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:00,869
and I have it.

623
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:03,335
Now, right now, you're feeling queasy.

624
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,502
In an hour, you'll be in more pain

625
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,002
than you could possibly imagine.

626
00:30:07,068 --> 00:30:08,169
Okay, fine. What do you want?

627
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:10,068
The key! Now!

628
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:11,235
What key?

629
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:13,935
Ooh! Oh, th-the key.

630
00:30:14,002 --> 00:30:15,536
You have it; I want it.

631
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:16,736
Give it to me.

632
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:17,935
And don't lie.

633
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:19,269
I'll kill you right here.

634
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:22,102
I have the key, but I don't have it on me-- I hid it

635
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,736
down in the cargo hold.

636
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:29,702
Go on.

637
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:33,736
Oh.

638
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:34,636
Hi.

639
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,035
Ooh!

640
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,035
Isn't poisoning me enough?

641
00:30:41,135 --> 00:30:42,269
Now,

642
00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:43,369
where's the key?

643
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:44,736
Antidote first.

644
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,135
Is this your first mission?

645
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:46,935
Maybe.

646
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:48,968
You led my agent

647
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:51,169
into a mission with two ring operatives?

648
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:53,269
He's going to make it. How?

649
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:54,436
Watch.

650
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:56,803
This is blackbriar to crystal palace.

651
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:57,968
Do you have me, palace?

652
00:30:58,035 --> 00:30:59,402
Copy that. I need to initiate

653
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:00,769
an executive office override.

654
00:31:00,836 --> 00:31:02,636
Put sentry satellite into inverse orbit

655
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:04,302
over millennium atlantic flight 3923.

656
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:05,335
Standing by for 3923...

657
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:07,135
What are you doing?

658
00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:09,669
Four years ago, we launched a satellite

659
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:12,269
designed to take control of enemy fighters.

660
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:14,669
Surprisingly, the thing actually works.

661
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:15,803
You're a pilot, right?

662
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:17,436
You're gonna take control of that plane?

663
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,669
That's a 747.

664
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:21,669
I hope you're a quick learner... Captain walker.

665
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:32,135
Call chuck.

666
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,235
All right, I work for the cia, okay?

667
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:41,269
And that's my boss.

668
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:44,602
I cannot give up the key without his authorization first.

669
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,968
Answer it. On speaker.

670
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:50,935
Hi, guys.

671
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:53,536
If you're wondering, I'm doing just dandy.

672
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:54,536
Aside from being

673
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:55,736
captured, poisoned

674
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:58,102
and repeatedly socked in the gut!

675
00:31:58,169 --> 00:31:59,335
I have your agent.

676
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:01,869
Order him to give me the key. Who is this?

677
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:03,169
I work for a third party,

678
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:05,436
and my employer doesn't tolerate failure.

679
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:08,836
Now, your man...

680
00:32:08,903 --> 00:32:11,636
Oh, chuck. Seat 2b.

681
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:14,569
...chuck here will be dead in an hour.

682
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:16,035
But I'm in a rush,

683
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,169
so he gives me the key

684
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,502
or I kill him now.

685
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,536
Okay.

686
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:22,536
O-okay?

687
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:23,702
Did he just say... Did you just say...?

688
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:25,068
I think you meant to say,

689
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:28,569
"Please don't kill my good friend chuck."

690
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:31,502
What type of poison are you using?

691
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:34,502
I'm not bluffing. This is a cyanide hybrid.

692
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:35,968
Cyanide hybrid!

693
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:38,068
You've used it before in berlin.

694
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:39,636
What?

695
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:42,068
Serena, you used that same poison to take out

696
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:43,669
the syrian ambassador, and I know

697
00:32:43,736 --> 00:32:44,903
you work for the ring.

698
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,903
How do you know this?

699
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,235
Don't worry about that.

700
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,436
Do what I say. Give my agent the antidote,

701
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,502
and I'll let you and your guerillas slide on this one.

702
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,068
Who are you?

703
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:56,068
Serena, you can do this.

704
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:57,235
Let him go.

705
00:32:57,302 --> 00:33:01,235
I can't. You know my employer.

706
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:04,702
Your agent is alone and he's going to die.

707
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:08,068
No, my people are never alone. Now.

708
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,402
Disengaging yaw damper.

709
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:19,235
Inducing negative gs.

710
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,702
We've run into a patch of turbulence.

711
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:36,602
Please return to your seats right now.

712
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:45,436
You shot a gun on a plane?! Are you crazy?!

713
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:09,169
Sarah, level off

714
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:10,803
the plane now! Got it.

715
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:24,302
Ah...

716
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:25,369
Ah!

717
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:37,436
Hey,

718
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:40,369
I'm alive and I have the key.

719
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:44,202
Unfortunately, I did not get to use my nunchakus.

720
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:47,206
This is blackbriar to crystal palace.

721
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:48,272
Disable link on my mark.

722
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:49,272
Copy that.

723
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,005
Three, two, one. Break.

724
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:52,239
Uplink terminated.

725
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,072
Thank you, palace.

726
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:57,373
Well, flight crew will never even know we were there.

727
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:59,773
Just another day in the office.

728
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,406
I do everything I can to protect my people.

729
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:07,673
I lost one spy.

730
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,206
It was my fault.

731
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:11,139
And it will never happen again.

732
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:15,939
Why were you in lisbon?

733
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:22,773
I went to bury bryce, my partner.

734
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,239
He wanted his ashes there.

735
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:28,905
Lisbon was our first mission.

736
00:35:28,972 --> 00:35:30,606
I knew I wasn't supposed to leave,

737
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:36,306
but I promised him that I would take care of it, so I did.

738
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:38,272
If you want me out, just tell beckman

739
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,072
and she will reassign me.

740
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,539
Why would I do that?

741
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,139
I need you.

742
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,406
I just had to be sure

743
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,039
that the ring hadn't gotten to you already.

744
00:35:46,106 --> 00:35:47,306
And now do you believe me?

745
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:49,606
Every word, sarah.

746
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:02,939
How are you feeling?

747
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:05,773
Um, much better, thanks.

748
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,639
Sorry about that whole airsickness episode.

749
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:09,172
It wasn't my finest hour.

750
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,606
No, it's okay.

751
00:36:10,673 --> 00:36:12,673
Chuck, I'm gonna be here for a couple of days

752
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,072
clearing things up.

753
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:17,005
I would love it if I could show off the eiffel tower to you.

754
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:18,806
What do you say?

755
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:20,872
Absolutely. That would be amazing.

756
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:21,939
Great.

757
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,406
Oh.

758
00:36:27,306 --> 00:36:28,506
Hello.

759
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:30,439
Chuck, our paris station is taking over custody

760
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:31,506
of the ring operatives.

761
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:33,272
They send their compliments.

762
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:35,506
Fantastic. That is great news. Another thing,

763
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:38,206
stay on the plane. Need that key back in burbank asap.

764
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,339
Uh...

765
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:43,673
Really? I can't...?

766
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,872
Mission's over, chuck. Time to come home.

767
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:51,306
What is it?

768
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:55,039
Um, the install job I was gonna do here in paris

769
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:58,239
has been canceled, so buy more needs me back immediately.

770
00:36:58,306 --> 00:37:00,005
I have to stay on the plane.

771
00:37:00,072 --> 00:37:01,872
What about paris?

772
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:03,740
Don't worry about it. It's-it's no big deal.

773
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,005
I'll get back here eventually.

774
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:08,039
And, uh, and furthermore, uh...

775
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:14,339
Hannah, if, um, if you ever find yourself in burbank,

776
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:15,840
and I don't know what the chances

777
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:17,272
of you finding yourself in burbank are,

778
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,972
but if you do find yourself in burbank,

779
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,172
and you're still without a job,

780
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,172
my assistant manager owes me

781
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,393
about a million- and-a-half favors.

782
00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:26,093
Although, I have to warn you,

783
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:27,526
you will be terribly overqualified

784
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:28,927
for the job.

785
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:33,063
Thank you.

786
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:34,163
Oh, you're welcome.

787
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:38,067
It was a pleasure to meet you, hannah.

788
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:40,301
It was great to meet you, too, chuck.

789
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,367
Bye.

790
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:44,967
Au revoir.

791
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:23,234
Lester, dude, what are we going to do?

792
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:29,067
About morgan and his new goon?

793
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:30,234
Morgan?

794
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah. How are we gonna get back at him?

795
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:36,934
Morgan grimes is the kindest, warmest, most understanding

796
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,667
human being I've ever known in my life.

797
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,000
Whoa, that is too cool.

798
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,833
How did you do that?

799
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,600
Don't ask. Plausible deniability.

800
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,633
Plausible deniability.

801
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,900
Yeah, of course, of course.

802
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,700
Your key, sir.

803
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:02,100
Very good, chuck. Your first solo mission.

804
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,633
I am impressed.

805
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,034
Well, thank you, but I would be dead if it wasn't for you guys.

806
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,433
All right, who wants to see

807
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,733
to see if this key works?

808
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:20,967
What is it, a weapon?

809
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:22,867
No, it's a lockbox.

810
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:24,867
Belonged to a spy I had inside the ring.

811
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:26,800
It's all of the intel the agent had.

812
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,367
With this we might stand a chance.

813
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:46,167
And one of our best didn't die in vain.

814
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:08,234
What's in the envelope, shaw?

815
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,500
She was killed by a ring agent five years ago.

816
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:32,533
Her name was evelyn shaw.

817
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,767
Eve.

818
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:38,234
We both made the same mistake, sarah.

819
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:40,566
We fell in love with spies.

820
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,433
What's with the looks?

821
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,234
He gave me a raise.

822
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,633
Inflation, buddy. See what happens

823
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,466
when you go away for a two day install?

824
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:14,700
Everything changes.

825
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,234
Ah, I don't know.

826
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:19,334
Sometimes I think everything just stays the same.

827
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:21,301
But maybe that's just me.

828
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:22,934
Chuck, what happened on the install?

829
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,667
Nothing, buddy.

830
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,267
Nothing at all.

831
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,767
Bored now.
