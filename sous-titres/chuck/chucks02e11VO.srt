1
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,469
Sweet wheels.

2
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:15,470
Right back at you, dawg.

3
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,407
Love the smell of

4
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:21,175
day before Christmas
in the morning.

5
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:23,311
There's just nothing
quite like the sweet scent

6
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:25,380
of desperate last-minute
shoppers in the air.

7
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:26,748
You jack our prices up 10%?

8
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:28,007
15.
You snooze, you lose.

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,350
We're going to rob them blind.

10
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:31,019
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

11
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:49,003
Hey, sure is quiet around here.

12
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,939
Bad guys taking
a holiday too?

13
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,841
Not that I mind, by the way,
because the Intersect

14
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,344
could certainly use
some down time as well.

15
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:58,146
Speaking of which, we have
a cover date tomorrow.

16
00:00:58,213 --> 00:00:59,647
Christmas at the Bartowskis.

17
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:02,083
Oh, uh, thanks
for the invitation, Chuck,

18
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,584
but I don't do Christmas.

19
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:07,055
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:09,357
I think you just said
you don't do Christmas?

21
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:11,793
Look, I would rather
not get into it.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,928
But it-it's Christmas!

23
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,964
Look, I'm not buying
the whole Scrooge act, okay.

24
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,732
Underneath
that spy cover

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,867
is a regular person
just like the rest of us.

26
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:21,069
I mean, honestly, how weird

27
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:22,403
could Christmas
have been for you?

28
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,706
Christmas
at the Burton household

29
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:28,142
meant the annual
Salvation Army con job.

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,044
Okay, well, it's, uh...

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,746
okay, you're a little
different than the rest of us.

32
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:34,315
But Christmas at
the Bartowskis means

33
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,818
eggnog, PJs,

34
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,387
a fake gas
fireplace

35
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:42,156
<i>and that's right--
Twilight Zone marathons.</i>

36
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:45,526
I'm not taking no for an answer,
Walker, so prepare

37
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,528
to be heart-warmed.

38
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:54,902
Oh, thank God you're here,
Chuck, thank God.

39
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,771
Anna won't speak to me,
you know, after I balked

40
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,206
at the whole moving in
together thing.

41
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:00,408
She thinks you're immature.

42
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:02,110
Afraid to grow up
and be an adult.

43
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:04,712
Exactly. Yeah, exactly,
and that's ridiculous!

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,582
Do I not look like
an adult to you?

45
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,995
Well, it's been
about a half hour now,

46
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:22,563
and the chase continues
through the Valley.

47
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,132
20 large says this
thing ends with the pigs

48
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,733
making that punk eat lead.
Thoughts?

49
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,201
I say he crashes

50
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,202
and we end up
with a stand-off,

51
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,303
maybe hostages.

52
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:30,371
Never going to happen.

53
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,672
Please, you guys
are amateurs.

54
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,608
This has "beatdown"
written all over it.

55
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,110
Okay, bring it in then.
Bring it in, everybody. Bring it in.

56
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:38,913
Well, it's nice to see everyone's
in the Christmas spirit this morning.

57
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,348
This is how we roll...
- Bartowski!

58
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,383
Door's open in an hour.

59
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,785
Round up the freaks,
have everyone meet me

60
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:45,353
at Santa's village.
Pronto!

61
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:58,766
This is it, people.

62
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,768
D-day.

63
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:01,903
You ready for war?

64
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:04,806
You got what it takes?!

65
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,176
Take a sniff, Grimes!

66
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:09,977
Tell this band of misfits
what you smell.

67
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:12,313
Absolutely, uh, coffee?
Hazelnut, maybe?

68
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:14,148
A... glazed bear claw,

69
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,450
cream-filled
perhaps, sir?

70
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:16,951
I'm not talking
about my breakfast!

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,620
I'm talking about profits!

72
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,055
People are lazy.

73
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:23,424
They'll be looking to purchase
last-minute gifts

74
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:28,229
which is why we raised
our prices 15%.

75
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,231
We're looking at
a record sales day,

76
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,634
long as you people
don't screw it up.

77
00:03:33,702 --> 00:03:36,204
So, don't!

78
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,945
Hey, thank you.

79
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:45,446
Hey, what's going on?

80
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,948
We, uh, we decided
we'd beat the rush

81
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:49,050
and take advantage of the
friends and family discount.

82
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:50,184
Oh, don't worry about
getting me a gift, babe.

83
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:51,152
You already did.

84
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,286
I did?

85
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:53,821
Yeah, I took it upon myself

86
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,056
since you never know
what to get me.

87
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,724
Well, that's great.
What'd I get you?

88
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:59,427
Weekend sky diving trip
with the boys in Crested Butte.

89
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:01,562
10,000 foot free-fall.
- Awesome!

90
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,964
Bartowski! Santa's Village.

91
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,632
Uh, yeah.
Hey, great.

92
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,801
I got to get back to work.
You kids have fun.

93
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:09,070
Great, so, um,
my gift to my fiancé

94
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:10,304
is a ticket to death.

95
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:11,572
Babe, it's completely safe.

96
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,208
Besides, I need
the adrenaline rush,

97
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:15,610
a little sense of danger
in my life.

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,080
What?

99
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,349
Okay, the suspect has just
gotten off the 5 Freeway

100
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,184
and right now is making his way
through Burbank.

101
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:25,386
Oh, man.
The cops looked pissed!

102
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:27,455
I'm so winning the pool.

103
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:29,090
Christmas sucks.

104
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:30,591
Action News reporting,

105
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,627
as police continue
their high-speed chase

106
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:35,863
through downtown Burbank.

107
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,632
If anything, he appears to be

108
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,333
picking up speed in this
residential neighborhood.

109
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,069
Now, folks, we'd like
to warn anyone in the area

110
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,539
this is obviously an
extremely dangerous situation.

111
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:47,074
Wait a minute; it appears the
perpetrator has just...

112
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:48,476
turned off Burbank Boulevard
into a shopping complex.

113
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:51,345
He's not slowing down.
He's not slowing down!

114
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:04,926
Wow, it's unbelievable.

115
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:06,561
We'll continue to keep you
updated...

116
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,098
All right, nobody move!

117
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,900
Pay up, suckers!

118
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:13,634
Hi...

119
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:16,237
Welcome to the Buy More.

120
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,141
And Merry Christmas.

121
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,093
¶ Na-na na-na na-na ¶

122
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,029
¶ Na-na na-na

00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:43,631

127
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:05,813
Not good...

128
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,314
Not good. Oh, boy.

129
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:08,715
Okay, Ned. Just calm down.

130
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,617
Think, think, think.

131
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:12,719
Hi, Hi.

132
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,956
Uh, my name is
Nathan Edward Rhyerson.

133
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:18,325
Uh, people like
to call me Ned.

134
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:21,195
I'm sorry about the entrance.

135
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,497
Could someone please tell me
who's in charge here?

136
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:24,465
Chuck!

137
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,769
Actually, I'm not technically
in charge.

138
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,904
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Chuck.

139
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,941
So, as long as no one gets
brave, no one gets shot,

140
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:34,942
okay?!

141
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,810
Okay.

142
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:41,381
I think we're safe. Yeah.

143
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:44,418
Um, this store has a very
strict "no bravery policy."

144
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:47,454
Okay. Okay.

145
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:51,658
Everyone, uh, get over there
by the Santa's Village.

146
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,293
Now! Come on!

147
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,632
Uh, Chuck?

148
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,067
Where's the security system?

149
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:04,471
It, um... just follow me.

150
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:09,443
Right over here.

151
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,378
Are there any other ways
in and out of the store?

152
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:13,046
Um, yeah.

153
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:14,848
But they're all
locked down because we

154
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,583
technically haven't opened yet.
- Good.

155
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:17,484
Lock it down.

156
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,002
What's going on?

157
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:41,575
Great, I step out of work
one time and I miss all the fun.

158
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:43,744
The suspect's name
is Nathan Rhyerson.

159
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,712
He is a civilian.
No record.

160
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,914
Not even a speeding ticket
in the past ten years.

161
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,883
Well, Nathan picked himself
the wrong place

162
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:52,119
to be naughty
instead of nice.

163
00:07:52,186 --> 00:07:54,288
Now, I get to play with my new
toy I got myself for Christmas.

164
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,490
General, if we go
in guns blazing,

165
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:57,658
Chuck's cover
will be blown.

166
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,359
The guy seems
pretty timid,

167
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,727
not someone the local PD
couldn't handle.

168
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:03,096
What are you saying,
Agent Walker?

169
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:04,531
I'm saying that Chuck has
family and friends in there,

170
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:05,866
and if we blow Chuck's cover,

171
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:08,335
then not only he will
have to go underground,

172
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:10,237
but so will
everyone else.

173
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:12,739
We'll try it Agent Walker's way
first.

174
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:14,741
Slip into the Buy More
from Castle

175
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,043
and see if you can
remove Chuck

176
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,178
without calling attention
to yourselves

177
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:19,680
or the assets.

178
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:20,781
Understood?

179
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,716
Understood.

180
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,985
Are you okay, Major?

181
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:25,719
Hmm?

182
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:30,223
Oh, uh, just paper cuts.

183
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,193
I'm on gift wrap station
right now, General.

184
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,861
It's an electronic store, Major.

185
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,630
Not Basra.

186
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:39,232
Get it under control.

187
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:46,873
This is Maureen Mitsubishi,
KPFW News,

188
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,642
reporting from
the Burbank Buy More,

189
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,977
where some unlucky employees
are spending

190
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:53,180
the day before Christmas
with an armed gunman

191
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,315
instead of their loved ones.

192
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,384
Who's in charge here?

193
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,087
Well, I am, sir.
Al Powell. Burbank PD.

194
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,288
Who are you?

195
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,924
Lieutenant Mauser.
Hostage negotiator, LAPD.

196
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,392
So, what's it look
like in there?

197
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,894
Well, all indications
are everybody is safe.

198
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:10,297
This guy is an amateur.

199
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,799
Good news is that my cousin,
Mike, is the store manager.

200
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,067
And if I know Mike,

201
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,369
he'll have everything
under control.

202
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,070
Hmm.

203
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:24,177
Why today?

204
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,779
You know how much money
I'm losing?

205
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:28,615
All of our shoppers are
going to go to Large Mart.

206
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,250
There, there, big man.
Just eat.

207
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:31,685
It's going to be okay.

208
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:32,886
It is?

209
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,287
Yes, it is.

210
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,289
Every news outlet
is out there.

211
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,924
Any publicity
is good publicity.

212
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:40,160
Yeah.

213
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:43,163
Besides, my cousin,
Big Al, is a cop.

214
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,798
Half of LAPD'll be here.

215
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:47,200
We can get this store back open
for business by lunch, right?

216
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:48,902
Hmm, maybe.

217
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:59,646
Hey... Hey, Ned.
It's Chuck.

218
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,685
That's a terrible
picture of me.

219
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,989
Hey, you can put
your hands down.

220
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:10,490
You know,
the truth is

221
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,826
I'm really not a bad guy
once you get to know me.

222
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:15,929
When you're not crashing your
car into electronics stores

223
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,631
and waving a gun around?

224
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,533
Yeah.

225
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,002
Look, I know it's no excuse,
but I lost my job, man.

226
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,638
All I wanted was to get
a few gifts for my kids

227
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,106
so we could celebrate
Christmas.

228
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:28,508
And the next thing you know,
I'm the next OJ.

229
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,310
What am I going
to do, Chuck?

230
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:32,179
I mean, they're going to put
me in jail, aren't they?

231
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:35,182
No, no, maybe not.

232
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:37,250
Maybe not, you know, uh...

233
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,953
I mean, you haven't
hurt anyone yet, right?

234
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,122
So, maybe if you give up,

235
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,490
they'll work out
some sort of deal.

236
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:44,624
Probation or something.

237
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:47,494
W-Why would they do that?

238
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:54,000
Look, keep this between us,
but... I know some people.

239
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,036
You know, people who
could make all this

240
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,371
go away as long
as you don't do anything stupid.

241
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,573
Like who?

242
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,218
Who's calling?

243
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,754
Uh, that's probably the police.

244
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:15,322
Maybe they want to know
what's happening.

245
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:16,723
I don't want to talk to anyone.

246
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,358
Do you think you
could answer it?

247
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:20,794
Yeah.

248
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,596
Nerd Herd. How can I help you?

249
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,664
This is Lieutenant Mauser. LAPD.

250
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,032
Who am I speaking with?

251
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,301
This is Chuck Bartowski.
Nerd Herd supervisor.

252
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:29,870
All right, Chuck, I'm going
to need to talk to Ned.

253
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:31,671
He wants to talk to you.

254
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:33,006
He doesn't want to talk to you.

255
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:36,143
Okay, then you and I

256
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,812
are going to have to work
through this ourselves.

257
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,680
So tell me, is there
anyone hurt in there?

258
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:41,681
No, nobody's hurt.

259
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,117
Everybody's okay.

260
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,852
Uh, Ned... is it okay
if I call you Ned?

261
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,087
Sure, Ned's fine.
- Okay.

262
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:49,389
Uh, Ned explicitly told me

263
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,525
that he wants
absolutely no trouble.

264
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,860
Tell him to send out a hostage
as a sign of good faith.

265
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,862
He says that you should
send out a hostage

266
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,998
as a sign of good faith.
- Good God, pick me!

267
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,133
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!
Pick me! Pick me!

268
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,501
Pick me...

269
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:05,739
My 86-year-old mother is dying
of a very rare disease.

270
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,908
It's leukoplakia.

271
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:09,576
And she needs me...

272
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:10,911
her bobo.

273
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,081
Uh... okay, fine.

274
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,550
Send him.

275
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:17,517
Oh, thank you...

276
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:18,685
thank you!

277
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:22,556
Thank you. Thank you.

278
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:25,292
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

279
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,193
Thank you.

280
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:30,997
We're sending someone out.

281
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,666
We got one hostage
coming out, folks.

282
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,101
That scoundrel.

283
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,603
I bet Bartowski
worked out a deal.

284
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:39,806
Yeah, Chuck let Emmett go so he
could get better lunch shifts.

285
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,541
That bastard's selling
us down the river,

286
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,109
making a sweetheart deal
for himself.

287
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:44,578
I guess it's prison rules now.

288
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,947
Every man for himself.

289
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,451
Oh, my...

290
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,953
Who's got a phone?
Who's got a phone?

291
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,521
I need to call my lawyer.
I need to call my therapist.

292
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,356
I need to call my mother,
and I need to call my yogi.

293
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,425
Maureen Mitsubishi

294
00:12:58,492 --> 00:12:59,893
continuing to cover the story

295
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:02,095
at the Burbank Buy More,
where it seems a hostage

296
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:04,197
has just been released.

297
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,633
I'm Lieutenant Mauser, LAPD.

298
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:07,934
Who are you?

299
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,136
I'm Assistant Manager
Emmett Milbarge.

300
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:12,272
That's two "T"s, two "M"s.

301
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,407
Tell me, Emmett.
What's going on inside there?

302
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,543
What's going on inside

303
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:18,845
is the greatest sales event
of the season.

304
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,080
That's right.

305
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,848
We have got the best deals
in town

306
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,683
on all your electronic needs.

307
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:25,652
No, no, Emmett,
I meant the perp.

308
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,020
Is he dangerous?

309
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:28,889
Dangerous?

310
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,156
The only thing dangerous

311
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:32,125
is how low we have slashed
our prices.

312
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:34,194
God bless that man.

313
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,129
Uh, so, uh...

314
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,198
Hey, uh, Chuck,

315
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:39,399
where are these people

316
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:41,134
that can get me out of this?

317
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,769
Um...

318
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,309
They're uh, they're closer
than you think.

319
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,579
Can I use the bathroom?

320
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:54,381
I mean, the store
is already locked down,

321
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,216
so I can't really
go anywhere.

322
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:57,550
Yeah.

323
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:58,652
Sure, of course.

324
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,886
All right.

325
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:01,821
Be back in a sec.

326
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,864
It's about time
the cavalry showed up.

327
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,632
So what's the plan?

328
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,935
The plan is to lock you
in the Castle till this is over.

329
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,303
Come on...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa.

330
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,138
What about Ellie and Morgan
and everyone else?

331
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,140
We're instructed to remove you
and only you, Chuck.

332
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,975
There's a team coming
to extract the rest,

333
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:23,343
and they will be
in good hands.

334
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,878
I'm not just going to leave
my sister behind.

335
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,646
There are rules, Chuck,
and we have to follow them.

336
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,348
So let's go...
- I understand that there are rules,

337
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,849
but when it comes
to family and friends,

338
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,818
there's a time to break 'em.
Get in the hatch, Bartowski.

339
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,153
Chuck, you're letting your
emotions cloud your judgment.

340
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,421
I promise nothing bad
will happen to them.

341
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:36,356
Now please, come on.

342
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:39,592
I can't take that chance.
- Chuck, is that you?

343
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,527
John, John.

344
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:45,398
No, no, no, Ned!

345
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:46,700
Chuck, what's going on?

346
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,034
Ned, Ned,

347
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:49,502
please, please, please
don't shoot that gun.

348
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,704
Who are they?
- They're harmless.

349
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,005
They're
harmless, okay?

350
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:53,673
Look, they heard your crash
and they hid.

351
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:54,975
This is my girlfriend, Sarah.
- Hi.

352
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,509
Hi.
- And this is John Casey,

353
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:57,911
who's even more
harmless than she is.

354
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,012
John Casey.

355
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,113
Ned, please,

356
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:01,114
just uncock the gun.

357
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,386
Okay.

358
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:08,121
How do I do that?

359
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,657
'Cause the truth is, I never
used one of these before.

360
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,392
There's probably a button on it,
like a safety or something like that.

361
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,527
Just go ahead and push...
- No, no, no!

362
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:15,962
Oh, my God. Chuck!

363
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:19,649
We have gunfire.

364
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:20,751
I repeat: we hear gunfire.

365
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:21,752
Oh! Oh! Oh!

366
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:22,786
My foot!

367
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,921
I'm so sorry.

368
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,156
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

369
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:27,524
I didn't mean to
shoot you, I promise.

370
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:28,992
We need a SWAT team
down here pronto.

371
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,029
It's okay, everyone.

372
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,663
It was a mistake.

373
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,432
An accidental shooting.

374
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
But Casey is going

375
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,768
to be just fine.

376
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:39,703
You idiot.
You owe me a toe, Bartowski.

377
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:45,442
You're gonna be okay, John.

378
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,944
A lot of people get by
with nine toes.

379
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,048
I'm getting by
fine with eight.

380
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:52,549
How much do you think
a toe is worth to Casey?

381
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,984
Why?

382
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,053
Maybe there's
a finder's fee.

383
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,788
You know, I
survived three wars

384
00:15:57,855 --> 00:16:00,123
without so much as
losing a fingernail

385
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,324
before I met you,
Bartowski.

386
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,326
Look, I'm really sorry
about your toe, John,

387
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:04,895
but I had the situation
under control.

388
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,129
You're the one
who scared him.

389
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,899
You okay?

390
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,534
I'm just scared.

391
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:13,003
I've never been this close
to a gun before.

392
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:14,738
Yeah, me, neither.

393
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,007
You know what?
We'll...

394
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,041
we'll be okay.

395
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,009
We just have to stick together.

396
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,550
Big Mike, Morgan,

397
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,018
Jeff, Lester,
come here.

398
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:30,420
Get over here.

399
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:33,090
I don't know about you guys,
but I've had enough.

400
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:34,558
This guy is dangerous.

401
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,793
We need to take him out
before anyone else gets hurt.

402
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:37,794
He's right.

403
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,229
The store closes at midnight.

404
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,164
We got lots
of merchandise to move.

405
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:42,365
Fellas, I don't know.

406
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:43,333
Time to be a man, Morgan.

407
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:46,269
Yeah, you know, I'll do it.

408
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:47,504
I'm in. I'm in.

409
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,573
So am I.
- Wait. Hold on.

410
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,141
This is a very,
very bad idea, okay?

411
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,542
Ned shot Casey on accident.

412
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,910
He's not trying to hurt anybody.

413
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:55,512
We need to let the police
handle this.

414
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,080
Chuck's right.
Let the cops handle this.

415
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,716
I know you guys work
at a Buy More, but I'm a doctor.

416
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,384
Okay, I
take risks

417
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:02,552
every day.

418
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,187
This is a matter
of life or death.

419
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,056
Someone needs to man up
and take action.

420
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,024
Someone needs to be a hero.

421
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,193
No, they don't, Devon.

422
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:11,628
Being a hero
is being alive

423
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,230
to take care of your
friends and family.

424
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:16,199
Chuck.

425
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,068
Chuck, they keep calling.

426
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,369
You better answer it.

427
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:20,270
Yeah, coming right now.

428
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:21,438
Don't do anything.

429
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,440
Do nothing.
I will be right back.

430
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,009
Hey, hey,

431
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,544
I, uh... I feel terrible

432
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,379
about shooting
your friend's toe off.

433
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:30,914
No, no, no, no, that's okay.

434
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:33,550
Sometimes, I feel
like shooting him myself.

435
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:34,885
This is Chuck.

436
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:36,119
Okay, okay, talk to me, Chuck.

437
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:37,120
We heard gunfire.

438
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:38,121
What's going on in there?

439
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,122
Everything's under control.

440
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,957
Everything is-is just fine.

441
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,126
There was an
accidental shot fired

442
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,162
and someone lost the majority
of their toe,

443
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:46,530
but besides that,
everything's okay.

444
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:47,631
<i>Put him on the phone.</i>

445
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:49,199
I want to talk to him now.

446
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,034
He wants to talk to you.
- Huh?

447
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,602
Well, ask him what he wants.

448
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,970
I want to know
what his demands are.

449
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:55,305
He wants to know
what your demands are.

450
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,007
Well, I don't know.

451
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:59,309
Uh, I have to think about it.

452
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,811
Can you call back
in, like, five minutes?

453
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:04,681
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,222
So, uh... so what
are you gonna do, Ned?

455
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,859
Well, maybe I should
call my wife.

456
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,295
She always knows what to do
in these situations.

457
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,863
Yeah, that-that's a great idea.

458
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,898
Maybe you could let
everyone else make a call, too,

459
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:22,899
check in with
their loved ones,

460
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:23,934
let them know that they're safe.

461
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,239
Okay, Chuck.

462
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,674
Yeah.

463
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,853
Hey, honey, it's me.

464
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,723
Uh... well, I'm okay.

465
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,626
Look, uh, I know this
is gonna sound bad...

466
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,596
Hey, Mom and Dad.

467
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:53,964
Hi, guys.

468
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,733
Yeah, everything
is awesome.

469
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,469
Well, not really,
but we'll be okay.

470
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,843
Hi, there. You've
reached the Love Chat Line.

471
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:08,645
Looking to chat
with someone special?

472
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,146
Press 1.

473
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,984
Lompoc Correctional Institute.

474
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:18,722
Yes, I'd like to speak
to prisoner 27318,

475
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,657
aka Mom.

476
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:26,630
Hey, baby.

477
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,331
Save your breath, Morgan.

478
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,867
Hey, Big Mike.

479
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,936
How you holding up
in there, partner?

480
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,472
Surviving, partner.

481
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,140
Any shoppers lining up
out there?

482
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,943
Mother?

483
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:41,411
Johnny Boy.

484
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,116
Yeah, I'm okay, uh...

485
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,233
Hi, Chuck.

486
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,467
Where are you?

487
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:05,669
DVDs.

488
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,637
I'm in the romantic comedy
section,

489
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,072
although, for irony's sake,

490
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,641
I suppose I should probably be
in hostage thrillers.

491
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:20,483
So, uh, Ned let everyone
call their loved ones.

492
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,552
That was pretty smart
to call me.

493
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,920
Protect our cover.

494
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:26,356
Yeah, well,
you are my girlfriend.

495
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,490
Sort of.

496
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:33,430
So, does that mean your offer
still stands for Christmas?

497
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:37,033
See, I knew you
could be heart-warmed.

498
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:40,036
I actually, um...

499
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,473
I have something
for you.

500
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,842
I was gonna give it
to you tomorrow,

501
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,010
but considering
the circumstances,

502
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,945
I kind of want
to give it to you today.

503
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,714
Chuck, we're gonna
get out of here.

504
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:53,783
We'll be fine,
I... promise.

505
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:00,790
Wow.

506
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:02,659
It's beautiful.

507
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:05,328
It's good luck.

508
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,430
It was my mom's charm bracelet.

509
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:12,068
My dad gave it to her
when Ellie was born.

510
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:16,072
Oh, Chuck, I can't take this.

511
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,607
This is something real,

512
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,142
something that you should give
to a real girlfriend.

513
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:24,581
I know.

514
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:30,987
Chuck.

515
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:32,856
Duty calls.

516
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:42,699
Hey, this is Chuck.

517
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,501
Chuck, what does he want?

518
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,035
This is Lieutenant Mauser.

519
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:47,637
He wants to know
what you want.

520
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,773
I want to go home and spend
Christmas with my family.

521
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:01,351
All right. Tell him
I'm coming in, Chuck.

522
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,352
I'm unarmed.

523
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,820
I just want to talk

524
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:07,056
so we can get him and everybody
else home for Christmas.

525
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:08,091
Okay.

526
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,893
Okay, all right, yeah,

527
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,661
I'm-I'm gonna come open the door
right now.

528
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:27,544
I'm completely unarmed, Ned.

529
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:30,580
Just want a little face time
so we can talk this out.

530
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,315
Chuck, you come back over here.

531
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:41,291
Okay,

532
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:42,625
I don't want to go to jail.

533
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:45,528
It's okay.
We're gonna work on that.

534
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:47,330
But in the meantime,
what do you say

535
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:49,532
you and I make a trade, okay?

536
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,668
Me

537
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:53,803
for two of your hostages.

538
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:56,473
It'd make a lot
of people out there

539
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,107
feel a whole lot easier.

540
00:22:58,175 --> 00:22:59,309
Yeah,

541
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:00,443
in here, too.

542
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,383
Okay,

543
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:08,585
okay,

544
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:09,819
two people can go.

545
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,321
Okay, good, good.

546
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:14,524
Um, what do you say we start
with the injured man?

547
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,693
He looks like he needs
medical attention.

548
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,360
I'm fine.

549
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:19,329
Good. Let Ellie go.

550
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:20,597
No, no, Casey,

551
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,131
thank you,
but you need to go.

552
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,633
Your toe could
be infected.

553
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:24,834
Chuck,

554
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,903
you've been a good friend to me,

555
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:29,539
so I'm gonna return the favor.

556
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:30,406
I'm gonna let
your girlfriend go.

557
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:32,842
No!

558
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:35,912
Chuck?

559
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,249
Ouch.
- Yikes.

560
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:40,817
It'll be a cold
Christmas

561
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:42,385
at the Bartowskis.

562
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:43,486
Oh, no, he didn't.

563
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,589
I didn't. I don't...

564
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,425
I don't mean I don't want
my girlfriend to leave

565
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:52,495
because clearly,
I would really like for Sarah

566
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,130
to leave and be
out of harm's way.

567
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:55,298
That's not what
I'm saying.

568
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,066
What I'm saying...
what I'm saying

569
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:58,735
is that...

570
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,909
I'm not your only friend here,

571
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:07,343
Ned,

572
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:08,444
you've endeared yourself

573
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:09,546
into the hearts
of everyone here.

574
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:10,580
I think we're all friends.

575
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:11,981
This is a... we're a family.

576
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,383
We've gonna through a lot,
haven't we?

577
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,751
So we should all leave.
Why don't we all leave together?

578
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,088
No, just those two.

579
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:19,956
Okay!

580
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,727
Our team just arrived.

581
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,596
Don't do anything stupid.

582
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,731
Maybe the rest of us
can get out of here

583
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,632
without losing
an appendage.

584
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,469
Uh, Chuck, it's okay.

585
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:38,575
Trust me.
I'll never let anyone hurt you.

586
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:39,776
Okay.

587
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:02,732
Good to finally meet you
face-to-face, Chuck.

588
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,867
Yeah.
- Did a hell of a job.

589
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:07,270
Pretty impressive
for a retail jockey.

590
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:11,574
I just want all this over
as soon as possible.

591
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,309
So do I, Chuck.

592
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,777
So do I.

593
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:25,688
Hey,

594
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,690
don't worry about it, buddy.
I'm a pro.

595
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:30,193
Everything's gonna
be just fine,

596
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,527
okay?

597
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:40,517
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

598
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:43,553
Chuck, look,
you did a good job,

599
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:45,088
but I'll take it from here,
okay?

600
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:46,256
Yeah, but-but you know what?

601
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:47,524
Um, Ned is really uptight,

602
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:49,226
so maybe, maybe I should go
over there

603
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,461
and talk to him and tell him
that you're taking over.

604
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:52,462
Kind of put him
at ease

605
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,830
so he doesn't
get upset.

606
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:55,098
So you guys developed
a little trust, did you?

607
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,266
Yeah.

608
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:59,569
Okay. Oh, yeah, good idea.

609
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:01,371
Good.

610
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:08,645
Listen to me, Ned,

611
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:09,746
you have to listen to me
very carefully.

612
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:10,881
This guy Mauser-- he is no good.

613
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:12,149
He is not a good guy, okay?

614
00:26:12,216 --> 00:26:14,151
We cannot trust him.
- Why not?

615
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:15,752
We have to let everybody
out of the store right now.

616
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,521
If I let everyone out,

617
00:26:17,588 --> 00:26:19,289
then I'm not gonna have
any bargaining chips.

618
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:21,591
I can't go
to jail, Chuck.

619
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,095
Okay, look, the people
I was talking about--

620
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:27,097
the people that can help, they
work for the government, see?

621
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:28,665
They will do anything
they can to protect me.

622
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,401
That's the only bargaining
chip that you need.

623
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:32,869
Ned, you have to trust me.

624
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:34,137
You need to let everyone go.

625
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:35,639
I haven't let you down yet,
have I?

626
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:40,010
Thanks, Chuck.
I'll take it from here.

627
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:41,978
Okay, okay.

628
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,086
Well, Ned...

629
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:51,254
it's time the rubber
hits the road.

630
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:53,023
What do you say
we make a deal?

631
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:56,993
Hmm?

632
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,102
Hey, no, look, no, no,
that's okay; that's okay.

633
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,970
You need medical attention,
Major Casey.

634
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:08,238
No, I'm fine. Let's end this.

635
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:09,406
How's it look in there?

636
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:10,574
Better. Ned seemed
to calm down

637
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:12,342
after he talked
to his wife.

638
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,479
Yeah, where is she?
You didn't bring her down here.

639
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,614
Wife? What wife? There's no
record of Ned being married.

640
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:26,389
He's right. There's no record
of him being married.

641
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:28,592
We saw him make a call.

642
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,461
Trace it. See if we can find out
who he was speaking to.

643
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,801
Look, boys,

644
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:39,703
this guy is tired and frazzled.

645
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,605
I say we take him out.

646
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:42,906
Anyone else play ball
in college?

647
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:44,508
Played some linebacker.
- I did not.

648
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,376
I did a lot of Madden on the
PlayStation 3. Does that count?

649
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:47,777
Be bold, Morgan.

650
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,848
All right, I'm in.

651
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:55,118
All right. Listen up.
It's called "The Picket Fence."

652
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:57,254
Big Mike and I will be
the flanks, all right?

653
00:27:57,321 --> 00:27:59,356
Morgan, you're
the sacrificial lamb.

654
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:00,257
Jeff, Lester,

655
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:01,391
you're coming up from behind.

656
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:02,826
Why are we always
coming up from behind?

657
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:03,894
It seems awkward.

658
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:04,928
I need everybody...

659
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,596
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

660
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:08,231
Well, we're taking
this guy out.

661
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:09,399
You in?

662
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:10,901
No, and neither are you.
This situation

663
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:12,802
is way too dangerous.

664
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,904
Please, Devon,

665
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:15,539
if you love Ellie,

666
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,474
don't do this.

667
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:25,015
Okay, Chuck, you win.

668
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:27,751
Chuck, can I talk

669
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:28,552
to you a minute?

670
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:32,889
Remember: don't be awesome.

671
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,595
Hey.

672
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:39,863
Well, Chuck, it looks

673
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,898
like Ned and I have worked
the whole thing out.

674
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:43,333
That's great! That's great!

675
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:45,302
I'll just go tell everybody
that we can leave.

676
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,671
No, no, no, no,
not just yet, but soon.

677
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:50,473
First, you and I need to work
something out on our own.

678
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,676
I don't understand.

679
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:55,312
You see, FULCRUM knows
John Casey's NSA.

680
00:28:57,782 --> 00:29:01,651
The person he called
is in the Buy More right now.

681
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,653
The yogurt girl's CIA.

682
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:07,123
Oh, my God. Chuck.

683
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:08,925
We've lost enough agents
to these two.

684
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:10,193
We knew they were here
protecting someone.

685
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,228
We just didn't know who.

686
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:13,463
So we caused
a little ruckus,

687
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:17,267
sent Ned inside to see
who they would rush to protect.

688
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:20,770
Turns out...
they're protecting you.

689
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:26,142
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Lieutenant.

690
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,912
Do you see, uh, Ned over there?

691
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,750
I'd hate to see him shoot
your pretty little sister

692
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:35,518
if he thought you were
not cooperating with me.

693
00:29:39,757 --> 00:29:41,491
Look, I'm, I'm just an analyst,
okay?

694
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,026
Please don't hurt anyone.

695
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:44,894
Chuck, you're way more
than just an analyst.

696
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:47,097
We did a background
check on you.

697
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:49,199
Turns out you were
college roommates

698
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:50,567
with Bryce Larkin.

699
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:51,835
The same Bryce Larkin

700
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:53,937
that stole the Intersect
from us.

701
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:55,405
Bryce Larkin is dead.

702
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:58,241
And I'm done negotiating.

703
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,144
Wait.

704
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:03,513
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop him. Stop him.

705
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:05,282
Please stop him.

706
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:09,419
What do you want?

707
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:12,222
I want to know where Bryce
Larkin and the Intersect is.

708
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,559
And if I think you're lying
even a little bit,

709
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:18,128
your sister dies.

710
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:23,033
Where's Bryce Larkin?

711
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:29,406
I don't know.

712
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:31,308
Then I'm really sorry.

713
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,476
But I know where
the Intersect is.

714
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,045
Where?

715
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:44,354
It's right here.

716
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:57,775
All right, Chuck,
this is how it's gonna play out.

717
00:30:57,843 --> 00:31:01,612
Ned's gonna release
another hostage: you.

718
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,247
Then you and I
are gonna go out

719
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:05,116
and get into an ambulance,
which will take you

720
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:08,286
to a secure FULCRUM facility,
where you'll stay.

721
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:15,393
I'm never gonna see
my sister again, am I?

722
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,795
No.

723
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:21,866
Well, then would you mind

724
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:23,501
if I said good-bye to her,
please?

725
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:27,805
Okay.

726
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:31,642
But if you say or do anything
to call attention

727
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,047
to me or your situation,
Ned's gonna shoot her,

728
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:37,882
<i>capisce?</i>

729
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,417
Yeah.

730
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:44,922
Okay, good.

731
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,823
Go ahead.

732
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:57,235
They're letting me go.

733
00:31:57,302 --> 00:31:59,303
Oh, thank God.

734
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:03,007
Good-bye, Ellie.

735
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:05,543
You know how much I love you,
right?

736
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:09,147
Hey! Hey, cheer up.
It'll be okay.

737
00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:10,915
You're acting like you're
never going to see me again.

738
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:12,750
It's okay.

739
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:14,519
See you in a bit, Chuck.

740
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:16,721
Listen, there's a time
to be brave

741
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:18,956
and a time to be timid.

742
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:21,225
This is a time to be brave.
Do it.

743
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:24,162
Right on, bro.

744
00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:28,566
Sir! Sir, over here!
Can we get a statement, sir?

745
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,941
Maureen Mitsubishi

746
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:39,277
back at the Buy More where,
apparently, another hostage

747
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:41,679
has just been released.

748
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:44,248
We're not sure of his identity,
but he does appear

749
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:46,450
to be unharmed.

750
00:32:46,518 --> 00:32:48,019
FULCRUM's got Chuck.

751
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,720
Everybody ready?

752
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:50,755
Yeah.

753
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,123
Hands in.

754
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:53,824
Break.

755
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,030
I hope they're not
doing anything risky.

756
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:00,831
Morgan's with them.

757
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,234
Trust me. You've got
nothing to worry about.

758
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:03,861
They're getting away with Chuck.

759
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,174
Hey, get back here!

760
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:26,851
He's breathing.

761
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:29,453
He's fine. That was
really stupid, Devon.

762
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:30,521
At least he's
not afraid

763
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:33,057
to take a risk like Morgan.

764
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,459
Finally,
this is getting interesting.

765
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:38,796
Okay, who's next?

766
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:42,433
You?

767
00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:58,616
What the...?

768
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,926
Oh!

769
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:14,365
Man, did you see that?

770
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:15,900
Lester?

771
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,469
Are you okay?

772
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:21,038
That was so brave.

773
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:26,777
Well, in times of crisis,
a man...

774
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:28,412
needs to step up.

775
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,015
You know, be a man,

776
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,650
I think they say.

777
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:05,383
Lieutenant Mauser's FULCRUM.
So's Ned... it was all a set-up.

778
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:06,684
I know.

779
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:08,252
Everyone in the store
is still in danger.

780
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,820
Our team is moving in on them
right now; they'll be fine.

781
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,489
Now I need you
to run back as fast as you can

782
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:12,656
to the Castle.

783
00:36:12,724 --> 00:36:14,158
I can't leave you alone
with this guy.

784
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:15,526
Your safety is more important
than mine.

785
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:18,562
Now leave and don't
turn back. Go.

786
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,731
Go.

787
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,931
You may have beaten me,
Agent Walker,

788
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:30,134
but FULCRUM's won.

789
00:37:30,202 --> 00:37:33,704
I know Chuck Bartowski's
the Intersect.

790
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:35,539
Chuck's secret is safe.

791
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:37,975
And you're going straight
to a CIA detention facility,

792
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,443
never to be seen
or heard from again.

793
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:44,281
You go right ahead,
Agent Walker.

794
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:48,285
Arrest me.

795
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,221
But say "good-bye"
to Chuck.

796
00:37:50,288 --> 00:37:53,724
I'm not like those
other FULCRUM agents.

797
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,494
They'll do whatever
it takes to find me.

798
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:57,795
And when they do,

799
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:00,731
every FULCRUM agent we have

800
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:02,466
is going to know
Chuck's the Intersect.

801
00:38:05,937 --> 00:38:07,738
It's going to be the end
of his pathetic existence.

802
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:15,312
So take me in,
Agent Walker.

803
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,814
Ready to go.

804
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:34,932
Oh, God...

805
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:40,909
Hey, how are you doing?
- Okay.

806
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:43,412
I thought I was about
to lose you there for a minute.

807
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,980
It was hell,
but I survived.

808
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,748
Hey, you hungry?
- I could eat.

809
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,427
Ellie.

810
00:39:58,494 --> 00:39:59,862
I thought you'd like to know

811
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,330
that I cancelled
my skydiving trip.

812
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:02,564
Are you sure?

813
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:04,132
I thought you needed
more excitement.

814
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,601
I've had all the excitement
I need, honey.

815
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:15,677
Thanks.
- For what?

816
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:17,346
Staying with me.

817
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:18,614
I would've been
alone tonight.

818
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:20,515
Hmm, me, too.

819
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,289
Anna?

820
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,697
Gross!

821
00:40:49,145 --> 00:40:51,013
Chuck!

822
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:57,152
It's okay.

823
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,520
You're safe.

824
00:40:58,588 --> 00:40:59,755
I got the FULCRUM agent.

825
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:01,957
What happened to him?

826
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,258
I arrested him.

827
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:04,693
Casey's taking him
to a secure facility

828
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:06,595
as we speak.

829
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,766
It's okay.
He's going to go to jail.

830
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,034
He'll never bother you again.

831
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,039
Merry Christmas, guys.
- Merry Christmas.

832
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:18,774
Merry Christmas.

833
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:20,375
Merry Christmas, Chuck.

834
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:23,045
It's not going to be one
we're going to forget soon, huh?

835
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,814
Uh, yeah.
- Oh, that looks fantastic on you.

836
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:27,316
Oh, thank you.

837
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:28,884
I'm so glad
that you have it.

838
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:30,152
Yeah, me, too.

839
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:52,741
Let me ask you something.

840
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:54,876
What do you do when
you see your girlfriend

841
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:56,545
do something
so horrific,

842
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:59,548
it's permanently burned
into your brain?

843
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,250
I don't know, buddy.

844
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:07,522
But I know
exactly what you mean.

845
