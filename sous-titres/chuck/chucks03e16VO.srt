1
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:07,866
Camp security coordinator.

2
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:09,633
Devon? Oh, baby,
you're burning up.

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,534
Justin!

4
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:13,633
They just left.

5
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:15,834
I took care of the husband
and made it look like malaria.

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:17,766
She doesn't suspect a thing.

7
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,833
Guys, we got
to get this place fixed up

8
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:20,099
before Devon and Ellie get back.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,133
Well, actually, I was going
to start with our place.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,367
That is, if your offer for me
to move in still stands.

11
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:28,334
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:35,132
It's official.

13
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,033
There is absolutely
nothing on TV.

14
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,701
Yeah. Monday nights can be
a bit of a wasteland.

15
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:43,534
President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia
arrived in Los Angeles today.

16
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,499
On his agenda
are diplomatic meetings

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,033
and a performance of Beethoven

18
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:49,133
tomorrow night by
The LA City Symphony.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,100
Ugh, sounds like Beckman.

20
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,900
Hey. Jackpot!

21
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,767
Oh, no, no, no. You've made me
watch this before.

22
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,299
This is ridiculous.

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,400
Sarah, please.
You could learn a lot

24
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:01,700
from spies like these.

25
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:02,967
Are you kidding me?

26
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:04,666
Look at these people.

27
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,767
They're breaking about 17
different rules of protocol!

28
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,399
Sweetheart,

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm not actually implying
that you could learn anything

30
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,467
about being a spy from
Chevy Chase or Dan Aykroyd.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,266
I was just simply making a joke.

32
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,099
You remember?
Jokes?

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,967
Taking a girl out, you know,
and buying her dinner,

34
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:20,868
and then she won't
put out for you.

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,601
I love you.

36
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,499
Sorry. I must have
fallen asleep.

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,734
Chuck.

38
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:00,734
I love you.

39
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:05,968
Oh, Sarah, it feels so good
to finally hear you say that.

40
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,234
Sarah, look outside, quick.

41
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,166
Finally.

42
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,566
I'm so hungry.

43
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:17,967
Isn't it great
we found a place

44
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,866
that delivers Zamibian food?

45
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,767
Zamibian food?

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,866
Hello, Chuck.

47
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,767
Shaw?

48
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:52,533
Oh, what?

49
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:54,500
Did you have
another bad dream?

50
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,900
It was, it was
about Beethoven...

51
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,801
and Zamibia...

52
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,366
Chuck, I'm worried about you.

53
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,434
Every time you fall asleep,
you have a horrible nightmare.

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,001
But this one was trying
to tell me something.

55
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:09,634
Tell you what?

56
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,033
General, the Ring
is going to try

57
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,566
and kill
the president of Zamibia

58
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,834
at the Beethoven concert
tomorrow night!

59
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,200
Tomorrow night?

60
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:18,766
We could have done
this in the morning?

61
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,901
You know how dear my sleep
is to me, Bartowski.

62
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,132
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Casey

63
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,167
and General. I-I know
that it's very late,

64
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,133
and you are
obviously very...

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,733
...busy. Um...

66
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:32,399
But the president of Zamibia
is in danger.

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,300
Did you flash
on something, Chuck?

68
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:36,132
I...

69
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,033
Mm...

70
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,700
I know it
because of my dream.

71
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:43,400
Your...
Your dream?

72
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,499
I've been having these

73
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,766
very, very vivid dreams, okay?

74
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,132
First, I saw the news report

75
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,900
on Kuti, the president
of Zamibia,

76
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,533
but then in my dream,
I saw Beethoven.

77
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,901
And then Shaw was there, and he
was delivering Zamibian food.

78
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:53,967
And then he tried
to kill everyone!

79
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,800
So, obviously,
the Zamibian president

80
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,199
is going to be assassinated

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,250
by the Ring
at the Beethoven concert.

82
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,300
General,
permission to slap Bartowski?

83
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:03,900
He had a bad dream.

84
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,133
General, Chuck has been
under a lot of stress lately

85
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,199
with these dreams, and-

86
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,232
No, Walker.

87
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,434
I think I understand
the situation.

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,068
And, to be honest,
it makes perfect sense.

89
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,233
Thank you.
Thank you, General.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,633
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

91
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,166
What are we going to do, huh?
What's our assignment?

92
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,834
Chuck, I'm assigning you

93
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,266
to see a CIA therapist.

94
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,967
These dreams you're having

95
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:25,800
are getting
in the way of your work,

96
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,033
and our sleep.

97
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,167
No, no, no, no. This is crazy.
A therapist?

98
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,466
I don't need a therapist, okay?

99
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,333
Therapists are for people
who have real problems.

100
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm fine.

101
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:37,267
<i>Are you comfortable, Chuck?</i>

102
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,633
No, no,

103
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:40,534
not particularly. No.

104
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,000
How does this work,
exactly?

105
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,399
I've only seen
what you see in movies

106
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
and stuff like that.

107
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,433
Do you ask me questions?

108
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:48,734
And I just answer? Or is it
like a word association thing?

109
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,000
So, you would, like,
say "father" and-

110
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,100
Actually, no, no, no.
Give me another word.

111
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,467
Do you want to talk about
your father, Chuck?

112
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,001
This wasn't my idea,
you know.

113
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:03,233
So, no, I don't really
want to talk about anything,

114
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,200
to be perfectly honest.

115
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,334
Despite your sparkling
conversation skill.

116
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:13,466
That was, that was a joke.

117
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:14,633
I was just...

118
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,767
Just going to town on
that pad, aren't you?

119
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,934
Just a little joke.
Okay, fine. I'll talk.

120
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,933
Where do I start?
Uh...

121
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,601
Okay, well, my girlfriend
just moved in with me.

122
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,000
Best part of my life.

123
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,167
Really rock-solid relationship.

124
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,133
Not a problem there.

125
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,199
You know, she's
a little distant.

126
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,499
She could be more
communicative, though.

127
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,900
But she doesn't exactly say,
"I love you" back.

128
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,232
I've never really
done this before, you know?

129
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,600
Even though I know
that she loves me,

130
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm just, you know,
just kind of noting it.

131
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:39,600
Because I know.
I know that she loves me.

132
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:41,199
And I know that.

133
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,100
Do you?

134
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,300
Let's get back
to your dreams.

135
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,100
It's my belief that they are
a product of your subconscious

136
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,067
interacting with the Intersect.

137
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,299
Wait, what?

138
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,300
How...

139
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,901
You know about the Intersect?

140
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:04,034
I'm a CIA psychiatrist.

141
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,068
I know everything
about you, Chuck.

142
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,666
And as far as the
Intersect goes,

143
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,766
we've known for some time

144
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,068
that it could spur
a host of side effects.

145
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,633
Like dry scalp?

146
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:17,034
Because I have had
annoyingly dry scalp since...

147
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,601
The Intersect is
extraordinarily powerful.

148
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,867
It has the
potential to...

149
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:24,133
overwhelm your mind.

150
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,500
With an end result akin
to something much like...

151
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,701
insanity.

152
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:30,967
Insanity?

153
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:34,334
Doc, I'm not insane.

154
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,766
And you're not
sure about that.

155
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,734
So, it could just be that
the Intersect is doing its thing

156
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,166
while I'm sleeping.

157
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,300
<i>And if that's true, then
President Kuti is in danger.</i>

158
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,800
Slow down, Chuck.

159
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,767
Something is going to happen
at the concert tonight, okay?

160
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,700
And if I'm there,
we-we could stop it

161
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,099
And then I'm not crazy, right?

162
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,034
I'm sorry, Chuck,
but I can't let you do that.

163
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,200
Until further notice,

164
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,367
I'm removing you
from field duty.

165
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:03,020
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

166
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,633
There he is.

167
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,401
Welcome home, pal.

168
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,100
It's good
to be home.

169
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,366
Hey, look at you. All right.
You know what?

170
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,701
I'd say malaria aside,
you look pretty...

171
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:54,766
awesome.

172
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,366
I actually feel
pretty great.

173
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,167
I'm ready to get
back out there.

174
00:07:58,168 --> 00:07:59,700
I had an important realization.

175
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,601
That looks don't
get you everywhere?

176
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,966
No, Morgan.

177
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,734
You can die just as easily
from a mosquito in Africa

178
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,433
as you can
from a spy in Burbank.

179
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:10,466
This is what I'm talking about.

180
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,800
Listen. Fear is
the mind killer.

181
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,584
Yeah.

182
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,299
Right.

183
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,599
You can't live scared, bro.

184
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,200
Not for yourself,
not for anyone.

185
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,567
I think it's jammed a
little bit, or something.

186
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,367
This one's broken.

187
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,267
Oh. Hey.
Ah, Ellie.

188
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,267
I heard Devon has malaria.

189
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,399
Yeah.

190
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,399
Nasty stuff.

191
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,834
Had it four,
maybe five times myself.

192
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,801
Tough to say.

193
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,633
Uh, you know, those meds
aren't going to help him.

194
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:45,767
What he needs are
African snake herbs.

195
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,232
I might have some
back at my place.

196
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,134
I will keep that in mind, John.

197
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,833
Thank you.

198
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,167
Okay.

199
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,599
Crazy.

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,500
<i>You're not crazy.</i>

201
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,233
Don't freak out.

202
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
Chuck, you in there?

203
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,601
Come in.

204
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,067
Hey.
Hey.

205
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:11,232
How was the doctor's?

206
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,867
Uh, good.
Great, actually.

207
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,834
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
What about you?

208
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,332
You hear anything
from Beckman

209
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,000
about anything?

210
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:22,001
Chuck, I know I'm your partner,
but I'm also your girlfriend.

211
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,567
And you can tell
me anything.

212
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,666
I know that.

213
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,433
Of course I-
Of course I know that.

214
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:32,367
Honestly.
Hey, I'm fine, okay?

215
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:36,134
Just a solid good night's rest,
and I'm right as rain.

216
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,500
Which I don't
totally understand

217
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:41,168
'cause rain is
kind of all over the place.

218
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,867
Glad you're okay.
Thanks.

219
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,034
<i>Nothing like absorbing
a little local culture.</i>

220
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:57,034
President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia
will be in town today.

221
00:09:57,101 --> 00:10:00,233
The tiny African nation
seeks to improve its

222
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,033
rocky diplomatic relations...
Okay, Chuck.

223
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,900
You're watching more
cable television

224
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:05,100
than is healthy
for a young man.

225
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,034
Please talk to me.
What's going on?

226
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:10,567
Buddy, I've been having the
strangest and most vivid dreams

227
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:11,766
that I've ever had
in my life.

228
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,100
How vivid are we
talking about here?

229
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,667
Well, they have
to do with that guy.

230
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,834
I guess he's kind of handsome in
an an authoritative kind of way.

231
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:20,933
I don't know what
you're talking about.

232
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, me, neither.

233
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,299
But he's the
president of Zamibia,

234
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,533
and he's going to be at
the symphony tonight.

235
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:25,966
And the dream that I had
made me think that...

236
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,101
<i>Made me know that
he's in danger, man.</i>

237
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,533
But Beckman sent
me to some doctor

238
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,833
who thinks that it's
just the Intersect

239
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,232
playing with my
subconscious,

240
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,900
but I know that I'm right,
and nobody believes me.

241
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,599
Sarah doesn't believe you?

242
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,901
S- I'm trying not to
involve Sarah in this, okay?

243
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:40,199
Things are very good
between us right now,

244
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,366
and the last thing I want

245
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,466
is for her to think that I'm
- Crazy.

246
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:43,466
Yeah.

247
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,232
Well, here's the thing.

248
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,733
If this guy really
is in danger, right?

249
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:49,101
Then don't you think it would be
crazy not to help the president

250
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:50,299
of Zanfiria-bi-ha?

251
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Zam, uh...
Zamibia.

252
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:55,034
Yeah. Anyway,
I'm gonna help you.

253
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,499
Thanks, buddy, thank you.
Yeah, of course.

254
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,534
What's your pant size,
Chuck?

255
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,266
I'm just gonna say it:

256
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:04,033
I need a woman.

257
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:06,200
It's been far too long,
Jeffrey.

258
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,299
A man has needs.

259
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,599
So what's the plan?

260
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
I will be hitting on all

261
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,901
the applicable women
in electronics, DVDs,

262
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,332
and all around
the entrances

263
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,233
<i>and the emergency exits.</i>

264
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,000
You're leaving me
Home Appliances?

265
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:19,200
It's full of lumpy housewives.

266
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,600
My favorite.

267
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,567
You're welcome.

268
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:29,567
OMG, Jefferson,
is it a mirage?

269
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,466
* *

270
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:32,900
No, my eyes do not deceive me.

271
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,200
It is indeed her.

272
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,500
* *

273
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,800
It is Anna Wu.

274
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,267
I knew the day she left
to break Morgan's heart,

275
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,168
she'd come back to break mine.

276
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,133
Crush it!

277
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:52,834
Hi, guys.
Long time no smell.

278
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,801
She remembered our smell.

279
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,834
Annabelle, have you
lost weight?

280
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:59,034
Two, three grams?

281
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:02,333
Hawai'iis treating your body
very well.

282
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,566
Thanks.
Is Morgan around?

283
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,566
Who?
Who?

284
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,599
What now?

285
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,133
Morgan... Grimes.

286
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:09,168
He does still work here,
doesn't he?

287
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,666
Hey.

288
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,366
Two tickets to the
LA. City Symphony.

289
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,184
Two tuxedos from the mall.

290
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:18,933
No cummerbund.
Call me crazy.

291
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:20,067
Well done, buddy.

292
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:21,933
You nailed it.
I'm gonna head out the back.

293
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,834
You meet me
at the Herder in five.

294
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,666
Done. All right, let's go.

295
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,901
Well, I hate to be the one
to tell you this-

296
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,168
I don't really-

297
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,900
but Morgan is in, a, um...

298
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,001
a very bad place.

299
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,566
Oh, my God, is he okay?

300
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:38,134
No. He's focused,
responsible, driven.

301
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,333
Pains me to see a man
end up like that.

302
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,466
It's pathetic.

303
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:42,599
Nice try.

304
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,967
He can't have
changed that much.

305
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,467
* *

306
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,266
Whoo!

307
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,168
* *

308
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,266
Whoa, Anna,

309
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,266
what are you
doing here?

310
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,566
In L.A. for a few days.

311
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,566
Came to see you.

312
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,966
There are some things
that I want...

313
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,266
Sorry.

314
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:12,466
Sorry, don't meant to be rude.
I just...

315
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,100
Duty calls.

316
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,766
<i>You mean,
Call of Duty?</i>

317
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,667
Come on, Morgan,
your game can wait.

318
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:19,299
Why are you in a tux?

319
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,433
Uh, tux, right.

320
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,900
I'm going to the
symphony with Chuck.

321
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,966
The symphony?
With Chuck?

322
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,766
My God, can you guys
get any weirder?

323
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,232
At this point, no,
probably not.

324
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,200
Listen, I'd love to catch up
and talk and everything.

325
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,100
Why don't you call me
tomorrow morning, all right?

326
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,001
And, uh, you look good.

327
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,467
Wow!

328
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,167
Excuse me.

329
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,667
Hey, buddy, buddy,
that's Kuti up in

330
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,533
the president's box there.

331
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,332
Our mission: to make sure
nothing happens to him.

332
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,001
Now remember, Morgan, my code
name is Charles Carmichael.

333
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,700
Yeah, yeah,
I got it. I got it.

334
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:00,866
Mine's Cobra.

335
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,467
Okay, let's do this.

336
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:06,434
Great. I'm on a mission
with Cobra.

337
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,734
<i>Maybe I am going crazy.</i>

338
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,733
<i>Are you sure you want</i>

339
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,167
<i>the box set of ER?</i>

340
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:16,434
Hey, but all 15 seasons?

341
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:21,168
Yeah, I know, Devon,
it's the best show ever.

342
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay, fine.

343
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:25,567
I'll see you later. Bye.

344
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,534
Ellie?

345
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:32,900
Justin?!

346
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:34,566
Oh, I'm sorry. This is,
this is bizarre.

347
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:35,866
Why aren't you in Africa?

348
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,600
Did you, did you...
did you get malaria, too? What?

349
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,300
No, I'm actually here
to see you.

350
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,267
Can we go somewhere
and talk for a bit?

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,667
Let me ask you
a question.

352
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,333
This whole Anna
thing, you know?

353
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,401
I mean, you think
she wants me back?

354
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,401
Better question, actually:
Do I take her back?

355
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,966
Didn't she break
your heart, buddy?

356
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,633
I mean, you did
hit rock bottom.

357
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,367
Well, bottom, yeah,
but rock bottom?

358
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:16,534
Shh!

359
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:18,300
Look, later,
all right, buddy?

360
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:19,866
Remember, we're
on a mission.

361
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,033
Eyes on the president.

362
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,033
Shh!

363
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,134
Sorry.

364
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:26,501
She's, she's kind of like
the love of my life, you know?

365
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:27,899
And when you want
to talk about Sarah-

366
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,133
which is constantly-
we talk about Sarah.

367
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:30,799
So I just thought maybe
you could help me out.

368
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,600
Hey-hey-hey,
that is not fair!

369
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,501
Shh!

370
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:50,234
You work for the CIA?

371
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,234
I know it's a lot
to process,

372
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:57,267
but meeting you in Africa
wasn't an accident.

373
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:58,699
I wanted to talk
to you then,

374
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,699
but your husband got sick

375
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,799
before we could
fully brief you.

376
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,934
This is about your father,
Ellie.

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
My father? My father?

378
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,100
Are you kidding me?

379
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,100
My father is...

380
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,234
He's eccentric, sure,

381
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:14,467
But the work Stephen
J. Bartowski did

382
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:16,634
in the field of molecular
computing has turned out

383
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,233
to be... brilliant.

384
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:19,933
Which is why
as we speak,

385
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:23,534
there are some very bad
people looking for him,

386
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,501
including a man
named John Casey.

387
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:26,899
He's an NSA double agent.

388
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,967
He's been monitoring you
for another organization.

389
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:34,700
John Casey works
with my brother.

390
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:37,934
You don't have to
take my word for it.

391
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,934
Just... keep
an eye on him.

392
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,834
I caution you about telling
anyone about this.

393
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:47,601
But what about
my brother and my husband?

394
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,166
Here's the problem:

395
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,334
They're gonna tell
you you're crazy;

396
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:55,234
as crazy as you think
I am right now.

397
00:16:55,301 --> 00:17:00,668
We came to you because
we need you, Ellie.

398
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,000
Your father needs you.

399
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:09,633
What are you doing here?

400
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,266
Thought you had
a fancy date with Chuck.

401
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,668
Saw him leave the store a little
while ago in his tux.

402
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,934
Chuck's in a tux?

403
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:21,334
Pull up surveillance
in the store entrance

404
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:22,466
and the parking lot

405
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,266
from 60 minutes ago.

406
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:25,866
There, there!

407
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,233
Roll it back.

408
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:29,134
Freeze!

409
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:33,099
The concert with the
Zamibian President.

410
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,434
Chuck's gonna try and
prove us wrong about Kuti.

411
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,401
I'm gonna kill them both.

412
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:44,700
Hey, hey.

413
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,133
Chuck.

414
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,933
Why are you onstage?

415
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,533
What?

416
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,867
Buddy, I'm not onstage.

417
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,767
You shot me, Chuck.

418
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:19,899
What are you doing here?

419
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,466
What are you trying to tell me?

420
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,799
The dream isn't about me, Chuck.

421
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,267
It's about a scientist:
Dr. Kowambe.

422
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
Kowambe.

423
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,732
Oh, my God, that's him!

424
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,366
That's the guy
who's going to kill Kuti!

425
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,966
What? Are you serious?
How do you know?

426
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:41,533
I just had
another dream, buddy.

427
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:43,501
I got to get up to the
president's box! Shh!

428
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,501
Okay, listen, ma'am,
put a sock in it.

429
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:47,233
You, Morgan,
stay in the seat.

430
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,033
No. What if the seat is
dangerous? I could be attacked.

431
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:50,766
You're not gonna
get attacked.

432
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,167
There could be a sniper!
Shh! Fine, fine. Here.

433
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:55,434
Take my backup
tranq gun.

434
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,534
For life-or-death
situations only.

435
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,201
There!

436
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:11,101
You take Bartowski.

437
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,067
I got the little elf.

438
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:17,133
No, Chuck, stop.

439
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:18,600
I can't let you do this.

440
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,766
Sarah, listen, I had
another dream.

441
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,300
The guy who's gonna
kill Kuti is in

442
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,633
the president's box
right now!

443
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,400
You should have told me,
and I could have helped you.

444
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:25,766
I'm sorry, I am.

445
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,400
I- I didn't want
to get you mixed up

446
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,700
in all this dream stuff
until I had proof, all right?

447
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,633
I love you,
and right now I need you

448
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,534
to believe that I'm not crazy.

449
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,134
Okay, well, let's get
into that box.

450
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,867
Stand up and walk
out of here quietly,

451
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,668
or I'll kill you
and drag you out of here.

452
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,668
Your choice.

453
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,367
What are you reaching
for, Morgan?

454
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:04,034
I've been authorized
to use this tranq gun.

455
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,667
Now I don't want to, okay,

456
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,568
'cause I consider us friends
now, but I will use this...

457
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay, here we go.

458
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,534
Good evening.
Routine CIA weapons sweep.

459
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,300
What is the meaning of this?!

460
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:22,234
Listen, listen, the guy
right there.

461
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:24,099
Dr. Kowambe?
Yeah, Dr. Kowambe.

462
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,934
Mr. President,
who is this person?

463
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,200
Bravo! Bravo!

464
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:30,301
Okay, Chuck, just take it easy,
please.

465
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm taking it easy.

466
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,033
I'm taking it very, very easy.

467
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,832
Stop!

468
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,833
This man is Africa's most
respected scientist!

469
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,034
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

470
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,166
This is preposterous!

471
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,766
You could have at least have had

472
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,667
the pretty one frisk me.

473
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:03,699
Chuck, are you out
of your mind?!

474
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,000
What are you doing?! I was wrong!
It's not an assassination attempt!

475
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,799
He had Ring intel in his mouth!

476
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,366
The tooth! The tooth!
Find the tooth! What?!

477
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:13,234
This man is clearly insane!
Have this man arrested!

478
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:15,133
There's hidden data
in the tooth!

479
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:17,234
Wait a minute!
I can explain everything!

480
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:19,099
Guys, guys, help me!

481
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm not crazy!

482
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:23,334
Sarah!

483
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:32,467
Explain how it's possible
that last night Chuck,

484
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,100
aided by the world class spy

485
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,699
that is Morgan Grimes,

486
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,267
managed to elude you

487
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:39,168
and cause
an international incident

488
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,000
that the president
of the United States himself

489
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,499
had to apologize for.

490
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,866
In Zamibian.

491
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,033
Tricky language.

492
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:46,367
Lots of clicks and vowels.

493
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,600
General, how is
Chuck doing?

494
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,567
At the moment,

495
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,467
Dr. Dreyfus
believes Chuck's condition is...

496
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,233
worse than originally diagnosed.

497
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:59,867
Originally diagnosed?
I- I don't understand.

498
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,967
I'm sorry,

499
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,934
but the doctor believes
the Intersect

500
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,934
is overwhelming Chuck's brain.

501
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,467
His mental deterioration
may be...

502
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,267
unavoidable.

503
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:13,634
He told me he was fine.

504
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:18,101
Know that we will do
everything possible for him.

505
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,767
I care about him, too.

506
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:28,234
We'll go this afternoon.

507
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:32,034
Nothing will make him feel
better than seeing you.

508
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:47,799
Oh, my God. I can't believe
this is happening.

509
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,966
It's happening, Chuck.

510
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,399
Disturbing
as it may be,

511
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,733
you're currently
a patient

512
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,432
in a psychiatric
institution.

513
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:57,034
Best to come to terms with that
sooner than later.

514
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:59,834
Wow. You really know how
to make a guy feel better

515
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:01,300
about his situation, Doc.

516
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,100
You should meet some of
the other people here

517
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,533
with serious
psychiatric issues.

518
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,634
This is Lewis.

519
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,001
Although he currently prefers
the name Merlin.

520
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,166
Ooh, is that right?

521
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:14,067
Merlin, like the...
th-the... like the wizard?

522
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:15,566
What you in for?

523
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,033
Is it something, uh...

524
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,967
sexual?

525
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:20,466
No! No, it's not!

526
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,799
Not sexual at all.

527
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,300
I've been having these
very troubling dreams.

528
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,300
Sexual?

529
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,133
Non-sexual
troubling dreams.

530
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:27,466
Has my team
contacted you yet?

531
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,700
Ugh, don't hold
your breath.

532
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,667
I've been waiting for
my team since '93.

533
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:33,966
That's enough, Lewis.

534
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,666
What? His-his team?
What team?

535
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:36,900
Who is this guy?
He's nuts.

536
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,034
His spy team.

537
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,134
This is a CIA facility.

538
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:44,234
Everyone here
used to be a spy.

539
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,867
As I don't have to tell
you, it's a stressful job.

540
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,567
People tend
to... crack.

541
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:50,933
Everyone here?

542
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:53,067
Spies?

543
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:55,034
Like me?

544
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,766
John?

545
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:04,034
Anybody home?

546
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,666
Hi, Ellie.

547
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:11,799
What's up?

548
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,599
Hi, John. Um...

549
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,634
I just remembered that you had
mentioned something about herbs

550
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,333
for Devon's malaria.

551
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:20,967
Right.
I'll check.

552
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:23,034
Okay.

553
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:36,034
Here you go.

554
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,234
Make sure he takes them with
some nice, warm goat milk.

555
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:42,800
Okay. Thank you.

556
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:44,767
Ah.

557
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,699
Whoa, El.

558
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,799
Everything okay?

559
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,100
Okay.

560
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:55,001
I need you to listen
to me very closely,

561
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,233
and I need you
to promise me

562
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:57,333
that you're not
going to freak out.

563
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,433
Okay.

564
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:03,767
I have reason to believe that
our neighbor, John Casey,

565
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,867
is a very,
very, bad man.

566
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:07,666
And we need to get
far away from him.

567
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,301
Babe, you got to get that story
about him getting drunk

568
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:12,200
and peeing himself
out of your mind.

569
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:14,134
He was in a bad place.
It happens.

570
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:15,699
No, Devon.
I was just in his apartment,

571
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,833
and he has guns.

572
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,066
Very big guns.

573
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,333
We have to do something.

574
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,500
Okay.

575
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:24,533
Okay. Casey has
some serious guns.

576
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,101
Is that creepy? Yes.

577
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,167
Is that illegal?

578
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:31,866
Sadly, no.

579
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,699
You don't believe me?

580
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,600
You don't believe me.

581
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,001
It's just- it sounds
a little crazy, is all.

582
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,900
You think that
I sound crazy?

583
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,600
Come on, El.

584
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,300
How about I make you
a cup of tea?

585
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:48,368
Chamomile, maybe?

586
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:50,433
Hmm? Less caffeine,
but still so delicious.

587
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,433
Yes. Okay. I-I'm sure that
I do. I do sound crazy.

588
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,400
Tea's great.
Thank you.

589
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,467
<i>How you doing there, pal?</i>

590
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,933
Hmm?

591
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,733
Is there anything
we can do for you?

592
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,634
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

593
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,400
I need you to get
some evidence analyzed.

594
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,533
That scientist?
He's still out there,

595
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,900
and he's working for the Ring.
I'm sure of it.

596
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:21,834
Please, Chuck,
the way you're talking...

597
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:24,034
Come on. It's me.

598
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:26,034
I need to show you something.

599
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:39,534
Sarah, give me your hand.

600
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,368
Give your boyfriend your hand.

601
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,233
Is that...

602
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:57,268
Yeah. The tooth.

603
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:58,933
Is it yours?

604
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:01,067
What? No. That's crazy.

605
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,900
It's Dr. Kowambe's tooth.

606
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:04,901
And it's not real. It's fake.

607
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,566
It contains Ring intel.

608
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,267
Secrets, plans, something.

609
00:27:08,268 --> 00:27:09,599
In the tooth?

610
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,267
Yeah. Try to keep
up, Casey. Okay?

611
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:13,000
You need to get
that analyzed ASAP.

612
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,901
The tooth is the key.

613
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,567
The truth
is in the tooth.

614
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,499
Oh. Well, uh...

615
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,901
We'll check that out, and you
get some rest there, pal.

616
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:27,500
We'll come back and
visit you tomorrow.

617
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:31,268
Chuck.

618
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
Sarah,

619
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:36,134
you can't give up
on me, okay?

620
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,666
I won't.

621
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,567
I'll get it tested.

622
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,067
Time to go, Chuck.

623
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,532
Look, Walker,
I hope he's right, too,

624
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:26,467
but don't be disappointed
if Bartowski's... Stop it!

625
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:28,500
He's going to be right.

626
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,767
Nothing abnormal.

627
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:40,934
Just a tooth.

628
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,433
Chuck was wrong.

629
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,767
Hmm. I'm sorry.

630
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,834
* *

631
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,967
Excuse me. Does this
come in burgundy?

632
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,334
Yes, sir. I-I believe
that does come in burgundy.

633
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,766
I'll check
in the back for you.

634
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:01,933
Hey.

635
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,200
What's going on?
Where is Chuck?

636
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,200
Not now. Not now.

637
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,400
Listen. Please,
please, please.

638
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:08,367
You got to tell me something,
all right? Just let me know

639
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,300
he's okay.
Casey, please.

640
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:13,300
They got him
in a lockdown,

641
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:15,400
psychiatric facility.

642
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:17,533
Seems the Intersect's giving
him a bit of a hard time.

643
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,432
What? No. man, no.

644
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:20,599
That's crazy.

645
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,300
Morgan.

646
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,799
There you are.

647
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,399
Sorry to bother
you again,

648
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,833
but do you
have a second?

649
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:28,233
I get that you're assistant
manager now and all, but-

650
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,201
Oh, hey, I'd love to.
I'd love to. I just...

651
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,766
Now is not really
a good time.

652
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,066
So...

653
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,967
You look good.

654
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,901
Dissed twice by Morgan Grimes?

655
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:40,600
I can't believe
this is happening.

656
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,567
Right there.
Diagonally.

657
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:44,799
You have a call.

658
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,700
Huh? Oh, thanks.
Hello?

659
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,000
Chuck?

660
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,599
You can...
Hey. Hey, hey, Sarah?

661
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,734
Hey. Hey.

662
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,767
Hey, so, uh...

663
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,734
What did you find out?

664
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,567
Chuck, we ran
every test possible,

665
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:02,400
and... I'm sorry.

666
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,467
It's just a tooth.

667
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:06,433
Are you sure?

668
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:08,667
Yeah, but even though you were
wrong about the tooth,

669
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:10,133
it doesn't mean anything.

670
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:12,433
The important thing
is to stay positive.

671
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,333
Everything's going to be okay.

672
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:21,067
I know.

673
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,934
Thanks for trying.

674
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:43,367
May I help you?

675
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:46,901
I hope so. I'm here
to see a Charles Bartowski.

676
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,566
Well, there's no record
of Dr. Dreyfus authorizing

677
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,467
any after hours visits.

678
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:57,667
So, if you don't mind,

679
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:00,067
I don't want to have you
escorted from the building.

680
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,400
Of course.

681
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,367
That will not be necessary.

682
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,634
Find me Bartowski.

683
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:21,933
Good evening.

684
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:24,467
Let me guess. You're here
because of Chuck.

685
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:27,034
Doctor, I know
that there has

686
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,934
to be something more
to his condition.

687
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:31,900
He can't just be
deteriorating in this way.

688
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:33,066
Why?

689
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:34,666
Because you care about him?

690
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:35,833
No. You don't understand.

691
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,100
He's not like other people.

692
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:39,001
He is...

693
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,467
Incredibly special.

694
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:47,101
Huh. Especially
to you, I gather.

695
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,167
He needs to be okay.

696
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:52,201
I- I need him to be okay.

697
00:31:52,268 --> 00:31:54,168
I'd like to go to
the hospital tonight

698
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:55,499
and talk to him,

699
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,101
try and figure this out,

700
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,466
and then help
him somehow,

701
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,367
you know?

702
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,268
Please.

703
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,867
I love him.

704
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,333
Ever tell him that?

705
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,134
Please, Doctor,
I'm begging you.

706
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:20,400
You're not
the only one.

707
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,368
<i>Well, I'm really glad
the doctor wants to see me,</i>

708
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,467
because I sure want
to see the doctor.

709
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,800
Hey. Whoa. There's no need
to be rough or physical.

710
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,066
Jeez.

711
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:41,967
Mr. Bartowski.

712
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,733
Ooh.

713
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,634
Not the doctor
I was expecting to see.

714
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,934
Why did you take my tooth?

715
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:54,134
More to the point,

716
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:56,301
why did you take
the wrong tooth?

717
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,367
What?

718
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,700
Wha- the... the wrong tooth?

719
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,700
The data is in a tooth.

720
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,667
I believe

721
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,634
this is the fake one
you are looking for.

722
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,834
I was, I was right.

723
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,066
I was right.

724
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:13,034
Well, I was, I-I was wrong,
I was wrong.

725
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:15,201
Clearly I was wrong,
but I was right!

726
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:16,699
This is great news!
This is great news!

727
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,766
That means I'm not crazy!

728
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:18,833
Yes.

729
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:21,400
It also means,
as soon as you tell me where

730
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,834
you got your information-

731
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,500
and rest assured,
you will tell me-

732
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:29,800
you are going to die.

733
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,300
No, that's not great news
at all.

734
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,633
That's a giant needle-
bad, bad.

735
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:34,166
Colored liquid
even worse.

736
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,201
Yes, it's one of my favorites.

737
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:37,766
Tetraclydine-

738
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,901
a designer
psychotropic cocktail.

739
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:52,268
Gah!

740
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:54,234
In around ten minutes,

741
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:56,867
you're going to be
extremely forthcoming.

742
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,034
Dr. Dreyfus!

743
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:07,001
Thank God!

744
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,067
Guys. Guys!

745
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:23,134
Guys, guys, help me, help me!

746
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,069
I need you!

747
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:27,901
Awesome. Take him
back to the room.

748
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,367
Wah!

749
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:45,234
Restrain him.

750
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:47,633
I don't f-

751
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:48,966
I don't feel so good.

752
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,934
Let him go!

753
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,901
Or suffer the wrath
of Merlin and his army!

754
00:34:57,301 --> 00:34:59,201
Spies, attack!

755
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:15,966
Damn.

756
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:17,300
It was a good idea,

757
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:19,201
Merlin.
It's over.

758
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:22,168
No one believes you.

759
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:26,367
No one's coming for you.

760
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:49,934
Chuck.

761
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,733
Well, well.

762
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,667
Looks like it's good we came.

763
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,566
You came back for me.

764
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:59,734
I'll always come back for you.

765
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,867
So will Merlin, Chuck.

766
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:15,467
It seems you're owed an apology,
Agent Bartowski.

767
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:16,999
You were right about Kowambe.

768
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,367
He was illegally harvesting
human organs,

769
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,868
experimenting with genetic
manipulation and reengineering.

770
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:25,701
He was scheduled to meet a Ring
operative to sell this research.

771
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,668
Well, that's fantastic.

772
00:36:28,401 --> 00:36:30,534
I mean, not-not the organ
harvesting stuff, obviously.

773
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:32,768
That's... that's
very, very sad.

774
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,768
So, does this mean I have
a clean bill of health?

775
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:38,933
It would seem that way, Chuck,
but I can't actually clear you.

776
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,567
Well, then who can?

777
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:47,334
So... what did
we land on here?

778
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,999
That, uh,

779
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,801
my dreams have the potential to
work in concert with my flashes?

780
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:53,900
Is that where you think
we landed, Chuck?

781
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:55,700
Oh, come on, Doc.

782
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:57,233
Level with me.

783
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:58,666
Am I cleared for duty or not?

784
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,899
You were right, Chuck.

785
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,401
Your dreams were caused
by the Intersect.

786
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:03,899
I'm clearing you for duty.

787
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,133
All right.

788
00:37:05,134 --> 00:37:06,867
But...

789
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:08,768
But? But what?
Why is there a but?

790
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:12,134
But your dreams
are also proof of stress

791
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,467
the Intersect puts
on your brain.

792
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:17,300
And it is my belief that
that stress would continue

793
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,667
and intensify,
likely leading to

794
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:23,667
serious mental deterioration.

795
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,667
Um...

796
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:33,567
What does that mean exactly?

797
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,868
Am I okay?

798
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,434
This is a new science.

799
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,334
Time will tell.

800
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:46,467
* *

801
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,533
But if I may, Chuck,

802
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:53,166
I think it's something
you should discuss

803
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:56,000
with your partner, Agent Walker.

804
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,267
Thanks, Doc.

805
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:11,234
Morgan Guillermo Grimes,

806
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,032
I refuse to be
denied an audience

807
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:14,933
with the Burbank Buy More's
assistant manager.

808
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,868
If you run off on me
one more time,

809
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,967
I swear I'll call corporate.

810
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,932
She could want
you back, man.

811
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,967
That box could be
an improvised explosive device.

812
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,566
Be extremely cool
around that thing.

813
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,601
Hey, listen, I feel like
I owe you an explanation.

814
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,834
I'm so sorry. Last few
days have been insane.

815
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,099
Morgan, all I've been
trying to do

816
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,000
is get a second of your time
to give you this.

817
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:35,000
Some stuff you left behind
in Hawaii.

818
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,967
Thought you may want it back.

819
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,134
Huh.

820
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,667
I think I'm okay
without it.

821
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:45,634
Well...

822
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,801
here's something else
you may have forgotten.

823
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:54,733
I got to hand it
to you, Morgan.

824
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:56,466
You really know
how to play a girl.

825
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,768
Well, you know, some
men have it and-

826
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,734
What are you talking about?
I don't... You know what

827
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:03,266
they say about
not knowing you want something

828
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:04,266
until you can't have it?

829
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,167
Well, it's true.

830
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,299
You've changed, Morgan.

831
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,200
I want you back.

832
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,633
Wow.

833
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:12,868
Really?

834
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,134
If it took me running
from you to realize

835
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,267
that I'm somebody you want,
then I don't really think

836
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,234
that you're the
person that I want.

837
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,401
So, yeah,
you're right.

838
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:24,801
I have changed.

839
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:26,768
I'll see you later.

840
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:30,501
I don't mind leftovers.

841
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:36,066
Hey, Sarah, hey.
We need to talk.

842
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,199
Sure, Chuck, but...

843
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,733
No, look, this is
very important.

844
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:40,734
I love you.

845
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:43,067
It shouldn't have taken me
this long to say it,

846
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:44,833
but I've never felt this way.

847
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,366
Before you, the only future

848
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,300
that I could think about
was my next mission.

849
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:52,134
And now all I can think about
is a future with you.

850
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,100
I love you, Chuck.

851
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:00,501
I love you, too.

852
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,467
So what did you want to tell me?

853
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,733
Is it about the doctor?

854
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:15,367
What did he say?

855
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:19,434
He said that... I'm fine.

856
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,467
So...

857
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:42,032
Justin?
Hey.

858
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,333
It's okay.

859
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:56,734
It's just me.

860
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:58,633
So what can I do?

861
00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:00,534
Do you know how to
contact your father?

862
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:04,433
If we can talk to him, let
him know what's happening,

863
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:05,633
we may be able
to protect him.

864
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,200
He moves around a lot.

865
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:09,733
He's...

866
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:10,867
really paranoid.

867
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,000
He doesn't trust anyone.

868
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:15,767
Last time he left though,
he made sure

869
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:17,668
that I had a way to contact him.

870
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,299
Thank you, Ellie.

871
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,834
And just remember, you're
serving your country.

872
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,567
Shaw.

873
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,534
You're not bleeding anymore.

874
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,501
That's right, Chuck,
I'm not.

875
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:54,033
What does that mean?

876
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,100
It means I'm still alive.

877
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,933
Hey, what's wrong?

878
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:07,333
Nothing.

879
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:09,267
Nothing. Sorry.

880
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:11,234
Go back to sleep.

881
