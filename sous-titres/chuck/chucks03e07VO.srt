1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,333
<i>Hi. I'm Chuck.
Here's a few things</i>

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,446
<i>that you might need to know.</i>

3
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:07,191
I just got fired from my job.
Meeting you, almost makes it worth it.

4
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:09,711
If you ever find yourself in
Burbank and is still without a job,

5
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:12,568
my assistant manager owes me
about a million and a half favors.

6
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:14,478
Here's the thing.
I like her.

7
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,712
I think there's something weird
going on between Chuck and Devon,

8
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:18,819
it's like they're keeping
this big secret from me.

9
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:20,867
Finally someone with
some common sense.

10
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:22,544
We have to figure
out what's going on.

11
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,978
Don't worry about it,
I've got my best men on it.

12
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,267
Perfect.

13
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:38,701
Casey, things are getting
a little hairy in here.

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,101
Please tell me the
Intersect isn't busy.

15
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,700
<i>Busy?</i>

16
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,867
For you? Never.

17
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:49,333
I want you to teach me, Chuck.

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,766
Oh, really? Do you?

19
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:52,167
Well, I assume that you're
referring to the ancient art

20
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:53,900
of Nerd Herding, but I must warn you,

21
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:55,700
the road to computer enlightenment

22
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,499
is a long and treacherous one.

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,533
Bring it on.

24
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,000
Speaking of,

25
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,168
how about you bring me
on your next install?

26
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,366
Whoa, easy there.

27
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,100
Before you can run,
you must first learn

28
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,666
to crawl, young grasshopper.

29
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,134
Okay. Well, maybe you would
prefer to go with Jeff, then.

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,134
Just the two of you,
cramped into that tiny,

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,833
hot Nerd Herd mobile.

32
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,033
Well played, newbie.

33
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,666
Next assignment,
you get to ride shotgun.

34
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,567
Nice.

35
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,500
Excuse me for just one second.

36
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,100
What's going on?
I'm in the middle of something here.

37
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:27,866
- It's Shaw. It's bad.
- Can't it wait?

38
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:29,366
No. Not unless you want him
to suffocate to death.

39
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,267
Suffocate to death?
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,834
'Sup, Hannah?

41
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,266
Hey, just wanted to let you know,

42
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,900
if you need anyone to show
you around the, uh, Buy More...

43
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:40,067
Who is that?

44
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,866
Super hot blonde, heart of ice?

45
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:43,466
Yeah, that's Chuck's ex, Sarah.

46
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,634
Oh. What's their deal?

47
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,901
Well, deal is Sarah dumped his ass

48
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,466
and, uh, broke his heart.

49
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,600
And now she can't resist
coming back here to stomp on it.

50
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,100
Look at my boy.

51
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:55,434
Ah, poor sap.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,599
Everything all right, buddy?

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,100
Yeah, got to run.
Nerd Herd emergency.

54
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:01,734
Right now? I didn't get the call
and technically, all onsites

55
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,000
should run through
the assistant manager.

56
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,333
I gu... Wait, where are you going?

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
You heard the boss.
Nerd Herd emergency.

58
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,667
Ah, Carry on.

59
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,566
Wait a minute. I'm the boss.

60
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:29,866
Hey.

61
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:30,966
Took you long enough.

62
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,133
Yeah, good to see you, too.

63
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:33,199
You mind telling me what Shaw's doing

64
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,499
breaking into a museum vault?

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,332
Forget it. He's only got
five minutes of air left.

66
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,766
Fine. What am I doing?

67
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,366
Getting on the museum's server,
rebooting the system,

68
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,033
and opening the vault door
before Shaw gets snuffed.

69
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,533
They're never going to
let me on their server, Casey.

70
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:44,600
Well, I took the liberty of crashing it.

71
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,966
It was the only way to stop the alarm.

72
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,800
Unless you get on that server,
there's no way

73
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,734
to open the vault door.
Now get in there, Bartowski.

74
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,734
Oh, you're here.
Thank heavens someone called you.

75
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,100
Yeah, uh, what seems to be the problem?

76
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,533
I'm the curator of Classical Art.

77
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:59,168
I've never even touched one
of these machines in my life.

78
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,967
All I know is the museum went
into full lockdown mode.

79
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,267
It's designed to protect
the collections from fire,

80
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,233
but unless you fix it,
there's no way to control

81
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:08,168
the temperature or-or the humidity.

82
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,534
Some of these pieces
are extremely sensitive.

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,500
So am I, Chuck.

84
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:16,068
Chuck, we're in the
crawl space above the vault.

85
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,134
We're trying to get the door open.

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
It's four inches of solid steel.

87
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,533
We could try blowing the hatches.

88
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:22,833
We'll have to use C4.

89
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,734
No. Shaw's too close.
You're going to kill him.

90
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,666
It's up to you, Chuck.

91
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,933
You've got to get this door open.

92
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,867
Some of these artifacts
are over 3,000 years old.

93
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,534
To have survive that long
and then to be ruined

94
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,500
by some stupid computer system.

95
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:38,067
You know, if you don't mind,

96
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,833
I could really use
a little breathing room.

97
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,067
Hmm.

98
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:43,001
That's right. Step aside.

99
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:45,200
We are the professionals.

100
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,633
Hannah, what are you doing here?

101
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:49,034
Surprise. I saw your Nerd Herder
parked outside the museum.

102
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,933
And you said that I could ride shotgun.

103
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,834
So, what's the problem?

104
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,232
Get rid of her, Chuck.

105
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,133
Shaw's got less than a minute.

106
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,300
Look, I don't care which of you it is,

107
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,866
but please do something.

108
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,168
Have you ever restarted a server
from the backup database?

109
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,966
Oh, now you're just insulting me.

110
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,867
Show me what you got.

111
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:12,734
Run the context script off server one.

112
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:16,967
Validated. Next?

113
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,667
Just blow the hatch.

114
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,467
Blow the hatch.

115
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:25,766
What about the mask?

116
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,466
I'm dying.

117
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,367
Roger that.

118
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,701
Fire in the hole.

119
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,667
No, don't!

120
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,034
Don't, computer. Don't do...

121
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,332
I'm just talking to the computer.

122
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,934
'Cause sometimes,
I feel like it helps. Ha.

123
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,068
I need you to reboot
on the count of three.

124
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:50,034
One, two...

125
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,100
Oh, my God. We did it!

126
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:01,001
We did it! Hi!

127
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,100
We did it!

128
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:13,300
Not bad for your first mission.

129
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,767
Splendid work, absolutely top notch.

130
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,499
Really, I mean,
I can't thank you enough.

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,833
Well, you know, hey. Any time.

132
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,037
Oh, all right.
Um, how about tomorrow night?

133
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:21,233
What?

134
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,333
Well, it's the unveiling
of the Mask of Alexander.

135
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,033
Everyone in the art world's
going to be there,

136
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,866
and I'd like you to be also.

137
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,100
Not that I don't appreciate
the invitation...

138
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,333
Oh, no, no. I'm not inviting you.
I'm hiring you.

139
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,966
I want you there

140
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,967
to ensure that, well,
there's no more, uh,

141
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,833
what do you call them?

142
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:38,966
Bugs.

143
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,967
Take the job, Chuck.

144
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,332
You and your new partner

145
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,233
are going to help us steal
the Mask of Alexander.

146
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:47,600
So, what do you say, partner?

147
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:51,701
It's a date.

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,300
Magnificent. Isn't it?

149
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:03,835
Sync by Guga - Corrected by 4be1
www.addic7ed.com

150
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,699
What is that?

151
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,667
Double shot Americano.
No cream, no sugar.

152
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,100
The way you like it.

153
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:52,001
Oh, I almost forgot.

154
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:57,301
I noticed you like to chew them
when you get nervous.

155
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,901
Hey, gang.

156
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,833
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

157
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,133
Thanks for joining us, gentlemen.

158
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,034
I'm sure you've all
guessed that the CIA

159
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:12,334
is not interested in stealing
the Mask of Alexander.

160
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:13,833
We believe that this artifact

161
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:15,233
and possibly others,

162
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,134
are being used to smuggle
items through Customs.

163
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,300
What sort of items?

164
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,000
Items of interest to the Ring.

165
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,934
This was three months ago

166
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,967
at the National Museum of Damascus.

167
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:26,934
A team broke in,
but didn't take anything.

168
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,033
You think the Ring broke in just

169
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,266
to hide something inside the mask?

170
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,066
That's pretty smart.
Traveling exhibitions

171
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,300
don't have to go through
normal screening.

172
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:33,433
All I know is that we
have to secure the mask

173
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,799
before the Ring does.

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Chuck, you'll be in the
museum's control room

175
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,333
in case we have any other snags.

176
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,166
Casey, you'll handle surveillance.

177
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,800
Sarah, you and I will pose
as guests at the party.

178
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:48,699
We'll break in

179
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
and swap the mask, before the unveiling

180
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:52,500
with this reproduction.
Any questions?

181
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:53,933
Concerns?

182
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,934
You mean other than us bringing
a civilian on the mission?

183
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,468
I do have some new tranq darts
I'd like to try out.

184
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,233
No, no. I can handle Hannah.

185
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:02,368
Besides, she can cover for me
in my Nerd Herd duties

186
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,700
in case you guys need
to call in the big guns.

187
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:07,532
And that would... that would be me.

188
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,733
When I say "big guns", I'm referring

189
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,000
to the Intersect, to myself.

190
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:11,233
You know, if I need to flash.

191
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,301
Glad we had this talk.

192
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,301
- Morgan.
- Hey.

193
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,700
Chuck would freak if he knew
we were meeting like this.

194
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,200
Morgan, you told me

195
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,201
that Jeff and Lester would get
to the bottom of Chuck's secret.

196
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,334
I may have overstated
their abilities at bit.

197
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:35,100
What I can tell you

198
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,500
is that Chuck is hardly ever at work.

199
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:41,101
Always ducking in and out on, uh,
weird Nerd Herd calls.

200
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,167
Yeah. Like his
mysterious trip to Paris.

201
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,632
He's been acting weird ever since.

202
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,367
Right.
You want to know what I think?

203
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,666
- Not really.
- All right.

204
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,766
I think Chuck's protecting us.

205
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:50,066
Protect us from what?

206
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,166
I don't think he wants us to know

207
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,267
that he's gone to the dark place.

208
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,600
Oh, you don't mean...

209
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah. Junior year.
When Jill dumped him.

210
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,967
Sat in his room and played GoldenEye
for what, three months?

211
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,401
Who knew you could get bedsores
from playing video games?

212
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,401
This makes total sense.

213
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:06,734
This time, Sarah breaks Chuck's heart,

214
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,700
sends Chuck into an emotional tailspin.

215
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,300
Oh, let's not panic.
Let's not panic.

216
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:11,632
I'll... I'll see what I can find out,
you know?

217
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,367
How?

218
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:15,334
I'm the assistant manager
at the Buy More, okay?

219
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,899
I have my methods.

220
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,632
All right, Let's see here.
Phillips head screwdriver set?

221
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,567
Check.

222
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,699
Dummy artifact?

223
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,532
- Check.
- Harnesses?

224
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:26,301
- Check.
- And needle-nose pliers.

225
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,900
- Check.
- Descender line.

226
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,867
Check.

227
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,967
Fantastic.

228
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:34,699
Well...

229
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,401
Lock and load.

230
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:39,966
<i>You ready, Agent Walker?</i>

231
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,799
Of course I'm ready.

232
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,734
It's just, this is our first mission

233
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,632
in the field, so...

234
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,567
I want to make sure that
we're both on the same page.

235
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,567
Hmm.

236
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,533
So, you ready for your
first mission, Hannah?

237
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,632
Mission?

238
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,100
Well, I'm just trying to say

239
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,699
that, you know, you never know

240
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,367
what's going to happen out there

241
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,266
outside the protection of the Buy More.

242
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,567
You and me, we're...
we're going behind enemy lines.

243
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,734
- Okay.
- You know, maybe we should talk

244
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
about how many dates we've been on.

245
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,767
You know, we are playing
a couple tonight, so...

246
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,866
What do you think?

247
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,367
Uh, one, two?

248
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:12,566
Five?

249
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,300
Does it really make a difference?

250
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,334
It informs our cover.

251
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,567
Our chemistry, body language.

252
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,900
For instance,
have we slept together yet?

253
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,001
You got to be kidding me.

254
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,532
No, it changes the whole dynamic.

255
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,233
Well, in that case, no,

256
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:28,500
we definitely have not slept together.

257
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,667
Good to know.

258
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,934
All right, well, uh,
make yourselves comfortable.

259
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,233
I trust I shan't be seeing

260
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:53,766
either of you two again this evening.

261
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,500
The vault is scheduled
to open at precisely 8:00.

262
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:59,034
The unveiling must go
off without a hitch.

263
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:01,267
No more bugs,
no more crashes, no more...

264
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,400
No problem.

265
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,368
Problems.

266
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,499
The mask is in this vault.

267
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,766
It opens at 8:00.

268
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,967
Doesn't give us much time
to make the swap.

269
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,401
I thought I made myself
clear about our cover.

270
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:18,899
Just because we haven't slept together

271
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,467
doesn't mean we have to act

272
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:22,434
like this is a middle school dance.

273
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,867
Over there, behind that door,

274
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:27,666
is a staircase that leads

275
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,567
up to the top of the vault.

276
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:33,401
Keep an eye out on the security cameras

277
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:35,266
up to your right

278
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:37,167
and straight ahead.

279
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,799
Are we good, Agent Walker?

280
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,966
Yes, we're fine.

281
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,867
Thank you.

282
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:47,799
Man, it really is impressive...

283
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,734
The size of Alexander's empire.

284
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,166
You know what I mean?

285
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,067
Can you keep a secret, Chuck?

286
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,301
Huh? Uh... uh...

287
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:58,167
Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, kind of my forte.

288
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:00,134
Do you want to know the real reason

289
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,167
that I took this job?

290
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,434
Um... Was it the snazzy outfits?

291
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,900
No, it was the barely livable wage.

292
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,867
You.

293
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,001
Uh... me... me? Really, me?

294
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,834
It's not like I haven't been
giving you signals.

295
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,500
I hope this isn't too forward.

296
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,933
No.

297
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,166
No, forward is good.

298
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,067
In that case...

299
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,433
What did I do?

300
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,100
What did I...
Is there something wrong?

301
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,201
You and your ex-girlfriend...

302
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,201
Yeah, what? Who? Sarah?

303
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:54,334
Yeah. Morgan said that
you guys were done.

304
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,301
100% done-zo. Why?

305
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:59,267
That is her, right?

306
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,900
Any idea what she's doing here?

307
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,766
Other than making you jealous

308
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,900
with that ridiculously good-looking

309
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,000
date of hers.

310
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,100
R...  ridiculously good...

311
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,300
Him? Him? Nah.

312
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:15,533
Yeah, if you're into the...

313
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,367
the strong, kind of Superman-y

314
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:19,268
type of a guy.

315
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,101
Um, I am going to be right back.

316
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:39,467
Chuck, what are you doing here?

317
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,401
The Ring agent who broke
into the museum

318
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,166
in Damascus, Vasillis,

319
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,666
is here, and when I say "here",

320
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,834
I mean in the same room, here.

321
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,434
Look over there.

322
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,034
We have to abort.

323
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,266
We don't have a choice.

324
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,100
Vasillis and I have a history.

325
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:01,766
Are you sure he remembers you?

326
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,934
You tend to remember the guy

327
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,901
who set your face on fire.

328
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:11,468
Uh, yeah, looks like
your friend isn't alone, either.

329
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,966
They're casing the place.

330
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,266
They're here to grab the mask.

331
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:16,799
We better move right now.

332
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm not sending you in alone.

333
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,166
Hey, it's okay.
No problem. I'll go with her.

334
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,134
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

335
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,734
Get out of here, Shaw,
unless you want to blow the cover.

336
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,700
Chuck and I can handle the mask.

337
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,499
All right.

338
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,001
Casey and I will be in
the van if you need us.

339
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,967
Well, what do you say, partner?

340
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:43,934
Let's go.

341
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,033
<i>Watch those security cameras.</i>

342
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:55,266
<i>We have to assume</i>

343
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:57,099
the Ring has tapped
into those, as well.

344
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,334
Yeah, I'm, uh, one step ahead of you.

345
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,301
Sorry, Hannah.

346
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,966
Oh, no.

347
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:06,201
No, no, no, no, no, no.

348
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:15,633
What's that beeping noise?

349
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,033
Uh... And where's your partner?

350
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,934
Um, he's, uh...

351
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,200
Actually, I don't know.

352
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,500
Look, people have traveled

353
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:24,668
from all over the world
to be here tonight.

354
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,466
Now, I don't care what's going on,

355
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,066
just fix it.

356
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,700
You have five minutes
until the grand unveiling.

357
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,667
Now, go!

358
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,201
Okay, you're going to have to lower me

359
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,667
into the vault by hand.

360
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:41,699
Here.

361
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,366
So...

362
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,600
you and Shaw looked like you

363
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,033
were having fun at the party tonight.

364
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:47,133
What's that supposed to mean?

365
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,233
I'm just saying...

366
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:50,033
you two make a cute couple.

367
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:52,401
Shaw and I are playing a cover.

368
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,434
Whatever.

369
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:55,799
But the guy's a...

370
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,267
Walker and Bartowski turn off
their mics for some reason?

371
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,466
No, I did.

372
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,033
Those two gab like little schoolgirls

373
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:02,934
when they're out in the field.
It's murder on the ears.

374
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,967
- That's ridiculous.
- Ridiculous?

375
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,799
He couldn't keep his
hands off of you all night.

376
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,700
And the way he brings you
coffee every morning?

377
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:11,400
Seriously?

378
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,233
You don't see the...
You got to be blind.

379
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:14,832
You're one to talk.

380
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

381
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,366
Oh, nothing. It's just that,

382
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,166
ever since Hannah showed
up at the Buy More,

383
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,167
she hasn't been able to
keep her hands off you.

384
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,400
Cut the girl a break.

385
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:24,766
You guys are cute together.

386
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:26,867
Hannah and I are colleagues.

387
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:30,867
Forgive me for trying
to be professional.

388
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,033
Oh, I'm sorry.

389
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,366
I didn't realize professional meant

390
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,733
having her perfume
lathered all over you.

391
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,000
Come on. We got a mask to steal.

392
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:41,000
Sir, we're ready.

393
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,767
Vasillis sent his men into the vault.

394
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,300
They must have the code.

395
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,201
Walker, you've got company.

396
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,533
Bartowski, you copy?

397
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,567
Incoming.

398
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:01,468
My hands are kind of full here.

399
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:08,034
Hi there.

400
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,101
- Sarah.
 -Chuck.

401
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,767
Hang on, Chuck. I got you.

402
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay.

403
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:33,766
It's five past 8:00.

404
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,066
Why isn't the vault opening?

405
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,967
Keep your shirt on.
Almost there.

406
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,967
Almost there.

407
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:50,301
Yes!

408
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,867
Bartowski, I thought you
took care of the vault.

409
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,366
It's the girl, Hannah.

410
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,301
She must be using Bartowski's laptop.

411
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,966
We still tapped in remotely?

412
00:18:58,967 --> 00:18:59,966
Go.

413
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,433
Opening the vault right now.

414
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:03,233
Thank you so much.

415
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,134
Oh...

416
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,266
No, no.

417
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,601
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?

418
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh...

419
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,367
Oh...

420
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,534
Chuck.

421
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,234
I got it, I got it! Chuck.

422
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,668
She broke the connection.

423
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,433
Come on, man.

424
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:00,434
Go, go, go, go!

425
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:06,366
Clear! Clear!

426
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,267
We're clear.

427
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:18,934
Ta-da.

428
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,601
Hey. I'll meet you back at Castle.

429
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:32,301
Just give me a few minutes to pack up

430
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:33,866
and smooth things over with Hannah.

431
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,000
Bye.

432
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,500
Hey, Hannah.

433
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,401
Sorry about that.

434
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:42,699
Where the hell have you been?

435
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,934
How could you abandon me like that

436
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,467
on my first Nerd Herd assignment?

437
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,400
Forget it.
I know where you were.

438
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:52,301
You do?

439
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,166
Yes.

440
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,634
I saw you with your ex-girlfriend.

441
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,568
Why would you tell me
that things were over

442
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,534
between you when they're clearly not?

443
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:04,301
It's... it just...
it's not what you think.

444
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,933
Okay. Then, what is it?

445
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,967
Sarah and I have a very...

446
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,367
unique relationship.

447
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:13,899
Wow.

448
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,367
That sounds really special.

449
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:22,367
I... I cannot believe
that I made such an ass

450
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,634
- out of myself, kissing you like that.
- No, no!

451
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,034
You didn't make an ass out of yourself.
I'm... I'm the ass.

452
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,366
Yes, clearly.

453
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,233
I think we should just
keep things professional

454
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:31,400
between us from now on.

455
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:32,933
No, Hannah, let... let me

456
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,099
make it up to you.

457
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,433
Forget it.

458
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:37,200
Chuck, don't bother.

459
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:40,201
I'll see you at work.

460
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,200
That's, like, six knocks short.

461
00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,366
I don't know the knock.

462
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,366
Can I come in?

463
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:01,699
Yes, yes, he's asleep.

464
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,934
He didn't get home till God knows when

465
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,599
after doing God knows what.

466
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,399
Wait, I thought he was at work.

467
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,699
Yeah, so did I till I got

468
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,167
a pissed off call from the museum.

469
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:13,067
Chuck bailed on a Nerd Herd
and left his partner behind.

470
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:14,299
Does that sound familiar?

471
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,399
That's great.

472
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,733
So now we're back at square one.

473
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:17,800
Not necessarily.

474
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,233
I had an epiphany last night.

475
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:21,367
- What's that?
- It's a sudden, intuitive realization.

476
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:23,299
- I looked it up.
- I know what an epiphany is, Morgan.

477
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,133
I'm asking what epiphany you had.

478
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,332
Ah, right, well, I think

479
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,200
that we might be going
about this all wrong.

480
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:30,101
Okay, let's just sit Chuck down
and have an intervention,

481
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,036
force him to be honest with us.

482
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,051
It's the only way to get
to the bottom of this.

483
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,067
Get to the bottom of what?

484
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,333
Nothing, probably my breakfast.

485
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
No, what? Good morning.

486
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:41,701
Hi, morning. Morning, Ellie.

487
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:47,134
Okay, well, we're going
to be late for work.

488
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,966
Oh, look at that.

489
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,901
- My goodness.
- You...

490
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,867
- We can't do this right now.
- What are you talking about?

491
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:53,933
You just said "intervention".

492
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:55,834
What is wrong with you?

493
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,801
You are a coward.

494
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,201
That's who stole my mask.

495
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,734
Pause it.

496
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:18,001
Who is she?

497
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,901
Oh, he's good.

498
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,901
A real Casanova, this one.

499
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:26,300
He used the blonde
to get into the vault

500
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:30,067
and seduced the computer girl
to access the security system.

501
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:34,168
It's time to see how coldhearted

502
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:36,268
our thief really is.

503
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,934
Tough night at the museum?

504
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:45,800
Curator called me
and gave me an earful.

505
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,332
Oh, really? What did he say?

506
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,033
You know, I don't really know.

507
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:51,367
I have a hard time making out
British accents, you know.

508
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:52,432
To me, it's just

509
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,267
"Oi, blighty this."

510
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,600
You know, it kind of just
reminds me of Mrs. Doubtfire,

511
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,567
which is an awesome flick.

512
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:00,800
So what did happen last night?

513
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:03,101
Well, you know, I...
I don't want to point any fingers...

514
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,167
Don't snitch...

515
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:06,066
code of the streets.

516
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,817
What are you talking about?

517
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:09,499
Well, your loyalty to Chuck.

518
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,866
You know, I get it.
You want to protect

519
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,167
your boss, but here's the thing.

520
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:14,134
I'm his boss is what I'm saying.

521
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,433
Actually, I don't want you
to think of me as your boss' boss.

522
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,866
I'd rather you think of me as a friend

523
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:19,767
ultimately, you know,

524
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:21,967
and a friend you can tell anything to.

525
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,801
And I do mean anything.

526
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,134
Excuse me.

527
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,000
Hello. Nerd Herd.

528
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,733
I'm calling from the museum.

529
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:34,766
Another doofus with an accent.

530
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,934
Can you believe this?

531
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,599
How may I help you?

532
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,234
We are still having problems
with our computer system.

533
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,967
Perhaps you can send the
girl you sent last night.

534
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:45,967
Uh, you must mean Hannah.

535
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:48,433
Right.

536
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,766
Hannah.

537
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,332
Absolutely, I think she'd be
happy to come back out,

538
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,233
and in fact, to make up for the hiccup,
it's on the house.

539
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:55,133
I can even send her supervisor along.

540
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,801
But I... cannot do that actually, um...

541
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,399
He is busy.

542
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm sure she'll be able to
handle the problem herself.

543
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:04,034
She-she will indeed, absolutely.

544
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:05,666
- Okay.
- Thank you,

545
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,499
Morgan, you are a great friend.

546
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,034
That's very sweet of you...

547
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:13,067
and also very poignant because...

548
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:15,600
I believe that that's
a great place to start,

549
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,400
you know, and then
we can build from there.

550
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,834
Oh, God.

551
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:26,634
Good morning, Walker.

552
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,299
Okay, we need to talk.

553
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,666
- About last night?
- About everything.

554
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,901
About professional boundaries,

555
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,000
about you bringing me coffee

556
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,200
to work every morning and noticing

557
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,767
that I like to chew
on my swizzle sticks.

558
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,233
You're embarrassing us both.

559
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:39,599
We are just colleagues and that is

560
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,766
all we are ever going to be,

561
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,667
so please keep your coffee

562
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,366
and your cheesy come-ons to yourself.

563
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,267
Okay, you got that?

564
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,367
Good, now let's get back to work.

565
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:53,001
I feel like I should probably
apologize to Colonel Casey.

566
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:56,066
Hey, Shaw, thanks for the coffee.

567
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:59,001
Just the way I like it. Black and bitter.

568
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:14,867
Hello?

569
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,567
Nerd Herd.

570
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:21,867
Hi, someone called.

571
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,467
Yes, thank you for coming.

572
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,967
Where's the old curator?

573
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,866
He's tied up.

574
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,767
I'm the assistant curator.

575
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:31,866
This way.

576
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,100
We've been having problems

577
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:34,933
with the security system in the vault,

578
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,133
if you don't mind

579
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,299
having a look.

580
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,500
I really just fix computers.

581
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:42,001
You seem like a smart girl.

582
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,233
You'll figure it out.

583
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,700
Oh, you don't happen to have a phone?

584
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,901
No, I left it in the car.

585
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,101
Don't worry.

586
00:26:58,134 --> 00:26:59,633
Hey.

587
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,734
Hey!

588
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,800
Nerd Herd. How can I help you?

589
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:13,499
You can bring me my mask.

590
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,600
Uh, I think you might have
the wrong number, sir.

591
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,033
Let me rephrase.

592
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,967
Either you bring me the mask or
I kill your girlfriend.

593
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,467
Morgan, have, uh, have you seen Hannah?

594
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,767
Yeah, she's out on a call.
Something at the museum.

595
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,433
Sir, first of all,
I... I don't have a girlfriend,

596
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,033
just for clarification's sake,

597
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,233
and second, like I mentioned earlier,

598
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:41,299
this is the Nerd Herd desk,

599
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,399
so unless you have
a computer-related...

600
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,933
I know who you are.

601
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:46,967
If you want to see the girl alive,
you'll come to the museum

602
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,499
and come alone.

603
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,867
She runs out of air in 30 minutes.

604
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,467
Bring me my mask.

605
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,633
Hey, buddy.

606
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:00,800
Uh, here we go.

607
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:03,333
- Chuck, I think we need to talk.
- Not a good time.

608
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,934
You know what?
I don't care anymore.

609
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:16,667
Listen, I'm your best friend, dude,
or at least I used to be,

610
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:17,933
and I deserve to know what...

611
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,100
No, I demand to know

612
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,001
what the hell is going
on with you lately.

613
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,867
Chuck...
You got to be kidding me.

614
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:27,834
Hmm, check the base.

615
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,200
- Chuck.
- Sarah...

616
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,666
Sarah, I need the mask now.

617
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:41,800
Vasillis knows we took it

618
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,167
and he wants it back.
He grabbed Hannah.

619
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,068
I'm coming down the tunnel.

620
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:47,866
That can't be good.

621
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:51,134
Uh, Chuck, don't come in here.
 We think the mask is some kind of a...

622
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,834
No.

623
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:16,466
Oh, no.

624
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,766
Guys, guys, it's poison.

625
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:19,033
You think?

626
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:20,699
It's a designer weapon
developed for battlefield use,

627
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
but th... there's a counteragent

628
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:23,366
that can be taken up to
30 minutes after exposure.

629
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,033
Or what?

630
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,866
Look, don't worry.

631
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,299
I'm gonna get the
counteragent from Vasillis.

632
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,533
He wouldn't have shipped
the weapon without it.

633
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,734
It's got to be back at the...

634
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,934
Casey, gear up.
We're heading back to the museum.

635
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:53,367
- This is never gonna work.
- It'll work.

636
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
Here.

637
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,500
Okay... okay, fine.

638
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,200
So let's say we're able
to fool Vasillis

639
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,633
with another fake mask
and we save Hannah.

640
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:04,933
That still doesn't solve the problem

641
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,934
of how we convince him
to give us the counteragent.

642
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:08,233
What about Sarah and Shaw?

643
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:10,467
Do we have enough time
to save them, too?

644
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,167
Wait, wait, I got it, I got it.

645
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:15,167
We gas him.

646
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:16,800
That's a great plan,

647
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,599
except the chemical weapon's
already been deployed.

648
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,168
Yeah, but Vasillis doesn't know that.

649
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:26,367
I got some smoke grenades in the back.

650
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:30,433
Funny, I don't feel like I'm dying.

651
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,534
Chuck will come through for us.

652
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,500
In case he doesn't...

653
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,500
I wanted to clear the air between us.

654
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:40,467
It turns out I haven't been

655
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:44,101
completely honest about, uh, the coffee

656
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:47,834
and how I was acting at the museum.

657
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,967
Truth is I was hitting on you.

658
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:55,666
It was completely unprofessional

659
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,734
and I apologize.

660
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,967
I owe you an apology as well.

661
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,934
I overreacted.

662
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,667
The way you touched
my neck at the party...

663
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:17,134
I guess it was kind of nice.

664
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,901
Really?

665
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,901
Really.

666
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:27,067
Well, then,
I... I'm glad we had this talk.

667
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:31,467
Yeah, me, too.

668
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,000
The poison has been contained.

669
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,901
The room has been cleared.

670
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,767
We got to get you out of here.

671
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,467
Stop there.

672
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:04,168
Show me my mask.

673
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,500
Show me my Nerd Herder.

674
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:14,066
She's in the vault.

675
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,967
Oh, look at the time.

676
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,934
Air must be getting a little thin.

677
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,600
If he doesn't open the door,
I'm going to blow the vault.

678
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:25,900
I can't promise she'll be okay.

679
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:27,332
I did what you asked
and I brought the mask.

680
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:28,366
Now let her out.

681
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,333
If it were up to me, sure.

682
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,633
She would walk free.

683
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:34,168
But the people you've stolen from,

684
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:37,467
the Ring, they're not so forgiving.

685
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:38,766
Do what you want to me

686
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,233
but the girl had nothing
to do with this.

687
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:42,801
You're in no position to make demands.

688
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:45,534
You gave up any leverage
you might've had

689
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,734
when you walked in with the mask.

690
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,701
Not quite.

691
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:53,399
I think we all know
what's inside this mask.

692
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,267
So either you open that
door and let her out

693
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:57,700
or I release the gas.

694
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,801
I don't believe you.

695
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,599
Well, that's too bad.

696
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,500
You should've.

697
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,599
You've killed us all.

698
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,900
You idiot!

699
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:12,000
Well, there's a counteragent, right?
Where is it?

700
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:13,901
It's in a vase.

701
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:15,900
There's hundred of them.

702
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:16,733
Which one?

703
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:18,299
How am I supposed to know?

704
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,200
I wasn't going to steal it personally.

705
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:22,101
Oh, I see, and I'm the idiot?

706
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,499
Come on, Chuck.

707
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,433
One of these things
is not like the others.

708
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,600
Oh. Oh.

709
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,967
Time's up, Chuck.

710
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,267
No, Casey, wait!

711
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:04,499
I found the counteragent.

712
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,100
Meet me in the control room.

713
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:09,201
When do I get to blow something up?

714
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:14,733
Casey, here, here.

715
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:15,933
How time we got left?

716
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,100
Don't worry about that.

717
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:19,400
You get her out of the vault.

718
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:20,900
You don't have enough time, do you?

719
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,399
Focus, Bartowski.

720
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,133
Even if they are lost,

721
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:25,399
we still have a civilian in there.

722
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,367
Get her out of there!

723
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,533
Come on, come on.

724
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,434
Yes!

725
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,267
Sarah? Shaw? What the...?

726
00:34:59,268 --> 00:35:00,432
Here's the counteragent.

727
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,034
I'll go release the curator.

728
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:14,101
- You okay?
- Yeah.

729
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:16,168
Yeah, thank you.

730
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,801
Hannah? Hannah? Hannah?

731
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,699
- What happened?
- You, uh...

732
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,467
You passed out and I think, uh,

733
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,467
somehow you got trapped in the vault.

734
00:35:41,534 --> 00:35:43,167
Oh, my God.

735
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:45,134
I could've died in here.

736
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:50,201
You saved my life, Chuck.

737
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:51,633
Well, I don't...

738
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,600
Oh, hey.

739
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:58,201
Hey, hey.

740
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:00,234
Look, I know I was acting really weird

741
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
- the other night...
- Forget it.

742
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,399
Nice work, everyone.

743
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,599
And you...

744
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,399
- I owe you one, Bartowski.
- Oh, come on.

745
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,901
Just 'cause I saved your life. Twice.

746
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:34,766
Don't mention it.

747
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,267
It wasn't just my life.

748
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:37,766
Yeah.

749
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:38,866
You also helped

750
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,466
secure a rogue chemical weapon.

751
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:41,966
Guys.

752
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,901
Look, I appreciate a ticker tape parade

753
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,300
just like the next guy,

754
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:47,400
but, come on, I got a great team.

755
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:50,134
And that brings us to our
next point of business.

756
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:52,101
Well, uh, Chuck,

757
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:54,067
you're not going to have us forever.

758
00:36:54,134 --> 00:36:56,101
The Intersect was originally designed

759
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:58,067
so that agents could work autonomously.

760
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,100
We're your training wheels.

761
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:02,432
And your performance tells me

762
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,368
that it's about time for
us to come off.

763
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,901
Hope you're ready for your
big boy bike, Bartowski.

764
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:12,368
Huh.

765
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,334
Hey.

766
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,934
Uh, I just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

767
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:25,700
Yeah. I mean, I guess
I've gotten used to us being a team,

768
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,934
- you know.
- Well, we're not going anywhere yet.

769
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:29,934
But Shaw's right.

770
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,934
At some point I'm just going
to be standing in your way,

771
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,400
and not just professionally.

772
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:37,433
Right.

773
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:40,934
Are you sure you're okay
with the whole Hannah thing?

774
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:43,934
Oh, I should've have
given you a hard time.

775
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:46,433
She's great and...

776
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,600
How do you think
I feel about you and Shaw?

777
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,901
I mean, you two are perfect together.

778
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:53,499
It's disgusting.

779
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,499
Oh.

780
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,033
In... in... in a heartwarming

781
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:58,067
kind of way.

782
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:03,034
Look, all I know is the guy carried you

783
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:04,133
out of Castle on his back

784
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,301
while you were both dying.

785
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,166
So, if I have to see you
with someone else

786
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,833
it might as well be a hero, right?

787
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,034
What can I say?

788
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,101
I have a type.

789
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,634
I'll see you, Sarah.

790
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,433
Bye, Chuck.

791
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:47,368
Well done on the knock.

792
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,866
- Really?
- Yeah.

793
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:50,066
Is Chuck here?

794
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:51,866
Slinking around somewhere, yeah.

795
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:53,100
Uh, you ready to do this?

796
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:55,001
Time for an intervention.

797
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:01,134
What is Chuck doing here so late?

798
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,866
This is exactly the behavior

799
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,367
I was talking about, Ellie, okay.

800
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:05,766
Your brother...

801
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,399
He is into something weird here.

802
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
No, no...

803
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,734
- Cameras, cameras, cameras.
- Morgan, listen to me.

804
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,499
Whatever is going on behind that door,

805
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,400
we need to know about, okay?

806
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,633
This is for Chuck.

807
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,399
For Chuck.

808
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,599
- Yes.
- You go.

809
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,500
- You go.
- Okay, I will.

810
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,966
Oh, my God!

811
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,934
Chuck has a secret girlfriend.

812
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:46,733
This means he's moving
on with his life,

813
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:48,399
and he's not wallowing in self-pity,

814
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,900
and playing video games.

815
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:51,834
This is such a relief.

816
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:54,001
Such a relief.

817
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,001
Man.

818
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,933
Okay, I'm going to head out.

819
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:11,966
You two coming?

820
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:13,867
Uh, no, I'm going to finish up in here.

821
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,901
Yeah, I'm... I'm pretty buried, too.

822
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:17,799
So...

823
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,767
Ah.

824
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:36,500
We both know how dangerous this is.

825
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,500
Relax, Sarah.

826
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:41,734
I'm the safest guy in the world.

827
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,433
Are you sure it was him?

828
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,500
I'd never mistake Daniel Shaw.

829
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:06,533
What are you going to do to him?

830
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,800
Same thing I'm going to do to you.
