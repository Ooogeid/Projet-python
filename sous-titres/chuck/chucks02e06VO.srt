1
00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:01,919
<i>Hey, I'm Chuck.
Here's a couple of things</i>

2
00:00:01,987 --> 00:00:03,827
<i>that you might need to know
or maybe you just forgot.</i>

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,567
So, do you have a girlfriend?

4
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:07,675
I did a while back at Stanford.

5
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:09,683
Oh.
- Yeah  her name was Jill.

6
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:10,888
We met freshmen year.

7
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:12,729
We had so much in common then.

8
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:13,698
Bryce Larkin.

9
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,372
Dude pretended to be his buddy

10
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,016
<i>sexed up his girl and got him
kicked out of Stanford.</i>

11
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,020
Stanford was five years ago.

12
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:20,292
You need to move on.

13
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,132
Fine, I'll get over Jill tomorrow.

14
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:38,027
Hey, Chuck!

15
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:39,299
That's the dude that got

16
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,571
kicked out for cheating.

17
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:43,583
Yeah, I didn't cheat,
actually, it's...

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,585
Oh! Hey, I'm just--

19
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,023
If you guys don't mind,
I'm just gonna borrow these.

20
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,262
Continue with your game.

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,366
Gonna have to turn
this off, too.

22
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,842
Jill!

23
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:01,821
Come on.

24
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,330
Jill! Hey!

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,401
It's Chuck. Please,

26
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,241
I-I want a chance

27
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,283
to explain my side face-to-face.

28
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:12,563
If Jill wanted
to speak to you

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,340
she would have returned
one of your 28 phone calls.

30
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,947
Hi, Shari.

31
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:19,121
Is she up there?

32
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,978
Jill...

33
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:26,718
I, uh,

34
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:28,190
I was on break at-at work.

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,164
I'm actually working
at a Buy More.

36
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:32,039
Of all places, yeah.

37
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,478
And I drove, you know,

38
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:37,125
346 miles straight
from Burbank

39
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:41,710
to see you and to tell you
that I still love you.

40
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:45,692
Loser!

41
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:50,444
Chuck!

42
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,950
Hey, hey, Jill!

43
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,092
Hey, um, I think

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,170
I've thoroughly publicly
embarrassed myself enough,

45
00:01:57,238 --> 00:02:00,550
so you think maybe we could go
talk over some coffee

46
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:01,688
or something like that?

47
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,164
It's too late, Chuck. It's over.

48
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:05,704
When you say "it's over,"

49
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:07,745
you mean, like, this
conversation's over, right?

50
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,317
To be continued
at the Starbucks?

51
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:12,865
She's dating Bryce Larkin
now, Chuck.

52
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,672
Bryce...

53
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,876
Deal with it.

54
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,550
I told you he was a loser.

55
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:21,298
Is that true?

56
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:26,954
I'm sorry, Chuck.

57
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:31,002
# #

58
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:42,681
Oh, I hate to disturb
your reverie there, Chuck.

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,090
I'm going to need you

60
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,564
to get down to the
Sheraton Conference Center

61
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:47,634
for a tech-support call.

62
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:48,872
<i>Pronto.</i>

63
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:50,746
Sure thing, Emmet.

64
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:52,353
Got any Boston cream in there?

65
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:54,160
Oh, yeah, several.

66
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,551
Ah...

67
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,425
Why, Emmet, you shouldn't have.

68
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:06,608
Oh, they just look delicious.

69
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,685
Oh, my God.

70
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,767
You breathing?

71
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:26,319
Try to relax.
Try to relax.

72
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:27,590
Oh, my God!

73
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:30,736
Help! This man's dying!

74
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:36,291
No, no, Emmet, Emmet, you're
doing it wrong-- you're supposed

75
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,964
to hold his mouth open,
reach down and grab it.

76
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,691
Guess that way
works, too.

77
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,535
Are there any more donuts?

78
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:51,451
Huh, BioScience conference.

79
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,124
I bet these things
get pretty wild, huh?

80
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,734
All right,o the networks
should now be all set up

81
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:59,382
with ten-based T Ethernet
connecting all the servers

82
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,724
for the conference
with a firewall in place.

83
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:14,809
Is there a problem?

84
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:15,879
Can you tell me

85
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,017
if the attractive brown-eyed,

86
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:18,623
slightly egg-headed brunette

87
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,200
with an extremely cold heart
is still here?

88
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:23,743
She's here.

89
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,249
Why? Who is she?

90
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:27,056
Jill Roberts, my ex-girlfriend.
She broke my heart.

91
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,834
I need, I need a diversion.

92
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,440
Would it be
a terrible imposition

93
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:33,046
for you to pull
the fire alarm?

94
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:35,322
Hi, I'm Dr. Jill Roberts.
Is there someone

95
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,497
that can help me with the tech
requirements for my lecture?

96
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:38,601
Under the desk.

97
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:39,840
What?

98
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,453
Hi.

99
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,993
Chuck?

100
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,198
Ah!

101
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:50,012
It was the flange just there.

102
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,485
Chuck Bartowski.

103
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:52,958
Present.

104
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,664
Yes, that's me.

105
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,873
It's me, Jill.

106
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:59,383
Jill, oh, my gosh! Of course!

107
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:00,654
Yes.

108
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:02,495
Hi.
- Hi.

109
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:03,599
Hey, you!

110
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,105
How are you?!
- Good.

111
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,950
So good to...
see you.

112
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,890
You, too.
How long has it been?

113
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,032
Five years, four months-ish,

114
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,274
give or take, kind of
in that neighborhood.

115
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:16,717
Uh, what have you been up to?

116
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:17,956
Uh, well, after Stanford,

117
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:20,030
I got my PhD in biomedical
engineering.

118
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,436
Did you?

119
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:23,042
Yeah. I'm giving a presentation
at the conference

120
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,180
on infectious diseases.

121
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:25,452
Lovely.

122
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,522
And you?

123
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,028
And me.

124
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,233
And me.

125
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,973
Uh-uh still in the computer
game, you know?

126
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,951
Yeah, I-I-I work my own,
my own little,

127
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,356
little-little company.

128
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:37,967
16, 17-- I can't remember which--
stores.

129
00:05:38,035 --> 00:05:40,476
But every once
in a while

130
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:42,484
I like to do the installs
myself, you know,

131
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,426
don the uni, kind of
get my hands mussy.

132
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:45,831
I'm really happy
for you, Chuck.

133
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,906
The-the last time
I saw you were--

134
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,880
you were working
at a Buy More.

135
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:51,018
Ah!

136
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,595
That was a wonderful
growing experience.

137
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,267
Really, really
character building.

138
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:56,974
And I wouldn't-- wouldn't
change it for the world.

139
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:58,279
Well...

140
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,287
there's definitely some
things I would change.

141
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:03,433
Especially about us.

142
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,742
There you are.

143
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,047
We're running late.
- Oh.

144
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,390
Guy, this is
my old friend

145
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,264
Chuck Bartowski--
Chuck, this is my boss

146
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,234
Guy LeFleur.

147
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,509
Hi. Nice to meet you.

148
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:16,785
I work with germs,
so, you know.

149
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,653
I'm sure your friend's busy.

150
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:27,795
Has, uh, computers to fix.

151
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:28,899
Shall we?
- Sure.

152
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:34,019
Chuck, I'm staying at
the Hotel Waldron,

153
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:36,530
so give me a call if you want
to grab a cup of coffee.

154
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,106
Yeah, uh, well, you know,
I'm busy.

155
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:40,779
I'll check
with my people.

156
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:46,033
<i>Your ex-girlfriend's boss,</i>

157
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,446
Guy LeFleur, is the head
research scientist

158
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:52,190
for the European company
Cole-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

159
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:54,031
And my six has reports

160
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,541
that he may have developed a
bioweapon which he plans to sell

161
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:57,813
to the highest bidder.

162
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,418
Is Jill involved?

163
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,690
It's your job to find out,
Chuck.

164
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:02,832
Casey and Sarah will surveil
Dr. LeFleur.

165
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,576
We need you
to reconnect with Jill.

166
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:07,116
Find out what she knows
about Guy.

167
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,822
Right, right, right, right.

168
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,633
When you say "reconnect,"
you mean send her an e-mail

169
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,444
or invite her to be
my new FaceBook friend, right?

170
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:17,121
Call her at her hotel
and make a date.

171
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,895
See if you flash
on anything she says

172
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:20,267
or anyone you meet.

173
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:21,873
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a date

174
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,446
with my ex?
No, General,

175
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:24,919
that-that is
a terrible idea.

176
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:25,990
You see, she broke my heart.

177
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,060
She destroyed me.

178
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:28,734
She took all
of my confidence,

179
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:30,038
my mojo.

180
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:31,979
You had mojo?
- I was on my way.

181
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,819
Oh, and by the way,
she slept with Bryce Larkin.

182
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,426
Hmm. Who hasn't?

183
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,777
Look, Chuck, I know
that Jill hurt you,

184
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,751
but maybe seeing her again
will give you the closure

185
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:42,989
that you've always wanted.

186
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:45,064
You have done a
lot for the CIA,

187
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,971
and we're gonna make
you look good.

188
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,042
Yeah, look on the bright side.

189
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,481
Now you can get your mojo back.

190
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:38,320
As you already know we nearly
lost our dear leader today.

191
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,161
And to what?

192
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,537
One tiny little carb-filled
donut.

193
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:43,875
Please. We lost Big Mike

194
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:45,247
to donuts years ago?

195
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,201
I shudder to think how people

196
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,578
like you would respond to
an actual catastrophe.

197
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:55,523
A fire, an earthquake...

198
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:57,966
An all-out race war.

199
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:03,890
And that is why Michael
and I have decided

200
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,630
to implement an emergency
preparedness course.

201
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,643
And it just so happens

202
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:10,684
that one of your colleagues knew
someone willing to teach it.

203
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:12,759
<i>Buenos dias, class.</i>

204
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,704
Hey, uh, you sure you
want to do this?

205
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,712
I love volunteer work,
Chuck.

206
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:19,319
Besides,
CPR's a breeze.

207
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:20,792
A child could learn it.

208
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,632
Well, then maybe
you have a shot.

209
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,239
Uh, hey, everybody,
you're in great hands.

210
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:25,812
Awesome is who certified me.

211
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,385
You might be certified,
Chuck.

212
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,460
But you still have to take
the test like everyone else.

213
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,536
Let's go, Romeo.

214
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,677
Time for your
big date.

215
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:37,091
The CIA is shelling out a
lot to make you look good.

216
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,062
Okay, so who's ready to pound
some plastic?

217
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:46,496
Hey!

218
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,035
Wow.

219
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:49,106
New suit?

220
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,311
You have a big date?

221
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,717
No big date. Why?

222
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:53,625
Looks expensive.
- No, no, no, no.

223
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,098
It was cheap.
Yeah, real cheap.

224
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,302
It was on sale.

225
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,808
I had a coupon.
- Uh-huh.

226
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,448
I think it's cute you get
all dressed up for Sarah.

227
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,854
She's lucky.

228
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,294
Hey, sis.

229
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:04,402
Hmm?
- Um...

230
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,778
do you ever think about your
ex-boyfriend, Doug Wald?

231
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,016
No. Why?

232
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,388
Let's say

233
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,664
totally randomly old Dougie,

234
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,371
you know, you guys ran
into each other

235
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,447
and he asked you out to dinner
to catch up

236
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,388
on old times?
What would you say?

237
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:20,467
I guess theoretically,
I'd say yes.

238
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,341
I am so glad you said that.
You see,

239
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,817
I-I'm not going out
with Sarah tonight,

240
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:27,596
I'm actually going out
with Jill.

241
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:28,901
Jill?! No!

242
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,039
No, no, no!

243
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,445
Absolutely not!

244
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:32,784
What, what about what you
just said about Doug?

245
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:34,289
Just forget
what I just said, okay?

246
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,762
There is no scenario
in which you should

247
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,402
be going to dinner
with the girl that dumped you,

248
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,913
broke your heart and slept
with your best friend.

249
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,418
Chuck, you bought a new suit?

250
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:43,226
I told you, coupon.

251
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:45,000
Chuck...

252
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:48,346
look, I'm trying not to be
the overprotective big sister.

253
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,786
You? Never.

254
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:52,397
It's just that I know
that she hurt you, you know?

255
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:54,438
I don't want to see you go
through that again.

256
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,881
But...

257
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,519
Sticky clutch.

258
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,297
Remind me to have my
assistant to have that fixed.

259
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:19,607
I think the valet's
up a little further.

260
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:21,180
Beautiful night
for a walk, huh?

261
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,552
Shall we?

262
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,697
Okay. Here we go.

263
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,179
Thank you.

264
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,321
Hey, Bartowski.

265
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,028
Welcome.
- Thank you.

266
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,734
Hope you haven't been
waiting long. Right this way.

267
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,106
Hey.

268
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:37,813
Hello, sir.

269
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:39,253
Hello. Yeah, hello.

270
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,499
Hi.

271
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,340
Looking good, Mr. Bartowski.

272
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:45,511
Looking good.

273
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:49,260
Is everyone in here CIA?

274
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:50,465
Of course.

275
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,735
Huh, thank you
Jonathan.

276
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,755
Wow, I'm impressed.

277
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:14,328
It's like you own the place.

278
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:15,868
No, no, no,
God no.

279
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,374
Just, uh, just an investor.

280
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,646
I mean, what can I say?

281
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:20,587
I'm a sucker
for a good veal parm.

282
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:22,628
Good evening,
Mr. Bartowski.

283
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,603
Can I get
you two anything to drink?

284
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:25,675
The usual perhaps?

285
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,051
A 2000 Les Fiefs de Lagrange.

286
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,397
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

287
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,640
I'm really glad

288
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,812
things turned out
so well for you, Chuck.

289
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,660
Especially after,
you know, what happened.

290
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,224
Yeah, uh... about that.

291
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,098
Um, Jill,

292
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,642
I-I never stole those tests.

293
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,449
Well, uh,
that doesn't matter now.

294
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,323
<i>Sure, it doesn't matter now.</i>

295
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:57,369
You know, now that I drive
a fine Italian automobile

296
00:12:57,438 --> 00:13:00,014
and I'm alarmingly
well-known

297
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:01,687
at this
particular restaurant,

298
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:04,465
<i>but I needed you to believe me
when it did matter.</i>

299
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:08,079
I do believe you,
Chuck, and...

300
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,954
maybe I should've
believed you at Stanford.

301
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:12,396
But the tests
were in your room

302
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:14,071
and Bryce said
you were cheating.

303
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,045
What was I supposed
to think at the time?

304
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,689
Yeah, Bryce must've made a very
convincing argument

305
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,902
for you to dump me and then
hop right into his bed.

306
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,182
# #

307
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:31,005
Maybe this
wasn't such a good idea.

308
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,449
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Bartowski,

309
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,859
but there's a phone call
for you at the bar.

310
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:40,645
Excuse me.

311
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:49,078
What do you think
you're doing?

312
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:50,183
Getting closure.

313
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,761
She owes me
an explanation.

314
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:54,166
No, she doesn't.

315
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,974
She exercised her First
Amendment right to dump you.

316
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,949
Now get back in there and find
out what Guy is planning.

317
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,487
Look, Chuck,
I know it's hard,

318
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:01,596
but tonight, you have
to be a spy first.

319
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,571
Yeah, it is hard.
I'm not like you, Sarah.

320
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,215
I can't turn my emotions
on and off like some robot.

321
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:10,164
I'm sorry,
that was uncalled for.

322
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,574
I'm not acting
like myself tonight.

323
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,247
Are you done feeling sorry
for yourself?

324
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,323
Personally, I'd like
another ten to 15 minutes

325
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,531
of really pathetic
self-indulgence,

326
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,736
but duty calls.

327
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:21,376
I'm going back in.

328
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,418
Thanks.

329
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,342
Sorry about that.

330
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,183
No more interruptions.

331
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,760
I promise,
and, uh, by the way,

332
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:35,835
that guy who was just sitting
here a couple minutes ago.

333
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:37,475
You remember him? Looked just
like Chuck Bartowski?

334
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,018
He was a little whiny
and bitter?

335
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,893
Turns out,
he's an imposter.

336
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,136
Really?
- Yeah, really, but don't worry about it,

337
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:47,114
'cause I just kung fu'd
him at the bar,

338
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:49,156
and he won't be bothering you
for the rest of the evening.

339
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,097
Oh, I'm glad,

340
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,641
'cause I like this
Chuck Bartowski a lot more.

341
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,214
Me, too.

342
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:02,142
So, uh,
you never told me

343
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,748
exactly what
you were working on.

344
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:06,191
Oh, uh, I can't
really talk about it.

345
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:10,074
That sounds mysterious, I know.

346
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:12,383
I'm starting to think there are
some sketchy people involved.

347
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:14,424
I'm probably just
being paranoid.

348
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,332
I just, I don't know
who to trust.

349
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,240
You can trust me.

350
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,060
Remember biochem?

351
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:24,399
We're working

352
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,206
on a strain of influenza,
specifically

353
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,448
how the hemagglutinin protein
fuses the viral envelope

354
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:29,620
with the vacuole's membrane.

355
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:31,227
Did that sound like

356
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:32,532
total gibberish?

357
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,142
I understood completely,
"Do you remember biochem?"

358
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,251
And then everything
after that was a little fuzzy.

359
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,957
Okay, I'll simplify.

360
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,296
Yo, Charles!

361
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:41,368
Hey, buddy.

362
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,740
Who's the babe?

363
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,919
First Sarah,
now this Chiquita banana?

364
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,546
When are you going to start
sharing the wealth, buddy?

365
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,028
Nice to meet you.

366
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,466
Who's, uh, Sarah?

367
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,014
And, um, are these
friends of yours?

368
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,558
No. No, they're just
old, old Buy More

369
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,930
colleagues that
haven't moved on.

370
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,871
Move on. Move on.

371
00:15:58,939 --> 00:15:59,942
Your car, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

372
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:04,159
Whoa! Whose Ferrari?

373
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:05,866
This isn't your car?

374
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:07,942
Um, the guy makes $12.50
an hour at the Buy More.

375
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,046
You do the math, sister.

376
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:10,786
You still work
at the Buy More, Chuck?

377
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:16,643
Yes, I do.

378
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,786
You do. What about your
computer business?

379
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,731
Technically, the Buy More
offers a wide range

380
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,542
of hardware
and other things...

381
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,818
Wow, too bad Stanford
doesn't offer a BA in BS,

382
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,224
'cause you could've
graduated early.

383
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,629
Jill, please don't!
Look, I'm not--

384
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,269
it's not all a lie!

385
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,077
I can explain to you...

386
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:42,314
Charles, we did not mean
to bust your whole little...

387
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:43,418
Just go home!

388
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,650
That's it.
Attaboy, work the body!

389
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,392
Work the body, kid.
Work the body!

390
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,272
Hi, I'm Sarah,
Chuck's hot, blonde girlfriend.

391
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,913
And I'm Chuck's
smoking hot brunette.

392
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,018
Bitch.
- Slut.

393
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,225
There's only one way
to settle this.

394
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,599
Pillow fight!
- Pillow fight!

395
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,077
Okay, so how's everyone
coming with the chest...?

396
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,518
You're a dirty girl.

397
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:05,689
Come on, guys.

398
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,230
What's wrong with you?

399
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,671
I drink too much.

400
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:10,748
My parents had
impossible standards.

401
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,623
Well, let's get serious.

402
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,399
How do you expect to pass
the exam tomorrow?

403
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,873
Exam? Come again?

404
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,113
Emmett didn't tell you about

405
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,486
the written part
of the test?

406
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:19,893
Man, if I wanted
to take tests,

407
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:21,366
I would've been
a boat captain.

408
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,845
So what happens
if we don't pass?

409
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:25,286
We get lousy jobs
and live a small,

410
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,764
under-realized life
in the Valley, oh, scary.

411
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,014
Or you can take

412
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,756
the 30-hour remedial course,

413
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:35,167
unpaid,
and on your own time.

414
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:39,086
Oh, that seemed
to get their attention.

415
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,560
Doctor...

416
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,680
Hot, hot...

417
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,041
Am I supposed to ignore you

418
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,017
or can I ask you a series
of personal questions

419
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,257
that you have to answer?

420
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,037
You were right.

421
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,482
You're always right.

422
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,530
I never should've gone out
with Jill last night.

423
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:10,942
Chuck, maybe I overreacted.

424
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,684
You know? Maybe there
was a reason

425
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:13,823
to go to dinner
with Jill.

426
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,301
Yeah, to humiliate myself.

427
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:16,403
Come on,
the way things ended

428
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,484
with you guys,
you've always had a million

429
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:22,064
questions and no answers,
and now you finally got some.

430
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:23,537
So what?

431
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:25,949
What good did it do me to go
poking around in my past?

432
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,992
Because maybe now,

433
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,064
without all
that wondering

434
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:30,370
and what-iffing,
you can finally

435
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:31,978
close that chapter of your life.

436
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,161
Right again.

437
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,314
New York steak, medium rare.

438
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,419
Room 1104.

439
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,228
Guy just ordered room service.

440
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:44,205
Hmm...

441
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:46,182
Easy, easy, hey.

442
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,425
I come in peace.
- What the hell are you doing here?

443
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,302
I thought I'd swing by
and, you know,

444
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,478
check up on Jill;
make sure she's doing all right.

445
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:54,053
She's fine, Chuck.

446
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,828
She came home last night and she
hasn't left her room since.

447
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,771
Wait, wait-- shh!

448
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,882
She's making a call.

449
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:01,590
Hello?

450
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:03,298
Damn, bug's on the fritz.

451
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:04,639
We need a new one.

452
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:06,213
I'll go in as housekeeping
and plant another.

453
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:07,452
She might recognize you

454
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,759
as the waitress
from the restaurant.

455
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,065
I'll just tranq her.

456
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,941
She'll wake up in an hour,
thinking nothing of it.

457
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:13,448
Whoa, whoa,
whoa-- hey, hey.

458
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:14,520
I'll go. I'll go.

459
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,228
I'll apologize for last night,

460
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:17,836
she'll tell me what a giant
loser I am,

461
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:19,645
and I'll plant the new bug;
no tranqing necessary.

462
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:22,995
You know where
it goes, Chuck?

463
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,201
One button
on the bottom,

464
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:26,679
click on, click off.

465
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,454
All right.

466
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:31,369
I'm going in.

467
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,044
I'm going in.

468
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:34,953
Allow me between
six and eight minutes

469
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,064
to get in,
grab the test and get out.

470
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:38,303
Are you guys ready?

471
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:39,508
I was born ready.

472
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,217
I was born premature.

473
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,126
Showtime.

474
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:53,779
Hey.

475
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:55,118
Chuck's not here, sorry.

476
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:56,190
No-no-no-no-no
we know.

477
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:57,296
We know, we know,
Elizabeth.

478
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,071
That's why we're here,
to talk to you

479
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:01,047
<i>about Chuck.</i>

480
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:08,718
Awesome's bag.

481
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:18,935
Has Charles been
acting a little, um...

482
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:21,414
strange lately?

483
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:23,926
No. No more than usual, why?

484
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:27,007
We think Chuck
might have rabies.

485
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,415
All the signs
are there:

486
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:29,821
bouts of confusion,

487
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,999
general edginess,
and at lunch,

488
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,941
Jeff here thought
he saw some foam

489
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,818
around his mouth.

490
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:39,368
Okay, I appreciate the concern.

491
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:40,607
Good-bye.

492
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:44,862
Oh, no.

493
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,059
Looking for something?

494
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:55,313
You didn't think I'd leave this
in my bag, did you?

495
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:56,954
Honey, you won't
believe what I just...

496
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:01,275
Morgan, are you
holding my underwear?

497
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,084
Wait a second, wait a second.

498
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:05,228
Wait, I-I need to be
very clear about this.

499
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:06,735
Okay, the only
thing I came

500
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:08,879
in here to steal was
a CPR test.

501
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:11,358
So any suggestions
to anything pervy-related

502
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:12,564
to your panties...

503
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,344
panties--
underpants

504
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:18,325
is, frankly, outrageous.

505
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:19,933
So you deny being a perv,

506
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,776
but you admit
to being a thief?

507
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:22,914
Do I at least get points
for honesty?

508
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:31,322
Who is it?

509
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,073
It's the lying,
yet well-meaning fool

510
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:36,849
who rented a Ferrari
last night.

511
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:39,060
Ten bucks says she doesn't
open the door for him.

512
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:40,199
Make it $20 and you're on.

513
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:44,285
I don't want to talk
to you, Chuck.

514
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:45,290
Okay, well, then,

515
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,635
I'll do all the talking.

516
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:50,047
I know this may come
as a shock to you,

517
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:54,066
but I'm here to do something
totally crazy

518
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:56,344
and tell you the truth.

519
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,929
I still work
at the Buy More

520
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:02,039
and, uh, I still live
with my sister,

521
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:04,819
and I still have no idea
what I'm doing with my life.

522
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:06,862
I guess I just wanted you
to think

523
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,576
I was someone special, so...

524
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:13,595
in order to accomplish that,
I went out and got a new suit

525
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:15,404
and rented a car
that I clearly

526
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,482
have no idea
how to drive,

527
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:20,764
because from the second
I saw you again,

528
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:24,147
I knew that I hadn't
gotten over you yet, Jill.

529
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:31,383
Really?

530
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,593
You haven't gotten over me?

531
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,340
No.

532
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,136
Get in here.

533
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:47,997
Sorry about the mess.

534
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,270
Still working on the lecture.

535
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:50,175
Yeah, you
were starting

536
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:51,782
to say last night...

537
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,160
infectious disease or something.

538
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,941
I don't know, it sounded
like you were speaking Aramaic.

539
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,649
Not Aramaic.

540
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:01,061
Simple biochem 101.

541
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,200
Oh, right.

542
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:04,612
You slept through that class
in college.

543
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,420
Lot of good that would do me
in my current line of work.

544
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,101
Stop it!

545
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:10,541
Stop what?

546
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,684
Stop underselling
yourself, Chuck.

547
00:23:12,753 --> 00:23:15,063
There was a part
of last night,

548
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:17,508
somewhere after getting
minor whiplash in your car

549
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:18,747
and before abandoning you

550
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,757
on the side of the road,
where I had a really,

551
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:23,403
really nice time.

552
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:26,418
Really?

553
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:29,835
Yes... so no more lies.

554
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:32,381
No more
deception, okay?

555
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:40,855
No more lies, no more deception.

556
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:42,899
Good.

557
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:45,411
Do you know how much
I missed doing this?

558
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,890
Missed doing what?

559
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,754
What happened?

560
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,998
Huh? Oh.

561
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:12,611
Yeah, no, it was...
it was great, fine.

562
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:14,487
We really connected.

563
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,826
She's talking
about the bug, moron.

564
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:17,032
Oh, that.

565
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,372
Yes, of course, that,
I planted it.

566
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,813
It is planted.

567
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:22,961
I may have turned it off,
though-- I'm not...

568
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,301
Why would you do that?

569
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,278
Relax, these things are
pretty much idiot-proof.

570
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,354
If it's in the room, it
picks up the signal.

571
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,676
It worked,
we're tapped in

572
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:33,882
to her cell and
the room phone.

573
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,891
Why are you smiling like that?

574
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,332
She kissed me.

575
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,423
No spy stuff, no lies, just me.

576
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:56,559
Oh! Uh, that dude is some kind

577
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,536
of an assassin--
his code name

578
00:24:58,604 --> 00:24:59,674
is Wolf Den.

579
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:01,416
11-- that's Guy's floor.

580
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:03,359
Chuck...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

581
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:05,167
Stay in the van.
- Don't touch anything.

582
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:06,172
Ow!

583
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:13,106
Room service, sir.

584
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:14,682
Just put it over here.

585
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:28,984
Hello?

586
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:30,124
Hey, it's Jill.

587
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:31,363
How are you
after last night?

588
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:32,971
I'm doing great, Shari.

589
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:34,780
You're not gonna
believe who came

590
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,492
to my room to apologize tonight.

591
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:39,703
Please tell me you didn't
let that loser in.

592
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,077
Well, he looked
like a puppy dog.

593
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:42,383
I couldn't say no.

594
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:44,393
And... I still think
he's kind of cute.

595
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,967
Cute?
He's a computer dork

596
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:47,207
that makes
ten bucks an hour.

597
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:48,212
Hello...

598
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,317
it's $12.50.

599
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:50,590
Chuck?

600
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:51,896
Chuck, are you
on my phone?

601
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:55,347
Uh, Jill, is that you?

602
00:25:55,414 --> 00:25:56,653
Why are you on my phone?

603
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,059
I don't know, I don't know.

604
00:25:58,128 --> 00:25:59,400
It's so... it's...

605
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:01,309
I tried calling you, so I...

606
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:04,056
I think our... our wires
got crossed or something.

607
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,133
Is this a party line?

608
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:08,477
What did you do to my phone?
Did you bug it or something?

609
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:11,325
Bug it? What... what am I,
an entomologist?

610
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:12,598
No, you're...

611
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:13,837
you're talking crazy jargon.

612
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,613
I'm calling security.

613
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,891
Oh, oh, oh.

614
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,639
It's bolted on the inside.

615
00:26:41,707 --> 00:26:42,645
Go.

616
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,254
Clear.

617
00:26:58,322 --> 00:26:59,527
Chuck, Guy is not in his room.

618
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,245
I know.

619
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,753
Let it all out.

620
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,505
Thank you.

621
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,382
I feel terrible.

622
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,634
Maybe I should
go in there

623
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:14,718
and console her.

624
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,720
She can't know
you're a spy, Chuck.

625
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,722
Of course, she'll just
think I'm a stalker.

626
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,057
She doesn't think
you're a stalker.

627
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:26,772
So...

628
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,776
Why do you think Guy was killed?

629
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,237
What is this place?

630
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,239
Why was I blindfolded?

631
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,824
It's a secret
CIA compound.

632
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,742
We've been watching you
for days, Ms. Roberts.

633
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:40,619
Watching me? Why?

634
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:41,787
We thought
your boss, Guy,

635
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,956
was into some shady business.

636
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,375
We kept an eye on you, as well.

637
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,835
To protect you.

638
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,259
That's my ex-boyfriend, Chuck.

639
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,427
Is he involved in this?

640
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,763
He's been acting
really weird lately.

641
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,431
One minute,
he's completely normal.

642
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:02,933
The next, he's acting
like total lunatic.

643
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,059
She didn't
say stalker.

644
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,227
Almost like a stalker.

645
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:10,065
Yeah, it can be a pattern
with these losers.

646
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:13,110
A pretty girl smiles at them,
they get all infatuated.

647
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,612
Seen it a
million times.

648
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,614
No.

649
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,575
He wasn't involved.

650
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,827
Your boss, Guy, however...

651
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,121
Maybe Guy was involved,
but not how you think.

652
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,000
Guy had discovered
an antiviral serum

653
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,626
for a strain of influenza

654
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,128
used in a bioweapon,

655
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,130
an airborne influenza so deadly

656
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,507
it could kill a person
within one hour if exposed.

657
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,134
Now, a couple
of days ago,

658
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,677
Guy learned that
our company

659
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,388
secretly sells
the influenza bioweapon.

660
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,848
That's why Guy
planned to present

661
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,641
our research at the convention,

662
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,769
so that the company couldn't
cover it up any more.

663
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,688
I guess it's up to me
to do that now.

664
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,606
No, no, no, no,

665
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,440
no, no, no, no.

666
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,067
So, you'll do the
presentation...

667
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,195
No, it's too
dangerous, Casey!

668
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,948
Um, your window's knocking.

669
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,158
Excuse me.

670
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:05,829
What?

671
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:07,372
Jill is not going
to the conference.

672
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:08,373
The assassin
will kl her.

673
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:09,374
It's our only chance,

674
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,918
the only way
to smoke him out.

675
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,377
It is too dangerous
for her, all right?

676
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,295
I am putting my foot down.

677
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,672
Gingerly.

678
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,883
Look, Bartowski,
my job is to look after

679
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,259
all the citizens
of this nation,

680
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,220
not just the girl
that raises your flag.

681
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,387
Sarah...

682
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,014
please, we can't
use Jill as bait

683
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,308
and risk her life
giving that presentation.

684
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,769
Fine, I'll give
the presentation.

685
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,734
Where's Chuck?

686
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,361
Jeff, he will be here, okay?

687
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,404
And as long
as we play this cool,

688
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,531
we can cheat
off of Chuck,

689
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:41,573
and he'll never know,
all right.

690
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,408
He knows the CPR stuff
inside and out.

691
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,160
Yeah, but Morgan,
if he doesn't show,

692
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,787
we are in...
- If who doesn't show?

693
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,290
Oh, let me guess: the
perennially tardy Chuck.

694
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:51,917
Hi, hi,
sorry I'm late.

695
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,585
Oh, you're right
on time, bro.

696
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,676
Hey.

697
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,222
Yeah, no problem.

698
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,310
That was interesting.

699
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,312
You have one hour
to take the test.

700
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,272
You may begin...

701
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,109
...now.

702
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,002
Oh, no, that's
not right.

703
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,254
No, of course not.

704
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,515
Anything?

705
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,394
It's all good so far.

706
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,399
Please take your seats.

707
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,193
Giving the presentation

708
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:02,321
for Dr. Lafleur
will be... his associate

709
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:05,991
coming from Sydney, Australia.
Dr. Eva Anderson.

710
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,203
Thank you.

711
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,540
Yes, g'day,
I'm Dr. Eva Anderson,

712
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,501
and I'm here to talk
to you all today

713
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,503
about a deadly poison
that could change

714
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,254
the course of human science.

715
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:20,756
I'm honored to stand

716
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,634
before you all today
on behalf of Dr. Lafleur.

717
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:27,054
Throughout the many years
of our research...

718
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,973
Um, excuse me,
I've got to go to the loo.

719
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,982
Seal the room, seal the room!

720
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,611
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an NSA emergency.

721
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:46,073
No one-- I repeat, no one--
gets in or out.

722
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,044
Sorry, sorry.

723
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,714
Oh, um, I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

724
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,049
This could be
an important call.

725
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:07,135
Oh, I'm sorry,
and this isn't important?

726
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,346
There is no leaving the room
during the test.

727
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,306
Casey, hey,
everything okay?

728
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,891
Our Wolf Den friend
released the poison.

729
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,184
Sarah got out.

730
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:15,561
I'm still in here
with the scientists.

731
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,812
Hazmat crews are on their way.

732
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,188
We have an hour, maybe less.

733
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,481
You gotta get to Jill.

734
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:20,816
See if she has an antidote.

735
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,067
Um, I... I really don't

736
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,694
think she wants
to see me right now.

737
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,071
Chuck, we're dying here.

738
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:29,158
I don't care what you have
to say or do, just get it done.

739
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,412
Gotta go, good luck.

740
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,584
I guess someone
doesn't think

741
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,585
saving lives
is important.

742
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,095
Jill, it's Chuck,
you have to open the door!

743
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:51,471
Go away, Chuck!

744
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,514
This isn't funny
anymore.

745
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,016
Look, it's an emergency, okay?

746
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,726
I know that my credibility
with you is at an all-time low

747
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,436
but you need to listen to me.

748
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,438
The bioweapon has been released
at the conference center.

749
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,648
How do you know
about the virus?

750
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:03,108
Because, Jill...

751
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,361
...I'm a CIA agent.

752
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,323
Oh, my God, Chuck, you really
need to get some help.

753
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,950
I am the help.

754
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,452
Don't believe anything else
that I've told you,

755
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,496
but believe this. We have to get
them the antidote right now.

756
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,663
I'm going to call the police,
Chuck.

757
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,373
I've already taken the liberty.

758
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:19,750
Have a look for yourself.

759
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,297
Oh, my God.

760
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,260
You are telling the truth.

761
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,138
Hold on.

762
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,641
She's pretty cute, right?

763
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,726
We used to date.

764
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,436
Okay.
Okay.

765
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:40,646
Look, just stay close,
don't be scared.

766
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,233
All right, people, wheels up.

767
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,151
Let's move!

768
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,371
Hey!

769
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:58,705
Who's in charge here?

770
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:59,581
I am.

771
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,708
Not anymore.

772
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,585
Thank you.

773
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,171
Casey, it's Chuck.

774
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,673
I'm with Jill.
What's your status?

775
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,592
By my time,
we got about 15 minutes.

776
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:12,094
I have to go in there.

777
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:15,055
Okay, I need a Level A
Hazmat suit right now.

778
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:16,181
We don't have
those suits yet.

779
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:17,975
CDC will be here
in ten minutes.

780
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:18,976
We don't have ten minutes.

781
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,060
I'll go in without one.

782
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:22,938
No. You? No.

783
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,147
It's too dangerous.
I'll do it.

784
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,816
Chuck, whoever goes in there

785
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,860
has to be able to make
the antidote. That's me.

786
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,319
Well, is it something
you could talk me through?

787
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:30,696
I guess.

788
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,197
Okay, well,
then I'm going in.

789
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,574
No, Chuck, wait!

790
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:35,909
Are you sure?

791
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,578
Yeah.

792
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,246
I'm sure.

793
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:40,831
Okay.

794
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,082
Okay, uh....

795
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:43,709
I'm going to have to
inject you first.

796
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:46,545
Uh...

797
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:48,755
Oh, that's a big needle.

798
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,549
Ready?
- Yeah.

799
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,009
Yeah...

800
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,302
Okay, that has
a modified

801
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:54,511
version of the viral strain.

802
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:55,929
Now your body metabolizes
the poison

803
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,222
and the antiviral
serum is going

804
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:58,390
to be created from
your blood.

805
00:34:58,473 --> 00:34:59,558
Poison? Poison?!

806
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:00,726
I thought I was getting
the antidote?

807
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:01,810
You just gave me poison?!

808
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,061
Yeah.

809
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,855
It's the only way to
make the antidote.

810
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,648
Did you not
understand that?

811
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,858
Oh, that.

812
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,193
Of-- No, I understand
that whole part.

813
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,652
We're living on the edge.

814
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,571
Love the rush.

815
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:45,145
Oh, damn.

816
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,358
CIA?

817
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,912
Oh, no, no, no, no,
what are you doing in here?

818
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,413
It's a long story,
but the headline is

819
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,498
I'm our only hope for survival.

820
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,458
And here I thought

821
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,377
things couldn't get any worse.

822
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,838
Okay, inside the briefcase,
is a medisyringe,

823
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,506
multi-dose injector.

824
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,633
I need you to extract 60 cc's
of your own blood,

825
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,593
put it through the centrifuge,
and then inject

826
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:19,888
one cc of the antiviral serum
into each of those infected.

827
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,306
Okay, okay.

828
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,975
Casey, here-- No, no,
no, no, no, no.

829
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:24,560
Casey, you have, you
have to take the gun.

830
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:25,769
Huh?
- Take the gun. And you have to--

831
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,354
You have to take
my blood, okay?

832
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:28,897
So just take my blood.

833
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,732
Okay.

834
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,112
Okay.

835
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,530
Take the gun, Chuck.

836
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:37,531
Take the gun, Chuck.
- Huh?

837
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:38,824
What?
- Take the gun.

838
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,492
Take the...

839
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,161
Oh, God.

840
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:44,079
Chuck, what's happening?

841
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,497
I need-- I need help

842
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:46,623
right now.
Casey's fading fast!

843
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:47,499
The just gun dropped!

844
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,542
And it shattered!

845
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,960
That was the only syringe!

846
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:52,087
Okay, uh, stay calm.

847
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:53,130
I'm-I'm going
to find another.

848
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:55,382
Jill, please hurry.

849
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,384
We're running out of time.

850
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,679
Oh, time's running out,
gentlemen.

851
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:02,055
You have one minute left.

852
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,932
Oh! And I see
you have yet

853
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,517
to attempt the Heimlich
section.

854
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,186
Interesting.

855
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:48,519
Oh, good Lord!

856
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:50,145
I think Jeff
is choking!

857
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,356
Someone should do the-the
Heimlich or something!

858
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:54,316
Jeff, Jeff,
can you speak?

859
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:55,526
Are you choking?

860
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,027
Okay, on your feet.

861
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,654
On your feet!

862
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,155
All right, on the
count of three

863
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,824
I'm going to do an inward
and upward thrust.

864
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,158
Two inches above your
belly button.

865
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,661
One, two, three!

866
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,871
Repeat four times.

867
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,544
Oh, yes!

868
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:15,671
Done!

869
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:19,424
What are we gonna do, Casey?

870
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,759
Think of something.

871
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,094
You're smart.

872
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,887
You went to Stanford.

873
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,514
Sort of.

874
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,391
Ugh, God!

875
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,017
Cover your mouth.

876
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:30,185
That's disgusting!

877
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:33,647
That's it!

878
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,860
Hey, hey, this is gonna
sound crazy, but-but

879
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:38,986
viruses are spread
airborne, right?

880
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,237
Yeah.
- I mean, you catch them

881
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,613
when someone sneezes. Coughs.
- Yeah.

882
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:44,616
Well, maybe the antivirals
metabolize in saliva.

883
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,577
What are you talking about?

884
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:52,082
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

885
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,125
What?

886
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,043
No, no!

887
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,503
No, no, no, no.

888
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,297
I served my country with
honor, Bartowski.

889
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,381
Please.

890
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,300
Let me die with
my dignity.

891
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:05,554
Chuck?

892
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,891
Jill!
- What are you doing?

893
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,934
Jill, Jill, hey.

894
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:13,228
I thought that-- I thought
that maybe the antivirals

895
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:15,522
could be spread
by saliva.

896
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,733
That's ridiculous.

897
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:19,985
No wonder
you failed biochem.

898
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,612
From the deepest recesses

899
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,654
of my soul, I'm sorry.

900
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,327
Oh, here we go again.

901
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,632
Okay, you take
half the room,

902
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:42,758
I'll take the other.
One cc each.

903
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:43,967
Okay? Hurry.

904
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,053
Okay, okay. Casey, Casey.

905
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,513
Ah.

906
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,862
Way to go, Agent Carmichael!

907
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,411
Chuck!

908
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:12,871
You're amazing.

909
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:14,873
Nah.

910
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,750
Well, maybe a little.

911
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,270
<i>Jill Roberts</i>

912
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,563
now knows Chuck's an asset.

913
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:38,981
What do you want us
to do about it?

914
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,399
I want you to do nothing.

915
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:43,193
The assassin Agent Walker shot
was a member of Fulcrum.

916
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,778
A rogue CIA agent.

917
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,573
We don't know the extent
of their penetration.

918
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,867
If Jill knows something
they may make a play for her.

919
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,494
So, you want to use her as bait?

920
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,497
General, uh, Chuck has real
feelings for Jill.

921
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:58,083
I don't think he'd approve of us
using her like this.

922
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,294
That's why you're not going
to tell him, Agent Walker.

923
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:05,465
Wow.

924
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,925
That's something I haven't seen
in a while.

925
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,093
What, this--

926
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:09,261
I wear this like
four times a week.

927
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:10,554
No, your smile.

928
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,389
You look happy.

929
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:13,390
Yeah.

930
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:14,516
Yeah, that.

931
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,517
That thing.

932
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,269
Um, I don't know.

933
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:18,770
I guess, uh,

934
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:20,189
I found some of
those answers

935
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:21,565
that you said I was
looking for.

936
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,525
Well, thank God.

937
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,652
I am so relieved.

938
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:28,155
I just think that,
you know, Sarah--

939
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,115
There's really something
special about her.

940
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,451
I think that you had
to go through all that stuff

941
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,995
with Jill so you could figure
out who the one is for you.

942
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,246
And now that
you found her

943
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,623
you'll stop
wondering

944
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:38,999
about somebody else.

945
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,297
Take it.

946
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:46,298
Tell Sarah I said hi.

947
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,177
Hey.

948
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,095
How's my favorite secret agent?

949
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,097
Um... good.

950
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,432
Yeah, good.

951
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:57,184
I just-- I have to study

952
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,645
for a CPR test for my day job
at the Buy More.

953
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,231
I could use some help
with the mouth-to-mouth.

954
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:03,815
Well, what about your cover
girlfriend?

955
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,025
Won't she be jealous?

956
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,485
No.

957
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:08,612
No, our-our relationship's
a cover, you know.

958
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,364
There's nothing
to be jealous about.

959
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,740
So everything...

960
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:13,826
it's all fake.

961
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,245
That sounds really lonely,
Chuck.

962
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:18,372
Yeah, it is.

963
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,374
But...

964
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:23,585
but now that you're here maybe
we can have something real.

965
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,546
Us. Together.

966
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,381
I like the sound of that.

967
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:29,007
So about that
mouth-to-mouth...

968
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,468
