1
00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:03,419
I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things you might need to know.

2
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:05,621
Did you know there is an undercover
DEA agent out in the courtyard?

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,322
I knew it was you.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,258
- Your cover?
- Carina.

5
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:10,559
It's beautiful.

6
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:11,960
My mom's charm bracelet.

7
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:13,394
We could run together.

8
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:14,762
We have to go, Chuck. This is it.

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,430
- Are you coming?
- I can't.

10
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,799
Sarah, they wanted me to be a spy.

11
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:21,001
Really important people told me that
they thought I could change the world.

12
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:24,637
I acted impulsively, and
it won't happen again.

13
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:26,443
You're a spy now, Chuck.

14
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,811
You have to keep your
feelings to yourself.

15
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:05,445
Yeah, can I call you back?

16
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,680
I'm just in the middle
of something at work.

17
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:10,082
Yeah, me, too.

18
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,852
I love you, too, smooshy.

19
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,336
God, it feels like I haven't
been off duty in years.

20
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:36,872
How long you in town for anyway?

21
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,373
I plan on getting out quick.

22
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:41,242
Los Angeles has all the cultural
panache of a Porta Potti.

23
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,710
I've missed you.

24
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:48,048
So, why are you still here?

25
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,716
How long can you
possibly have to protect

26
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,051
some doofus at a stereo store?

27
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,153
You know, I don't really
want to talk about work.

28
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,990
Ah, so you're sleeping with him.

29
00:01:56,057 --> 00:02:00,125
We have a very
professional relationship.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,560
Oh.

31
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:05,462
What?

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,996
Nothing.

33
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,765
You're just really into him, that's all.

34
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:10,199
Can we please not talk about Chuck?

35
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,401
Oh, my God, Walker.

36
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,568
What?

37
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:15,403
You broke the cardinal rule of spying,

38
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:17,705
didn't you?

39
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,478
You're breaking the cardinal
rule of getting dumped.

40
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,480
Can we please talk about
something other than Sarah?

41
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,981
Yeah. Good, except you're moping, man.

42
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,349
I am not moping.

43
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,584
Hey, hey, what the
hell are we doing here?

44
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,919
Could you at least pause the game?

45
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,020
I know you're upset about Sarah,

46
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,754
but there is no pause button on life.

47
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,056
See what I'm trying to say?

48
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,858
We are two very, very sexy bachelors

49
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,226
with the world at our fingertips.

50
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,395
Our lives are incredible.

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,861
Yeah, incredibly average to sub-par.

52
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:50,030
Look, all I'm saying is,
there's gotta be, what,

53
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,065
two million ladies
in the City of Angels?

54
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:55,635
They can't all say no to us.

55
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,145
Target rich, Chuck!

56
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:08,214
Hello.

57
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,017
Oh, here we go. Thirsty, ladies?

58
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,586
Cosmo, Pina colada, mai tai,
rum and coke, gin and tonic?

59
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,253
Well-hydrated already,
well-hydrated, okay.

60
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,054
Buddy, I... I don't, I don't
really know if I'm ready for this.

61
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,555
Look, dude, no one's
asking you to fall in love.

62
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:21,890
Okay, we're just here
to have you, you know,

63
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,125
forget about Sarah for a little while.

64
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,426
That's all.

65
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:25,560
Oh, my God, it's Sarah!

66
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,095
What?!

67
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:28,430
Wh... what do you mean, Sarah? My Sarah?

68
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:29,997
Technically, she's single
if you think about it,

69
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:32,265
you know, so, yes, your Sarah.

70
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:35,667
And she's with Carina.

71
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,971
You think she'd remember me?

72
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,406
We did only go on that
one date, and very tall

73
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:42,440
women have very short memories.

74
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,608
You know what, okay, I'm gonna

75
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:45,977
go and do a little spy work, buddy.

76
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:48,912
- Yeah, yeah.
- So, you go and get some drinks,

77
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,213
and I'll kind of suss out
the situation with Carina.

78
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:53,815
Hey!

79
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:57,085
Hi, hi, Carina, long time.

80
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,486
Wow, what a nice surprise.

81
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,254
And Sarah, good to see you tonight.

82
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,588
Sorry.

83
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,689
Chuck, what are you doing here?

84
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:03,757
Are you spying on me?

85
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:04,924
I don't, uh, no.

86
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,526
I'm just out here for
an innocent evening

87
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:07,694
with an old friend.

88
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:11,497
Yeah, we're just out here

89
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:14,098
soaking in the sights and sounds

90
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,633
and whatever the evening may bring.

91
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,101
- Great.
- Great.

92
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:17,935
- Good.
- Hey!

93
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,803
Hey, baby.

94
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:26,642
I'm so glad you're both here.

95
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,044
This way, I can tell you our
great news at the same time.

96
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,679
This is my fiance, Karl.

97
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,213
Wow.

98
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,314
Sarah Walker, my best friend.

99
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:36,316
- And Chuck, her boyfriend.
- Chuck.

100
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,820
That's right, Chuck the
boyfriend, that's me.

101
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:42,355
Glad to meet you guys, it really is.

102
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:43,522
Yeah, yeah. You, too!

103
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,890
Nice to meet you. Yeah, that's crazy.

104
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,524
It's so nice to finally put a face

105
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:49,659
to all the amazing stories
that we've heard for so long.

106
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,227
- Right, so long.
- Or short.

107
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,494
Depending on the length
of your courtship.

108
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:53,962
It is really great to meet you.

109
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,197
I mean, you're exactly
how Carina described you.

110
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:57,531
To the tee.

111
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,434
Thank you. Love really
has made me a better man.

112
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:02,169
What about you, Chuck?

113
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,371
What about me? Oh, love!

114
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,040
Yeah, love, love is a
powerful tonic, is it not?

115
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,074
- Oh...
- I love you,

116
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,576
- smooshy.
- I love you, smoosh.

117
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,578
I'm really sorry to
cut this short, guys,

118
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,980
but I've booked a
romantic dinner for two.

119
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,182
Go, do it, yeah.

120
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,483
So, I'll meet you at the valet?

121
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,650
Okay. I'll miss you, smoosh.

122
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,151
Miss you more, smooshy.

123
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:24,655
Okay, guys.

124
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:26,056
- Really good seeing you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

125
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:28,691
Yeah, for sure.

126
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,927
Congratulations, you
guys seem really in love.

127
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,234
Oh, Sarah, Carina,

128
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,735
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

129
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:44,536
Karl is not who you think he
is. He's a bad man, he's a...

130
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:45,437
He's an arms dealer.

131
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:48,772
Yeah, my mark.

132
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,173
What, you think I'm an idiot?

133
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,174
It's the cardinal rule:

134
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:53,542
spies don't fall in love.

135
00:05:55,577 --> 00:05:57,311
Welcome to your new mission.

136
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:14,057
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

137
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,074
Look who's back.

138
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,075
Only thing that changes are the clothes.

139
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,576
Everything's about to change, people!

140
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,279
Bet you're wondering why
I'm wearing my Sunday finery.

141
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:59,149
Because I am here to
do my finest every day.

142
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,918
Question is...

143
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:01,986
Are you?

144
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,823
Oh, that's not a rhetorical question.

145
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,058
Yes, the answer is yes.

146
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,929
Ham.

147
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:13,430
With Emmett gone, Buy More has given me

148
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,265
a second chance to manage here.

149
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:18,200
I do not take that
responsibility lightly.

150
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:20,501
I've learned much from my business class

151
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,403
at El Segundo School of Finance.

152
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,739
I intend to apply that knowledge here.

153
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:29,310
Did you know that the
Japanese have no word for "no"?

154
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:33,447
730 ways to say "yes,"
but no word for "no."

155
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:36,651
When we are selling,
we no longer understand

156
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:39,253
the meaning of the word "no."

157
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:41,456
No, Morgan.

158
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:43,357
I do not have any more intel

159
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:45,225
on the guy Carina left the club with.

160
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:47,660
Okay, but I still have
a shot here, right?

161
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,496
I mean, she can't have
real feelings for this guy?

162
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:52,765
That's a pretty safe assumption.

163
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:56,501
Who is this, uh, alleged
female you reference?

164
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,269
Just some girl.

165
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:00,104
Carina's not just some girl, okay?

166
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,739
She's basically a Swedish super-model.

167
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,941
The country's greatest
export since Bjorn Borg.

168
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:06,410
Well, people mistake
me for him all the time.

169
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:08,478
We dated a couple years ago, hooked up.

170
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:09,579
Now she's gone,

171
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:10,880
we drifted apart.

172
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,114
Eh, but she's back in town,

173
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:13,415
I'm thinking about hitting that a.

174
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:14,850
Okay.

175
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,851
There's no way that a girl
like you could ever get a woman

176
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,786
like you're describing here, it seems...

177
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:30,195
Funny though, 'cause
if she wasn't into me,

178
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:31,530
then what is she doing here?

179
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,010
Hello, ma'am, can I
help you with a computer

180
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,378
or computer-related software?

181
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:46,712
What are you doing here?

182
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,448
You're needed downstairs, Agent Romeo.

183
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:52,684
Wow, she seems really into you.

184
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:56,120
Agent Miller has been working undercover

185
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:58,522
for the CIA, playing the
girlfriend of suspected

186
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,457
arms smuggler, Karl Stromberg.

187
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,325
We've learned ten million
dollars was recently wired

188
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:03,660
into Stromberg's account.

189
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,661
We don't know what this weapon is,

190
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,563
but someone's willing to
pay a lot of money for it.

191
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,732
Well, we gotta get it before
it falls into enemy hands.

192
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,199
Thanks for being on
the case, Nancy Drew.

193
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,768
My engagement party is
today at Karl's house.

194
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,169
Sarah and Chuck will
enter as my best friend

195
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,704
and her loving boyfriend,

196
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,439
the cover that they
established at the club.

197
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,708
Mr. Bartowski, that a problem?

198
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:21,709
I'm cool.

199
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:23,343
No problemo. And Casey

200
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:24,677
will pose as my father.

201
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:28,677
Check your math, sister,
I'll play your brother.

202
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,912
That's a bit of a stretch, Colonel.

203
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,347
Yeah, Casey, uh, I
think you have dungarees

204
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:33,981
that are older than Carina.

205
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,115
Colonel, you will assume the identity

206
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,717
of Agent Miller's uncle.

207
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,886
Carina's father's much younger brother.

208
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,287
Karl's storing the weapon in a gold case

209
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,422
inside a vault room
adjacent to his bedroom.

210
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,890
During Karl's toast,

211
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,258
Sarah and Chuck will slip
out, break in and apprehend it.

212
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,826
He keeps the access key to
the secured area in his pants,

213
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:51,594
which I can easily access.

214
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:52,862
Oh, I'll bet you can.

215
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:55,197
Karl also just installed
a state-of-the-art

216
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:57,099
security system in the vault room.

217
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,868
So, I hope the two of you can
handle anything you find there.

218
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,437
Uh, "any" is kind of a broad word.

219
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:03,738
Chuck is just being modest.

220
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,340
His recent training has equipped him

221
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:07,408
to handle any security obstacle.

222
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,709
There won't be a problem.

223
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:09,810
Better not be.

224
00:10:09,878 --> 00:10:12,078
This whole mission rides on you, Chuck.

225
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,713
What a surprise.

226
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:17,251
Carina is almost six feet of pure Swede.

227
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:20,120
That's just over 182 centimeters
of Lapland, know what I mean?

228
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:22,088
Stop it, Grimes, this is pathetic.

229
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:23,456
As if a hot piece of tuchus like that

230
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,890
would get anywhere near
dirty treife like you.

231
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,623
I could totally nail
that if I wanted it.

232
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,191
If you're such a stallion, prove it.

233
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,426
Ask her out.

234
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,963
Now, listen, I know she's
kind of seeing someone, and...

235
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:38,466
Mm, I didn't see a ring
on her perfect finger.

236
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:41,335
Well, I'm slow-playing it.

237
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,236
You snooze, you lose boobs.

238
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:44,404
We checked out

239
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,338
Chuck's calendar software,

240
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,373
and we noticed that Ellie
and her pin-up husband

241
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,841
are away at some doctor
thing for a few days.

242
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,710
So, it's the perfect
time for us to throw you

243
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,145
- a housewarming party.
- Nah, I don't know...

244
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:57,147
I'll even prepare my special punch.

245
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:58,648
You'll have home field advantage.

246
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:01,751
Are you ready to say yes, lover boy?

247
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:06,254
Yes. Yes!

248
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:07,589
Of course, yes! Yes!

249
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:08,723
Carina will be there, too, by the way.

250
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,124
Party is on, nerds!

251
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,259
Party is on! Yeah!

252
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:12,960
Party! Party!

253
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,161
Party!

254
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:18,598
All right, all right. Let's
take a look here, buddy.

255
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:20,633
Uh... Look at me.

256
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,234
Hmm...

257
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:23,301
Neither.

258
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,970
Um, why are you so dressed up? A date?

259
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,171
Are you getting back
together with Sarah?

260
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:29,006
It's not a date and no.

261
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,107
Oh, well, who is this not-date with?

262
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:35,912
Huh.

263
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,780
You should answer that, maybe.

264
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:39,181
Yeah, thanks.

265
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:40,816
Hi.

266
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:43,052
Yeah. Almost out the door.

267
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:12,445
Hmm.

268
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:15,181
Here. This charm bracelet looks like

269
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:16,815
what some sucker in love might wear.

270
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,083
Hmm? Uh...

271
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:21,019
No, it's not really my thing.

272
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,090
You want to talk about
what happened with him?

273
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:31,896
When we wrap this mission,

274
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,698
maybe you should come with
me on my next assignment.

275
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:36,334
I know it's not Burbank, but, uh...

276
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,669
We can make the best of Saint-Tropez.

277
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,738
Right?

278
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:46,243
Do you ever wonder
about a different life?

279
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:47,444
You mean, like...

280
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:48,879
if all this was real?

281
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:53,483
If we were really getting
ready for my engagement party?

282
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:55,485
Yeah.

283
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:58,522
No.

284
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,592
Yeah. We're, uh, we're talking a little.

285
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:04,160
Oh, good for you.

286
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:06,395
That's good. I'm glad to hear
it. Is Cara going to be there?

287
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:07,730
Have you seen my keys?

288
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:08,898
'Cause I could come with. You know, uh,

289
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:10,533
maybe just run a comb through my beard.

290
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,767
Takes two seconds.

291
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,235
Uh, actually, it's not
that kind of a party.

292
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,537
Don't worry about it.

293
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:18,540
Do me a favor, though.
Could you get this to her?

294
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,042
Our invitation to our party.

295
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,377
Please?

296
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,882
Fine. I will give Carina your flyer

297
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,119
if you find my keys.

298
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,688
Right. Keys.

299
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:31,256
I should have known.

300
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:33,291
Mm-hmm-hmm.
Have fun.

301
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:38,764
Congratulations.

302
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:41,399
You two are going to have
the most amazing life.

303
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:42,701
You are a very lucky man, Karl.

304
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,401
Thanks, Chuck. I'm
sure you're going to be

305
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,970
next at the altar.

306
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,106
I'd be the happiest guy in the world.

307
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,374
He really would be.

308
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:54,979
Oh, sweetheart, I want to introduce you

309
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,180
to my uncle Johnny.

310
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:58,349
- Daddy's brother.
- Kid brother.

311
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,516
Good to see you.

312
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,185
It is great to finally meet

313
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:02,786
one of Carina's family.

314
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:06,256
I'm not too sure about
the... resemblance, though.

315
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:07,658
Oh, um...

316
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:08,992
Daddy and Uncle Johnny share

317
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,627
the same thick neck and square head.

318
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,264
Ooh, bacon lamb chops,
12:00. There we go.

319
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,365
Thanks.

320
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,967
Master bedroom access
point is at your 6:00.

321
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:22,370
We'll move when the room
is distracted by the toasts.

322
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:23,804
Sarah, listen.

323
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,942
I feel like there's
been this.. this thing...

324
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,277
hanging over us.

325
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,045
You know, ever since Prague, and I mean,

326
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,046
I miss you.

327
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:32,415
Will you excuse us for a second?

328
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,150
Sure.

329
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:36,619
I miss this. I miss us.

330
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,287
- Karl's on the move.
- Wait.

331
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,890
Um, I'll be right there.

332
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:42,224
Look, what I'm trying to say

333
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:43,959
is that even though we're on a mission,

334
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:45,094
it feels good

335
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,095
to hang out together,

336
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:47,397
to talk as friends.

337
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:48,932
You know, kind of like we did before.

338
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:53,203
What is he doing?

339
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,506
Well, what do you think?

340
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,842
It's just a cover, Chuck.

341
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:07,013
What the hell are you
doing to my mission?

342
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:08,815
You and Sarah are supposed
to be a happy couple.

343
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:11,149
Look, ever since I got back from Prague,

344
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:12,784
Sarah's been so cold.

345
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,252
You idiot.

346
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,254
The reason Sarah's cold
is because she loves you.

347
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:21,391
Now, get your head out of
your ass and go be a spy.

348
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:32,162
Sarah, hey.

349
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:33,597
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

350
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:35,297
Carina said something to me, and
I know it's not the best time,

351
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,531
but I really need to talk to you.

352
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,465
Okay, Chuck, we need
to focus on the mission.

353
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,601
Carina's getting the key. Come on.

354
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,840
I'll bet you know that
toast by heart now, hmm?

355
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,408
Yeah, pretty much, darling.

356
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:52,777
You're going to do great, smoosh.

357
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:55,279
Thank you, smooshy.

358
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:59,049
Oh, what did a bloke like me
do to deserve someone like you?

359
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:03,019
Okay. Should we do this?

360
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,453
Yes.

361
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,588
Let's do it.

362
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:10,759
I'd like to make a toast
to my beautiful bride-to-be.

363
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,829
Since the first time I met Carina,

364
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,263
I knew I'd found the woman

365
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:18,398
I wanted to spend the
rest of my life with.

366
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,733
I've never met anyone more real,

367
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:23,202
more honest or more good.

368
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,471
Not never.

369
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:30,942
A toast to the future Mrs. Stromberg.

370
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,743
Hear, hear.

371
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,345
I love you, smooshy.

372
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,814
I love you, smoosh.

373
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,120
Um, is that it?

374
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:50,558
Um, no. Also...

375
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:56,465
may... may our first
child be a masculine child.

376
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,766
Hear, hear.

377
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,236
Please, can we talk
for just a quick second?

378
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,905
No time.

379
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:05,272
Carina, we just got to the vault.

380
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,940
- We need more time.
- Wait!

381
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:13,245
I just know that my uncle
Johnny's dying to say something.

382
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,948
Johnny, come on.

383
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,316
All right.

384
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,123
I'm, I'm not ordinarily
a man of many words.

385
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,125
Or any words, for that matter.

386
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:29,629
But in this case, I'm
willing to make an exception.

387
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:33,366
I remember when I first
set eyes on sweet Carina.

388
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:36,135
I was practically just a boy

389
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:38,804
when my big brother brought home

390
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:42,508
the most beautiful
baby girl in the world.

391
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,287
No way.

392
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:59,256
I'm so proud of the woman
that Carina has become.

393
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:02,192
So beautiful, so giving.

394
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,361
So warm and kind.

395
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:07,997
Approachable. So good at conversation.

396
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:11,467
And all of those qualities
are reflected in the man

397
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:15,138
that she's chose to be her life partner.

398
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,975
Sarah, there's no way. I can't
get around all these beams

399
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:20,544
without setting the alarm
off. It's impossible.

400
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,046
Okay, you can do this.
The Intersect can do this.

401
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,981
Just focus and don't
ink of anything else.

402
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,683
Just relax.

403
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,618
Okay.

404
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,922
Relax. Okay.

405
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,064
I'm not flashing, Sarah.

406
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:41,033
Maybe if we could just talk

407
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,267
- for a second...
- Okay, Chuck.

408
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,636
I am right here, and we can talk

409
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:45,970
about whatever you want
to talk about later.

410
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:48,573
We just have to get our
hands on that weapon first.

411
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,875
We'll talk, I promise.

412
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,634
Okay. Now we can talk.

413
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:58,371
Oh, no! Damn it.

414
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:00,039
And I just know that if my brother

415
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:01,807
were still alive today, that...

416
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,178
Well...

417
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,448
He'd want to say,
"Welcome to the family."

418
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,651
And, "Take care of our little girl."

419
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,683
Don't worry, Uncle Johnny.

420
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,248
Deep breaths. Let it all out.

421
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,248
Yeah.

422
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,252
I don't like small spaces!

423
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,986
Just keep breathing, Chuck.

424
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:24,987
You're going to be fine.

425
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:31,059
Gas, gas, gas! There's gas in here!

426
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:33,161
Sarah, I'll be taking
exclusively short breaths

427
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:34,395
from here on out!

428
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,002
Okay. Hold on, Chuck. I'm
going to get you out of there.

429
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,078
Sarah!

430
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,313
Sarah, I don't want to regret

431
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:53,748
not telling you everything
I need to tell you.

432
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:56,750
Look, I'm... I'm not a normal spy.

433
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:58,118
You know that. I know that.

434
00:20:58,186 --> 00:21:01,018
I'm a... I'm a regular guy
who works at a Buy More.

435
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,784
And the decision that
I made in Prague...

436
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,653
I know what it looks like.

437
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:10,121
I know that it looks
like I chose being a spy

438
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,823
over being with you, but
that's not what happened.

439
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:16,293
How I felt about you was real.

440
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,094
Very, very real.

441
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:22,565
And I know that you know how...

442
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:24,666
how I felt about you for a long time.

443
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,901
You know that when Carina
told me what you said...

444
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:31,672
Those three words that I've
waited to hear for so long...

445
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,907
Look, Sarah, I know...

446
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,609
I know you were probably kind of hurt...

447
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,211
You were probably hurt

448
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,480
that I didn't run away
with you in Prague.

449
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,554
A toast... to Karl and Carina.

450
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:54,589
Their love is an inspiration to us all.

451
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:56,357
Hear, hear.

452
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,225
Sarah...

453
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,394
I love you.

454
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:13,889
Good job recovering the weapon.

455
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,824
How is the asset doing?

456
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:16,958
He'll live.

457
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,259
What is this thing, General?

458
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:21,195
I've never seen a weapon like it before.

459
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:24,398
That information is above
your pay grade, Colonel Casey.

460
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:26,734
Agent Miller will return it to Langley

461
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:28,535
on her way out to her next assignment.

462
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:30,304
You never saw it.

463
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,642
They wouldn't tell me either.

464
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:40,413
Hey, Walker.

465
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:42,482
I'm leaving tonight

466
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,683
for Saint-Tropez.

467
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:46,053
Did you think about my offer?

468
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:48,088
I'm still considering it.

469
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,801
Agent Walker?

470
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:03,336
everything okay?

471
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:04,471
It's about Chuck's safety.

472
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:07,440
I thought he just needed some sleep.

473
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:09,442
Well, it's about me managing Chuck

474
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:11,143
and keeping his emotions in check

475
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,778
so that the Intersect can work.

476
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:13,913
I'm beginning to think I'm more

477
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,181
a part of the problem than the solution.

478
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:16,782
And I think a different agent

479
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,150
might have more success

480
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:19,285
in training him.

481
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:21,053
Let me be clear, Agent Walker.

482
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:24,490
I don't know or want to know
what happened between you two.

483
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:27,526
But this is your job, and
Chuck's safety depends on you.

484
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:30,562
So get over it and teach
him how to be a real spy.

485
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:40,370
Well, time to train, Chuck.

486
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:42,840
Let's go.

487
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:46,476
Lives are on the line.

488
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:48,645
We need to get the 2.0 working right.

489
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:50,947
If you want to be a real
spy, you need to act like one.

490
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,183
I am a real spy.

491
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,553
A real spy

492
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,622
would have flashed on the Bo.

493
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,190
Been able to defend himself.

494
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:06,861
Come on, Chuck. The program

495
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:08,529
is in the 2.0. You can do this.

496
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:10,330
It doesn't work, okay? It's not working.

497
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:12,032
I'm, I'm, I'm too emotional.

498
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,868
But if we could just talk really quick.

499
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,603
You need to learn to
ignore your emotions.

500
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,637
Spies do not have feelings.

501
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,072
Feelings get you killed.

502
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,541
You need to learn to bury
them in a place deep inside.

503
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,347
Sarah, stop.

504
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,352
Come on, flash! Show
me your attack skills!

505
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:36,722
Come on, Chuck, flash! Show me!

506
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,560
- No.
- Why not?!

507
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:45,396
Because I don't want to hurt you.

508
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:52,803
Don't worry, Chuck, you can't.

509
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:07,914
Yeah, I've been
tracking her all morning.

510
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:09,682
She's in Burbank.

511
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,317
Hey, buddy, seeing as how you
didn't come home last night,

512
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,985
I'll assume everything
went great with Sarah.

513
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:15,019
Nice work. Nice.

514
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:16,453
Listen, I need to know

515
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,187
if you gave the flyer to Carina, though,

516
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:19,888
'cause I really need her to this party.

517
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:21,356
My whole reputation is at stake here.

518
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:23,124
Charles can't save you
from this lie, Morgan,

519
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:24,992
not this time.

520
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,561
A humiliation like this will
leave a deep lasting scar.

521
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:29,764
I know.

522
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:32,805
Hmm. Hmm.

523
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,446
That the girl you fancy, son?

524
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:43,849
"Fancy" is not a big enough word.

525
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,918
I don't think she's gonna age to come

526
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:47,419
to this party, though.

527
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:51,156
And I, uh, I exaggerated
about my relationship

528
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:52,224
with Carina to the guys.

529
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,860
And truth is...

530
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,395
I don't think she even
knows my real name.

531
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:58,997
Fine fish like that don't swim

532
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:00,731
in a man like yours' ocean very often.

533
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:02,065
Question is, are you gonna toss

534
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:03,766
your hook in the water or cut bait?

535
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:08,571
Remember, 730 words in the
Japanese language for "yes."

536
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:10,173
You just need her to say one.

537
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,809
Right, right. Thank you so much.

538
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:15,145
- Thank you.
- Martin...

539
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:16,813
I need a favor.

540
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,315
My laptop broke.

541
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:20,250
Would you give this to Chuck?

542
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,391
On one condition, okay?

543
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,761
You come to my party.

544
00:26:30,828 --> 00:26:32,829
Fine. Whatever.

545
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:35,031
Just promise you'll give it to Chuck.

546
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:52,749
Smooshy...

547
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:54,350
you haven't been returning my calls.

548
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:56,886
I was starting to think
you've been getting cold feet.

549
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:00,856
What's going on, Smoosh?

550
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:06,528
Last night somebody stole
something very valuable from me.

551
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:10,332
Now I'm thinking you're
not who you say you are.

552
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
I'm thinking

553
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:12,935
you're a spy.

554
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:14,770
A spy?

555
00:27:14,837 --> 00:27:16,104
Well, that's ridiculous.

556
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:18,140
It's me, Smoosh.

557
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:20,542
I love you!

558
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:25,680
I'm not like Carina,
some coldhearted spy

559
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:27,048
who throws around words like "love."

560
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:30,819
I'm gonna kill you, Chuck Bartowski.

561
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:33,054
No, Carina, I'm gonna kill Chuck.

562
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:34,655
But don't worry, Smooshy,

563
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:35,923
you're next.

564
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,371
Good news, buddy.

565
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,406
- Your girl is here.
- She is?

566
00:27:57,474 --> 00:27:58,374
Mm-hmm.

567
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:00,042
Of course she is.

568
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,177
What did I tell you, huh?

569
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:03,345
Right.

570
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:18,819
And she showed up

571
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:21,524
with four guys and no beer.

572
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:22,726
Thanks a lot.

573
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:24,761
Now our party's a sausage fest.

574
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:29,866
Loo... ser.

575
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:33,402
So, what's the news on Carina?

576
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,604
Anything I can do to help?

577
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,938
Every branch of U.S. intelligence

578
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,239
is looking for her, Chuck.

579
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:38,374
America's best and brightest

580
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:40,710
are on the case, so
you can just sit tight.

581
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,382
Is this the Chuck Bartowski apartment?

582
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,951
Well, it's kind of both
of ours. I got this.

583
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,552
This is VIP only, gentleman.

584
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,754
Martin, where's Chuck and Sarah?

585
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:54,756
Um, on the way, I guess.

586
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,691
I see you brought some
of your... relatives?

587
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,260
Call Chuck. Tell him I'm here.

588
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:00,095
Okay. Whoa, comrade. Ow!

589
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:02,431
Did I not save the odd hippie?

590
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:04,432
Ha, ha! I'm gonna allow that one.

591
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,702
Boys, easy, easy. You
don't want to get physical.

592
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:10,973
Hey, buddy.

593
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Hey, where are you?

594
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,041
Uh, I'm kind of in the middle

595
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:14,042
of something right now.

596
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,144
Yeah, just hold on a second.

597
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,712
I need your advice about Carina.

598
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,448
What about Carina?

599
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:19,716
She's here.

600
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:21,050
I took Big Mike's advice

601
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:22,551
from the El Segundo School of Finance

602
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,320
and asked her to come to the party.

603
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,589
She said yes.

604
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:28,958
So you're telling me that Carina
is at our apartment right now?

605
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:31,161
Yes, but that's not the problem.

606
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:33,397
She shows up with her
boyfriend and three Aqua Velvas.

607
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:35,132
throwing everybody around.
You know, I can't...

608
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,268
Can you believe it?

609
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:39,270
Yeah. Yeah, I can believe it.

610
00:29:39,338 --> 00:29:41,473
She humiliated me in
front of my friends,

611
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,642
and I think I gotta go tell her off.

612
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,444
No, no, no! No, Morgan. Stay away!

613
00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:47,678
Why?

614
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,513
Because it's dangerous...

615
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,448
... really uncool.

616
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:53,784
Women love mystery, buddy.
You gotta, you gotta be aloof.

617
00:29:53,852 --> 00:29:55,652
Promise me that you will stay away.

618
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,790
Yeah, all right, whatever.
I'll try it your way. Thanks.

619
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:06,830
Those studs inside are
gonna ruin our chances

620
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:09,165
with the medium-hot chicks
from Underpants Unlimited.

621
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,701
We don't stand a chance, Jeffrey.

622
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:15,771
Been drinking this jail
juice since I was in diapers.

623
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,174
Built up a tolerance.

624
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,175
I'll challenge them
to a drinking contest,

625
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:23,846
they'll pass out.

626
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:28,650
By process of elimination,
we land the ladies.

627
00:30:28,718 --> 00:30:30,185
I love it!

628
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:35,057
Bottoms up, fellas! Grab your own.

629
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,058
Help yourselves.

630
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,893
Oh, hey, Skip.

631
00:30:38,928 --> 00:30:39,528
Thank you.

632
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,197
Hey, watch that guy!

633
00:30:42,265 --> 00:30:46,401
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, easy,
easy, gentlemen, gentle-men.

634
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,636
It's okay, easy!

635
00:30:47,704 --> 00:30:49,571
He's just hammered.

636
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,672
Get him out!

637
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,074
Easy, gentle giants.

638
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,843
I plan on joining him at
the bottom of this glass.

639
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,177
Gentlemen, lift up your skirts

640
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,645
and start your engines.

641
00:30:57,713 --> 00:30:59,547
Well put, Jeffrey.

642
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:08,122
You know what?

643
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:14,563
Jefferson, no need to waste these.

644
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,497
To you, my friend.

645
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:23,403
Mom used to...

646
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:29,842
Guy's got no tolerance.

647
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:44,690
It's nice to see you think so
much of the ring I bought you.

648
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:47,192
You try anything like that again,

649
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,296
and I'll kill you right here, Smooshy.

650
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,176
Whoa!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

651
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:04,511
Hey, stop-stop-stop!
What are you thinking?

652
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:05,912
You can't just go out there blasting.

653
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,914
All of my friends are out here!
Half the mall is out there!

654
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:09,917
Got a better plan, Bartowski?

655
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:11,922
As a matter of fact, I
do. Carina is still alive,

656
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:14,123
which means she hasn't
given Karl the case yet,

657
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:16,426
which means we have something
to negotiate with peacefully.

658
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:18,828
Chuck's right. The question
is, where's the weapon?

659
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,564
Unbelievable. Cuddling
with my girl in my house!

660
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:25,469
All right. That's it.

661
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:29,839
Bearded bogey incoming.

662
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,540
Martin.

663
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:35,042
Did you speak to Chuck?

664
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:41,014
First things first.

665
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:42,315
My name is not Martin.

666
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:43,482
It's Morgan.

667
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,018
Morgan Guillermo Grimes. Memorize it.

668
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:47,620
Okay, number two.

669
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,121
Just because you're a
beautiful woman that I'd give

670
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:51,523
a non-vital organ to make love
to, doesn't give you the right

671
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:52,557
to just show up here with this clown...

672
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,558
Wait a minute... and humiliate me

673
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:54,526
in front of my friends.

674
00:32:55,428 --> 00:32:56,361
Who is this Todger?

675
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:57,595
You got to be kidding me.

676
00:32:57,663 --> 00:32:59,130
Seriously, do me a favor. Take a hike.

677
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:01,132
And take the slabs of beef with you.

678
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,968
You don't have time to deal
with a dead body, sweetheart.

679
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:06,170
Okay.

680
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:07,238
Move out, boys.

681
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:08,339
Yeah, back it up, bitches.

682
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:10,241
What?!

683
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:12,209
Morgan, maybe you should leave. Yeah.

684
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:14,545
Uh, my house, my party.
I think you need to leave.

685
00:33:14,613 --> 00:33:16,514
Yeah, that's right, hottie. Bounce.

686
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:17,882
All right? Fun fact for you.

687
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:20,718
730 words in the Japanese
language for the word "yes."

688
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,086
No word for no.

689
00:33:22,153 --> 00:33:23,653
But if there was a Japanese word for no,

690
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,255
I'd be saying it to you right now.

691
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:26,556
Instead, I'll leave you with this.

692
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:28,091
Sayonara.

693
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:30,426
You want Chuck to have this?

694
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:32,395
No!

695
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:33,596
Give it to him yourself.

696
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,799
I'm done.

697
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:43,606
Let's go. Don't let the door
hit you on the ass on the way...

698
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:48,876
No one's ever said no to me before.

699
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,911
Idiot.

700
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:52,912
Now they have both
Carina and the weapon.

701
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,213
No negotiating now.

702
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:55,381
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

703
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:56,582
There's still got to be something.

704
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,850
There's got to be a contingency plan

705
00:33:57,918 --> 00:34:00,418
in case enemy agents
infiltrate my apartment, right?

706
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:01,686
Like a button that you push that calls

707
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:03,588
the cavalry, so they can swoop
in and clear everyone out?

708
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:05,724
- Where's the button?
-  Me.

709
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,225
I'm the button.

710
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:20,237
Break it up.

711
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,272
Party's over.

712
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,673
Damn kids.

713
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,175
Get out of here!

714
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,244
That's it. Go on. Get out of here!

715
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:28,513
You, too.

716
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,814
Get out!

717
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,524
Here. You're going to need a weapon.

718
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:41,525
No. No guns.

719
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:43,326
I hate guns... you know that.

720
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:46,897
Think of it as a Bo.

721
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:01,510
Sorry to disturb your sleep, sir.

722
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:04,179
No problem.

723
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:08,283
Drop your weapons!

724
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,921
Put it down.

725
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:14,556
I should have known

726
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:16,559
by your paint
- peeling speech

727
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:18,794
that Uncle Johnny was a narc, too.

728
00:35:18,862 --> 00:35:19,996
Drop the gun, lover boy.

729
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:22,231
I'm having the worst day of my life,

730
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:24,867
so I don't give a fat crap.

731
00:35:26,837 --> 00:35:27,837
Sarah, drop your guns.

732
00:35:27,904 --> 00:35:28,938
Casey, drop your guns.

733
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:30,072
Huh?

734
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,540
Trust me.

735
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:44,553
Get their guns.

736
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,839
Let her go, Karl.

737
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:12,273
You shoot me, I shoot her.

738
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:13,675
I don't care.

739
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,810
Bitch has broken my heart.

740
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:17,844
She dies.

741
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:19,546
I get it, man. I get it, okay?

742
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:23,348
You took a chance.

743
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:24,616
You... you loved someone,

744
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,283
maybe for the first time in your life.

745
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,119
All you've ever done before is...

746
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,721
is shut off your feelings.

747
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,456
You... you bury them deep down inside

748
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,624
because, in your profession...
in your line of work...

749
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,060
it's a liability, right? It's...

750
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:40,030
it can... it can
certainly be a liability.

751
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,533
And I know...

752
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,836
I know that you think that
you messed up your life

753
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,904
because you opened up your heart,

754
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,273
but maybe you helped her

755
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,909
open up her heart in the process.

756
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:56,180
Maybe because you loved her...

757
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,951
she's learned how to love, too.

758
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,456
He's right, Karl.

759
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,692
I did fall in love with you.

760
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,361
Maybe at first you
were just an assignment,

761
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,363
but not anymore.

762
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,901
Really?

763
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,209
Yeah, right, stupid.

764
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,212
Spies don't fall in love.

765
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:01,134
Don't touch it, Mr. Bartowski.

766
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:03,736
Uh, I was just thinking
that maybe if I looked at it,

767
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:04,871
I could flash.

768
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:06,339
No, thank you, Chuck.

769
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:08,908
All I need to know is that
it's now back in safe hands.

770
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:10,143
Colonel Casey will stay with it

771
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:12,112
until a team arrives to secure it.

772
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:13,446
That is all.

773
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,256
We can't keep this a secret anymore.

774
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:23,224
It's too dangerous.

775
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:25,026
We need to tell them.

776
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,329
They need to be prepared.

777
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:29,965
Shaw...

778
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:32,335
please.

779
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,085
I'm listening,

780
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,952
if there's something
that you want to say.

781
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,917
I'm sure there's somewhere
else that you'd rather be.

782
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:56,583
No. I'm good here.

783
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:58,383
For now.

784
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:06,024
You're right... I'm not a real spy.

785
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:09,228
I'm... I'm emotional, and
that makes me a liability.

786
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:10,495
Not always.

787
00:39:10,563 --> 00:39:13,298
You might not have flashed,
but you did your job.

788
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:15,766
You got to Karl, and
you talked him down,

789
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,668
and if it weren't for your emotions,

790
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:19,136
he would've killed Carina.

791
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:24,372
It's quite a mess we made.

792
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:27,808
Yeah.

793
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,677
I'm really hoping we
can clean it up, though.

794
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,745
Maybe.

795
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:35,048
But you're on your
own with the courtyard.

796
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:37,116
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

797
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,086
Morgan.

798
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:46,190
Dude, I'm all alone,

799
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:48,559
cleaning up your mess.

800
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:52,963
This better have been worth it, buddy.

801
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:04,172
Wow.

802
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:06,607
Wow.

803
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:09,576
Why did you...?

804
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:10,710
Mmm.

805
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:14,114
No one's ever said no to me before.

806
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:15,549
It's sexy.

807
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:18,985
Was I...?

808
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,820
Or was it...?

809
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,888
Mmm. I've had better.

810
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,723
Yeah, of course.

811
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:25,857
But not many.

812
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,632
So...

813
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,968
Saint-Tropez doesn't
sound appealing to you?

814
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,903
Oh. Incredibly.

815
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,005
But I think I'm going to stay here.

816
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,940
At least for now.

817
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:47,377
I thought you'd say that.

818
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,780
Here. A little going-away present.

819
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,316
You should take a look at it.

820
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,152
Okay.

821
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,288
So, I guess I'll see you around, huh?

822
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,689
Yeah.

823
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:17,772
Look, Sarah, I know...

824
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:20,842
I know that you're probably very hurt.

825
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,076
You're probably hurt

826
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:24,646
that I didn't run away
with you in Prague.

827
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,914
I did that, and I'm... I'm sorry.

828
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:30,986
You have to know that you were
everything that I ever wanted.

829
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,521
But how can I do that? How
could I run away with you?

830
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:34,956
How could I be with you, knowing

831
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,591
what I'd turned my back on, you know?

832
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:39,627
Knowing that what I had in my
head could help a lot of people?

833
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,366
And you're the one
that taught me that...

834
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,268
that being a spy is about
choosing something bigger.

835
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:51,338
It's... it's about putting
aside your own personal feelings

836
00:41:51,406 --> 00:41:53,774
for the greater good,
and that's what I choose.

837
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:57,444
I chose to be a spy for my
friends and my family and you.

838
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:01,882
I chose to be a spy because...

839
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:04,751
Sarah, I love you.

840
