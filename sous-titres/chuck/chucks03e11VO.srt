1
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,832
Wait, don't do it.
Don't do it.

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,166
Don't do it.

3
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,767
Don't you see? This is exactly
what they want.

4
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:24,899
I gave you a chance.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,166
Please.

6
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,067
I had no choice.

7
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,266
Stop it! Stop. Please.

8
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:04,400
Please.

9
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,534
Jeffrey...

10
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,668
there's so much more
that I want to do.

11
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,701
To feel.

12
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,967
Ah-ha!
You're loathsome.

13
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,034
Just about enough
of you two morons.

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,899
You knocked over
a customer.

15
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,600
You...

16
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,668
fat and drunk and stupid.

17
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:26,668
Together you constitute a clear
and present danger to the store.

18
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,066
Who needs to be neutralized.

19
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,367
You know, John, I know
you like to play make-believe,

20
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,401
that you're some kind
of military tough guy,

21
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,367
but the truth is
that you're just

22
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,067
a schmuck that works
in an electronics store.

23
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,733
With us.

24
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,933
Well, I guess you didn't hear
that Big Mike sent Morgan

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,933
down to El Segundo
for a management seminar

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,633
for the next three days,

27
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:48,601
leaving me in charge
as assistant manager.

28
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:49,799
What a special moment for you.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,933
I assume, then, that
you've been made aware

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,768
of the "no touching" policy
here at the store.

31
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,600
Granted, it's mostly
for Jeff,

32
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,567
but it holds company-wide,
friend.

33
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:00,333
Don't you see, Johnny,

34
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:02,166
you can't harm us.

35
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,433
Thanks to the rules

36
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:07,200
of the very corporate system
that you so admire.

37
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,533
Ha!

38
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:10,434
The irony!

39
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:12,667
I love irony.

40
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:14,568
Well...

41
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:18,999
Casey, what did you just do?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,233
What are you
still doing here?

43
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:21,566
I thought you clocked out.
Yeah.

44
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,233
Yeah, I did, but I thought
I'd take a second

45
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,832
to see how you were adjusting
to civilian life.

46
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,333
Apparently,
not that great.

47
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:27,533
Baby steps.

48
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,467
More like baby kicks
to the groin.

49
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,199
We got to get
you reinstated, buddy.

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,668
Without a license to kill,
you are a menace to society.

51
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:34,966
Hey, listen, listen.

52
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,033
I'm going to talk to Beckman.

53
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm going to tell her

54
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,932
if she doesn't give you
your job back, I'm quitting.

55
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:39,932
Don't be ridiculous.

56
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,366
That's not ridiculous.

57
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,199
I'm going to ask Sarah to
do the same thing, buddy.

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,433
That is,
if she ever calls me back.

59
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:45,733
You know she went
to DC with Shaw?

60
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:47,400
Talk about a weekend
in Snoresville.

61
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,334
Listen up, Chuck.
I disobeyed orders.

62
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:51,634
I put my team
and my country in danger.

63
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,199
This is my job now.

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,100
I made my bunk,
and I'll lie in it.

65
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,734
Unlike you, I know
when something's over.

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,533
BIG MIKE
John Casey!

67
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:02,234
My office! Now!

68
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:04,567
Look, you were put in
an impossible position, okay?

69
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:05,700
You had no choice.

70
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:07,634
It's America, Chuck.

71
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,366
Everyone has a choice.

72
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:12,167
Casey!

73
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,167
You have to choose, John.

74
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,167
Do you see yourself
working here

75
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,999
at the Buy More
for the long haul?

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,167
Well... at the moment,
I don't have a better plan.

77
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,401
Then you've got to stop
coming in so damn hot!

78
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:25,866
Can't be laying hands on people.

79
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:27,199
Not even Jeff
and Lester.

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
He's not a man.

81
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:29,832
He's an animal.
Like Jeff,

82
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,166
but undulled by
drink or drug,

83
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,433
and more dangerous
because of it!

84
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:33,667
We demand justice!

85
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,366
At least a humiliating
apology.

86
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:36,366
Or we're gonna sue!

87
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,366
Mmm!

88
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,400
Who are we gonna sue again?

89
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:39,600
Everybody! The store.

90
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,066
Mr. John Q. Crazy.

91
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,932
Possibly Chuck
and Morgan, too.

92
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,501
You see, being the accused
in a number of civil and...

93
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:49,200
criminal proceedings has left us
extremely litigious!

94
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,033
Okay.

95
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,733
No, no, no, good.

96
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:58,734
Good! That's it!
You're hearing

97
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,099
from my attorney!
Who, by the by,

98
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,600
is my cousin!
Who, by the by,

99
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:03,567
likes me very, very much!

100
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,099
What?

101
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,932
This is serious.

102
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,867
Those boys aren't
fooling about this.

103
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,067
Now... I like you,

104
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,799
and I know you're
physically strong,

105
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,633
but what I need
to know is

106
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,567
are you mentally strong?

107
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,933
Strong enough to bend
like the reed,

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,933
and not snap like the Kit Kat?

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,601
To be John Casey,
not John Crazy.

110
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:33,266
Conking people;
walking around conking heads.

111
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,668
You can't be conking heads
in the Buy More.

112
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,932
It's the Buy More.

113
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,833
Mm-hmm...

114
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,033
Hey, Sarah.

115
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,000
Hi.

116
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,000
How was DC?

117
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,034
I'm assuming you guys
had a lot of fun.

118
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,567
Although I-I can't
really picture

119
00:04:58,634 --> 00:04:59,866
what Shaw does for fun.

120
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,800
Uh, I'm sorry
I didn't call you back,

121
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,199
but it was a work trip,

122
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
and we were in a
lot of meetings.

123
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:08,701
Talking about you,
actually.

124
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,099
About your future.

125
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,433
<i>My future? My future?!</i>

126
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:12,667
No, no, no,
it's Casey's future

127
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,133
that we need
to be concerned with, okay?

128
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:15,700
We got to get him
reinstated. I know, Chuck.

129
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,966
And I would like nothing more

130
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,233
than to get him
reinstated, but...

131
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,200
Casey's status is none
of your concern.

132
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,200
There is business
to attend to, however,

133
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,200
which very much
concerns you.

134
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:27,200
You left your bag in the car on
the way back from the airport.

135
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,366
Oh.

136
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,533
So thoughtful.

137
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:31,099
Good morning, team.

138
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,234
Have you told him anything yet?

139
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,966
Told me what?

140
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,433
After much deliberation,

141
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:38,199
it has been decided that
you are ready for a mission

142
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,668
that will test everything
you have learned thus far.

143
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:43,501
A final spy test, if you will.

144
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,066
Oh.

145
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,600
Test? Yeah. No problem.

146
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,099
I'm a whiz with a
number two pencil.

147
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,300
Scantron.

148
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,932
Chuck, if you fail to
complete the mission,

149
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,199
which you'll undertake
by yourself,

150
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,832
then you'll go back
to your old life.

151
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,300
But if you succeed,

152
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,566
you will be promoted.

153
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,000
No more Buy More,
no more handlers.

154
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,501
Just real missions
for a real spy.

155
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,166
You will be based out of Rome.

156
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:06,601
Your cover will be that of
a billionaire industrialist.

157
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:08,568
Serious- seriously?

158
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,199
<i>Molto bene!</i>

159
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,500
I love it! This is fantastic.

160
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,533
We're all going to have

161
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:15,866
to brush up on
our Italiano.

162
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,033
No, Chuck.
Do you know what I mean?

163
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,333
Just you.

164
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:20,701
Agents Walker and Shaw
will be based in DC

165
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:24,501
and continue to head
counter-Ring operations there.

166
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,933
DC?

167
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,601
D... DC.

168
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:31,800
Not... not Rome.

169
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,800
You will get your mission
specifics tomorrow.

170
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:36,267
Your spy test will start then.

171
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,301
Good luck.

172
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:39,733
You can do this, Chuck.

173
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,634
You can pass this test.

174
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,534
It's everything
you've been working toward.

175
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,334
Me...

176
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,334
A real spy.

177
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,099
In Rome, no less.

178
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,067
Congratulations, Chuck.

179
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,966
It looks like you're
going to get everything

180
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,867
that you always wanted.

181
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:07,458
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

182
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,901
Morning, Chuck.

183
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:50,966
Ga- what?

184
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,167
Hah...

185
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:53,432
Hi.

186
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,299
How-how long have
you been here?

187
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,234
Or are you really here?

188
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,767
I... I could be asleep
right now.

189
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,767
I very well could be asleep
right now.

190
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,467
I have some of the
most vivid dreams

191
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,467
sometimes...
Chuck, you're awake.

192
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:09,399
Please sit down.
Your mission has started.

193
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
This is how a real agent

194
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,400
gets missions
in the field.

195
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,400
What, you surprising
them in the kitchen?

196
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,800
That must involve
a lot of travel.

197
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,000
Focus, Chuck.
From here on in,

198
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,666
my role is to observe
and report.

199
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,567
More of like a proctor
than a partner.

200
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,701
What's this thing?

201
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,200
What-what are you doing?
What are you doing?

202
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,966
Are you writing something?
Are you writing about me?

203
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you grading me?

204
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,200
Uh, think of it more like,

205
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,168
recording the experience
for history.

206
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:40,399
Sure.

207
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,467
Good morning, Chuck.

208
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,534
Your mission centers
around this man,

209
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,133
Anatoli Zevlovski.

210
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,699
A Russian FSB agent.

211
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,267
He's in Los Angeles to meet

212
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:51,100
with a person
we believe works for us.

213
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,733
Who-who "us," General?

214
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:53,599
It's a recording, Chuck.

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,833
What's that?

216
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,033
A mole within the CIA,

217
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:57,499
who has been
selling secrets to Anatoli,

218
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,966
who then sells them to the Ring.

219
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,333
This mole is responsible
for the deaths

220
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,201
of hundreds of civilians
and nine of our agents.

221
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,467
We have intel that Anatoli
is meeting with him, or her,

222
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,867
at the Cobalt Hotel
and Spa tonight.

223
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:13,234
Your mission is to ascertain
the identity of the mole.

224
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,900
You will stakeout
the hotel's entrance

225
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,600
and let Anatoli lead you
to the mole.

226
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,066
Wait!
That's all I need to know?

227
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,766
How can that be all
I need to know?

228
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,033
Is there a rewind on this thing?

229
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:23,934
What's the deal? Come on.

230
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:25,866
Wow.

231
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,200
That just really
self-destructed, did it not?

232
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:28,366
That-that's like
in the movies.

233
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,399
That's incredible.

234
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,432
Well, I got it, anyway.

235
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:32,367
Take out Anatoli
and find the mole.

236
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,333
Done and done.

237
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,100
Still with the writing.
What is this?

238
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,666
Like-like the CIA's
permanent record?

239
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,900
It's just like in junior high.

240
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,299
Pretty much.

241
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,234
Really?

242
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,699
So... so you're saying

243
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,566
that's got all the greatest hits
in it, huh?

244
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,001
All the, uh,
daring escapes,

245
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:53,300
and last-second bomb defusions,
and-and I would hope, uh,

246
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,333
all of the world-class
stakeout mixes.

247
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,299
Yeah.

248
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,400
Everything is in here.

249
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,433
We've definitely been
through a lot.

250
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,800
I mean, not-not just us.

251
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,533
Casey, as well.

252
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:09,200
Yeah, Casey, as well.
That guy.

253
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:11,134
Uh, hey, hey, um,

254
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,699
speaking-speaking
of stakeouts...

255
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,067
uh, you're going to be
at the stakeout tonight, right?

256
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,233
Right.

257
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,666
Shaw will quarterback
from the Castle.

258
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,600
But, so, so, this is like, um,

259
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,067
our last mission together.

260
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:25,234
Seems like we should
do something special.

261
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,901
Something special will be you
completing your mission

262
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,466
and becoming a spy, Chuck.

263
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,400
Of course, of course.

264
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,967
I'm just saying...

265
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,366
last mission.

266
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,633
Kind of makes you think.

267
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:38,600
Old times.

268
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,366
Good times.

269
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,834
Dangerous, but-but good.

270
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,467
Yeah. It does.

271
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:48,534
I'll see you tonight.

272
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,500
See you tonight.

273
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,567
Chin up, please.

274
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,933
This is Clarence,
my tailor.

275
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,100
Hi.

276
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:02,566
What is this about?

277
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,667
Well, this is about...
Mmm!

278
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,566
You lookin' good, Mike!

279
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:07,833
You losing weight?

280
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,233
Thank you, Clarence.
I have.

281
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,700
I ask again: Why am I here?

282
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,001
You're here because I want
to help you try

283
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,234
to smooth out some
of those jagged edges.

284
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,167
With a little help
from Clarence here.

285
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,866
Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,633
Jagged's good. I like jagged.

287
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:23,834
You also like to be an
employed person, too, don't you?

288
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,867
Maybe one without a lawsuit
slapped on him.

289
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,400
Now, I've talked
to Jeff and Lester,

290
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,234
told them that I could
get you to change.

291
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,168
And that change
starts right now.

292
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:37,834
Get on the box.

293
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:39,766
You don't seriously think
that new clothes

294
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,934
are going to somehow
make me less me, do you?

295
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:45,600
Look, what I do know is that
to get your head right,

296
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,366
you got to get
your threads right.

297
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,966
Now, get on the box

298
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,867
and let Clarence
put some new feathers on you.

299
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,801
Hey, Chuck.

300
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,767
Everything looks good.
It doesn't seem

301
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,332
like you've
missed a trick.

302
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,268
Uh, yeah, thanks.

303
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,268
There is one more thing, though.

304
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,734
* Ta-da! *

305
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,101
No one throws a stakeout
like Chuck Bartowski.

306
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:03,767
You can put that
in my secret file.

307
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,734
A little bubbly
for you.

308
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:10,101
And a little bubbly...
for me.

309
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,733
Uh, so tell me-

310
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,667
do the words,
"sizzling shrimp" ring a bell?

311
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,667
From our very
first stakeout.

312
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,634
That's right.
How could I forget?

313
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,734
* *

314
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,934
Also from our first stakeout.

315
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:33,901
And yet, timeless.

316
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,599
You're going to miss me in DC.

317
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,500
You know that, right?

318
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,500
I know.

319
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,168
So, um...

320
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,168
So, you and Shaw,
you're going to be...

321
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,033
living together?
Is that it?

322
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,801
Like, are you, uh...
you guys real serious or what?

323
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,333
Uh, I don't know.

324
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,667
It's... it's different.

325
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,499
Different how?

326
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,534
Than with you.

327
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:10,634
You know, I'm...
I'm, uh... I'm...

328
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:16,267
It's Shaw.

329
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:17,866
Hold on.

330
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,432
Yeah. Hello.

331
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,600
Is there a problem?
Uh, no, no, there's no...

332
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,499
there's no problem here.
Why would there be a problem?

333
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,666
Can I talk to you
after the mission?

334
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,801
You should have
your earpiece in already.

335
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,267
Is Sarah there?

336
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,866
Yeah, Sarah's right here.
She just got here.

337
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,767
What a coincidence.
Hey, Sarah. How are you?

338
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,533
Thanks for the reminder
about the earpieces.

339
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,434
Anatoli and the mole
could arrive any minute, Chuck.

340
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,599
Stay on the ball.

341
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,933
It's all you out there.

342
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:40,333
Okay. Talk to you soon. Bye.

343
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:54,834
What I... what I was going
to ask you, uh, a minute ago,

344
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:58,268
or what I was about
to say, anyway...

345
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,534
was that I've been, um...
I've been thinking

346
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,767
about what it used
to be like between us.

347
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,200
Before Prague.

348
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:09,700
And, uh, thinking about
what life would be like for us

349
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,901
if we'd made
different decisions back then.

350
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,934
If I had made
a different decision back then.

351
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,499
Look, I know we couldn't
be together before

352
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,101
because I wasn't a real spy,
but if I pass this test,

353
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:30,901
we wouldn't have to choose
between the job and us.

354
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,600
If I pass this test,
we could be together.

355
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,432
That is, of course,

356
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:39,600
if you're willing
to give it another shot.

357
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,100
Did you see him?
Did you flash?

358
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,332
No, I... no, I didn't.

359
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,666
Should I have?

360
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,734
Anatoli's in the hotel.
He just swiped a credit card

361
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:59,499
he uses at the spa.
How did you miss him?

362
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,533
I don't know.
I- I just did.

363
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:02,133
I'm going after him.

364
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:04,134
What?
Sarah, give him the glasses.

365
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:05,966
Wait. Here.

366
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,332
Put these on.
They'll record everything

367
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,633
and relay it
back to Castle.

368
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,634
Okay. Sarah, get back to Castle.

369
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,833
You're on your own, Chuck.

370
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,366
Now, get in there
before the mission

371
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,267
and your spy career are over.

372
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,168
This isn't over.

373
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:40,934
Sir!

374
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,699
Can I help you?

375
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,601
Do you have an appointment
for a treatment?

376
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:46,568
Uh, no, no, not an
appointment per se.

377
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,634
I, uh, made plans with
a friend of mine-

378
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,266
a Russian fellow-
to meet here.

379
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,066
We really enjoy
spa-ing...

380
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,234
together, so...

381
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:56,501
Yes, I.. I think he
and his party just checked in.

382
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:58,534
The day use fee is $100,

383
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,732
not including
treatments.

384
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,633
$100.

385
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,934
Let me just...

386
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,633
I can expense this, right?

387
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,201
Pay it, Chuck.
Right.

388
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:11,733
Just gonna break out
the old plastic.

389
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Good.

390
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:22,367
I just checked the men's
locker room; nobody's here.

391
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,334
Check the steam room.

392
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,466
What? Uh, uh, excuse me.

393
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,033
Inside the steam room?

394
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:30,067
Is that really hygienic?

395
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,034
You can tell me
when you come out.

396
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,100
Wow, it's really steamy in here.

397
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,601
Just sit tight. Steam will
clear up in a minute or so.

398
00:17:58,334 --> 00:17:59,533
What the hell happened
back there?

399
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:00,600
It wasn't his fault.

400
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,732
You've been in the field.

401
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,633
Operations don't
always go as planned.

402
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,967
Oh, wow. Hi there.

403
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,832
Looks like I'm not
alone after all.

404
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,866
No, just...

405
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:14,467
three other
people in here...

406
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,467
with me.

407
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:17,533
How fun.

408
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:18,966
It's just Anatoli
and his muscle.

409
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,267
He must not have
made contact yet with the mole.

410
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,234
Stay with him.

411
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,600
Mr. Drago?

412
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,466
Mr. Ivan Drago?
Yes.

413
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,367
Ivan Drago. Seriously?

414
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,366
He's paranoid.

415
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,633
Believes we're
being followed.

416
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:39,066
Wants to meet upstairs
in the room.

417
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,967
Let's go.

418
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,967
Hey. Why so quick

419
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:54,934
<i>to pick up trash on banya floor?</i>

420
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,534
Chuck, get out of there.

421
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:04,468
Just doing my part.
Keeping it green.

422
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,234
Chuck, you have to get
to the mole before he leaves.

423
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,766
Get moving!

424
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,767
Lockers
to your left, sir.

425
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,733
Yeah.

426
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,401
Anatoli's on the seventh floor.

427
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,466
He's here meeting the mole.

428
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,832
Nice work, Chuck.
Your priority

429
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,934
is I.D.'ing the mole,
but do not blow your cover.

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,133
He can't know
we're onto him.

431
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,267
Got it.

432
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,468
Ah! Good shower time.

433
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,233
Oh, I think I got my
watch a little wet,

434
00:20:18,234 --> 00:20:20,134
so I'm just going to dry it off
on the balcony.

435
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:23,100
Sorry, I forgot to put
the "privacy please" sign up.

436
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,800
Come on, Chuck. You can do this.

437
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,201
This would have been easier
in underpants.

438
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:48,866
Well done.

439
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,934
You are about to become
an even richer man.

440
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,501
We should begin
the process of retrieval.

441
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:55,601
Change of plans, Anatoli.

442
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,934
I'm dealing directly
with the Ring now.

443
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,900
Your services
are no longer needed.

444
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,667
Oh, God... Oh, my God...

445
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:18,366
The mole just killed Anatoli.

446
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:19,567
Forget Anatoli.
The mole is leaving.

447
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,468
You gotta get a look
at his face.

448
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,100
We've got it, Chuck.

449
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,601
Congratulations.

450
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
I am a spy.

451
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,167
Looking good, John.

452
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,667
Feeling pretty good.

453
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:27,433
Yeah, that Clarence
can work wonders.

454
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:28,932
We here for a light lunch?

455
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,266
Yes and no.

456
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,501
I got Jeff and Lester
to agree to a deal.

457
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:37,200
If you could sit down
with them and apologize,

458
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:39,701
if you can show them that "John
Crazy" has been put on ice,

459
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:41,400
they'll drop this
lawsuit thing.

460
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,700
So the question is:

461
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,900
you look cool;
can you be cool?

462
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:55,900
Lester, Jeff...

463
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,234
I would like to apologize...

464
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,833
...for roughing you guys up
earlier; it's just, I...

465
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,266
I'm sorry, Jonathan,

466
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,167
but sweet, sweet,
sweet Lisa here

467
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,266
would like
some payment

468
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:08,799
for these
sandwiches.

469
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,867
But I didn't order 'em. No.

470
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:13,067
I did.

471
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,867
Oh, my God,
is that tuna and pepperoni?

472
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,133
Yes, it is.

473
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,133
The tuna-roni.

474
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:24,166
You see,

475
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,333
Johnny Boy,

476
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:26,999
I need to know
that you understand

477
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,333
that apologies

478
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:29,899
are about more
than just words.

479
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,067
Often, they're about money,
and in this case, yours.

480
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:36,900
Mm-hmm.

481
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:42,999
Keep the change, sister.

482
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,366
Lester, you're pushing it.

483
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,434
The man apologized.
Now let it go.

484
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,333
What assurances
do Jeffrey and I have

485
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,434
that such civilized behavior
is gonna continue

486
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,932
when we and this

487
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:54,000
monster are
alone together?

488
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,667
Oh, God.

489
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:57,832
It was good.

490
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,768
Yummy.

491
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,534
Lester, I promise I won't
bang you guys around anymore.

492
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,501
Okay, Lester-
so everything's cool.

493
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:06,567
No more lawsuit.

494
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:07,633
Yeah, we're cool.

495
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:08,899
If...

496
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,300
we seal
our newfound understanding

497
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:12,166
in that time-tested way-

498
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,534
by breaking
freshly-baked bread together.

499
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,366
Right? I think that's...

500
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,267
Jefferson?

501
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,467
Mind you,
there's literally no way

502
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:23,900
of knowing where this guy's
mouth has been before this.

503
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:25,867
Fire hydrants, diseased animals,

504
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,800
puppets.

505
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,634
Very civilized.

506
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:35,300
Oh, no.

507
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,201
Oh, John.

508
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,266
Hey, there, colleague.

509
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,167
Peer.

510
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,099
Uh, hey, so tell me.

511
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,266
When should I expect

512
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:53,401
to receive my international
spy union card, hmm?

513
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,367
You did a great job
last night, Chuck.

514
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:56,667
Congratulations.

515
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:58,466
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

516
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:01,200
Uh, so, tell me-
uh, and this is just, you know,

517
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,533
between the two of us,

518
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,467
just for the sake
of conversation, but, uh-

519
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,033
as far as these tests go,

520
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:08,534
do other people usually do
as well as I did?

521
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:10,400
Or did I do, like,
historically well?

522
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:12,301
Uh, listen, Chuck,

523
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:15,134
I was hoping that you would
be free for dinner tonight.

524
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,100
Yeah?

525
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, uh, yeah, of course.

526
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:22,367
In fact, I was actually going
to ask you if-if you were free.

527
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:24,233
So, how about

528
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:25,500
Traxx?

529
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:27,333
It's a restaurant
down at Union Station.

530
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:30,067
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that sounds great.

531
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:33,933
Nothing whets the whistle like
the sound of a nice long horn.

532
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,466
Forget it.
I'm-I'm very excited.

533
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:39,099
Well, don't be too excited.

534
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,400
Let me finish.

535
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:43,634
By "excited," I-I mean,
uh, cold as ice,

536
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:46,900
because, you know,
now I am a real spy.

537
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:56,501
<i>You made me proud.</i>

538
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,400
<i>Oh, I got to say,
you were right.</i>

539
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:00,933
Feels good not to be
so wound up all the time.

540
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,166
What'd I tell you?

541
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,067
Subway can soothe the
tummy and the soul.

542
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,867
Oh, did somebody say something
about soothed tummies and souls?

543
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,900
I did, and I'm
happy to say

544
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,668
we've got ourself
a changed man, Chuck.

545
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:17,301
<i>Well, uh, I guess
that makes two changed men.</i>

546
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,267
What? You?
Yeah.

547
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,467
Buddy, I-I just passed my first
solo spy test last night.

548
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:25,199
This is it.
I'm going to the show.

549
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,667
I- I really wanted
to tell you beforehand.

550
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,932
I'm sorry that I didn't.

551
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,400
But you know, top secret.
You understand?

552
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,900
You took your test last
night, and you passed?

553
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,167
Oh, yeah...
with flying colors, man.

554
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:35,932
And I think we both know

555
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,967
that I have you
to thank for that,

556
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:40,933
so I-I... wanted to give you
a little something.

557
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,134
Yeah.

558
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,734
I don't think they're gonna
miss it down in Castle, do you?

559
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,700
What?

560
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:52,301
You know that giving away
a government-issued firearm

561
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:55,000
is a felony, don't you?

562
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:57,434
But it was a thoughtful felony.

563
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,534
Honestly, everything
is coming up roses right now.

564
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,266
I mean, I passed my test.

565
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:04,334
Uh, you are joining the world of
human beings, so proud of you.

566
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:05,400
Kudos for that.

567
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,500
And Sarah

568
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,133
has invited me
to dinner tonight.

569
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:09,566
Alone.

570
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,601
At Union Station, so...

571
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:14,933
Really? You sure
you've completed your test?

572
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,933
Yeah. Yeah, like I said,
I passed.

573
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,832
Celebration time now.

574
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,034
Hmm. Okay.

575
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,667
You just be careful out there.

576
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:24,233
Ready for anything.

577
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:26,634
Yeah. A good spy
always is, right?

578
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:33,067
You told him
to meet you tonight?

579
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,500
I did.

580
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,932
So, what's the rest
of his mission?

581
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:37,300
With Anatoli dead,

582
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:39,967
there's only one piece left
to be cleaned up: Perry.

583
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,668
We've arranged for him
to meet Chuck at the restaurant.

584
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,267
And Chuck has
to bring him in?

585
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,533
No.

586
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,166
Chuck has to kill him.

587
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,301
What?

588
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,267
Chuck has to kill him?

589
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:54,099
You're giving him
his Red Test tonight?

590
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,932
That's right.

591
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,366
Why didn't you tell me?

592
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,534
Because you would've said
you couldn't be a part of it.

593
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:01,534
I can't.

594
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:04,167
I can't be a part of it,
and I won't.

595
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,866
You have to meet him.

596
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,900
I can't make him
do something like that.

597
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm not even sure
that I want him

598
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,967
to be able
to do something like that.

599
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,334
I'm sorry, Sarah, but
this isn't about what you want.

600
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,633
It's about Chuck,

601
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:18,233
and our finding out
what he's capable of.

602
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:20,167
Perry is a seasoned agent,

603
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,401
and he is gonna do anything
to save himself.

604
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,634
And if Chuck freezes, then...

605
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:27,100
then... we could lose him.

606
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:28,566
And that's why you'll be there.

607
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:29,967
If you give him the order,

608
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,868
if you tell him to kill perry,
he'll do it.

609
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,900
Hi.

610
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,601
Wow.

611
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:12,333
You look great.

612
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,567
Better than great.

613
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,233
Thank you.

614
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:16,766
You look great, too.

615
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,066
Thank you very much.

616
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:19,967
Feel pretty good.

617
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:23,900
Right off the bat, I-I
just... I want to apologize.

618
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:25,366
I want to say I'm sorry

619
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,601
if I came across a little
too strong last night.

620
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:29,833
It's just that, with the way
things seemed to be progressing

621
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,634
between you and Shaw, I wanted
to tell you how I felt, and I...

622
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,200
Chuck...

623
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,167
I'm doing it again, aren't I?
I'm coming across...

624
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm-I'm... I'm coming
across too strong.

625
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:38,766
I'm sorry about that.

626
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,934
Appetizer? Uh...

627
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,166
Let's have an appetizer.

628
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:43,333
No! What am I thinking?

629
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:44,966
I got to thank you.
Thank you.

630
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,600
I wouldn't even be here right
now if it wasn't for you.

631
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,766
Please don't say that.

632
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,466
But it's true.

633
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:52,267
Chuck, you're going to want
to stay calm right now, okay?

634
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,634
I need you to trust me.

635
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:58,601
Why? Are you planning on
surprising me with something?

636
00:29:58,668 --> 00:29:59,999
Is that what this is?

637
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,967
Uh, something like that, yeah.

638
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:07,867
Your mission
isn't over, Chuck.

639
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:17,800
The man in the photo is the man
that you I.D.'d last night.

640
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:20,301
He's a traitor who continues
to put civilians

641
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,267
and agents
and the nation at risk.

642
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,634
We have arranged
for you to meet him here

643
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,533
at the restaurant
in five minutes time.

644
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,200
He knows you are CIA.

645
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,832
And he will remain cautious,

646
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,034
and probably try
to maintain his cover.

647
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,201
The final part
of your mission is to kill him.

648
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:59,034
Are you being serious right now?
Are you kidding me?

649
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,634
Kill him here, now?
I can't do that.

650
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,600
Then you won't become a spy.

651
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:06,501
But then...

652
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,934
...we couldn't...

653
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,367
No. Probably not.

654
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:16,967
Sarah, when all this started,

655
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:20,401
I didn't think I had a chance
at ever becoming a real spy.

656
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,534
But if I...
if I can't do this,

657
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,200
then-then... then what'll I be?

658
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:27,600
Then you'll be Chuck,

659
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:29,501
and there is nothing wrong
with that.

660
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:33,401
That's all I can say.

661
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:35,367
I'm sorry.
The rest is your decision.

662
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,501
Sarah, wait.

663
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:42,800
Are-Are we absolutely sure
about this guy?

664
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,800
Yes. Your target is Perry.

665
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:47,201
Your orders are clear.

666
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:51,501
I don't know if I can do this.

667
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:53,300
The decision is yours, Chuck,

668
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:55,934
but please know
that there is no turning back.

669
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:02,067
* *

670
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:27,067
Has Carmichael checked in?

671
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:38,033
Carmichael?

672
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:40,467
Uh, uh, yeah.

673
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:42,668
Yeah, that's me.

674
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:46,800
Hope this doesn't take
too long.

675
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,366
Got a date later.

676
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,334
Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't-
that shouldn't be a problem.

677
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,301
This should be... fast.

678
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:58,401
These are, uh, some photos of
some folks that I work with.

679
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:03,100
Just wanted to see if maybe
you recognize any of them.

680
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,899
Uh, yeah, maybe I will.

681
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,301
Sort of pride myself
on never forgetting faces.

682
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:09,700
I should hit the restroom
first, though.

683
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:10,832
Is that okay?

684
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, yeah, sure, not a problem.

685
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,167
* *

686
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,833
Get up.

687
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,033
Get up!
Relax, relax!

688
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:44,266
Relax, relax.

689
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:46,601
Look, I had no choice;
I had no choice.

690
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,366
These people- the Ring-
you have no idea.

691
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:50,133
Oh, I have an idea. Then
you know these people

692
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:51,966
weren't going
to put me in jail.

693
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,867
They were going to kill me.

694
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:58,401
You're not here
to arrest me either.

695
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,201
I should have known.

696
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,167
You might as well be
one of them.

697
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:11,100
I am not one of them; I will
never be one of them;

698
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:14,301
<i>and for that very reason,
I am going to arrest you.</i>

699
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,899
In fact, at
this very moment,

700
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,934
consider yourself
officially arrested, okay?

701
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,667
Okay? Now, you and I,

702
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:24,034
you and I- we're going to take
a nice, friendly, calm,

703
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,700
leisurely walk out
of this men's room.

704
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:27,933
Turn around.

705
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:30,568
Turn around!
Turn around!

706
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,334
Sarah, what's happening?

707
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,667
Mind easing up
on that piece?

708
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:50,100
My back's all screwed up.

709
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,568
Thanks, buddy.

710
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,166
Slow it down, okay?

711
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,300
Hey, slow down.

712
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:57,201
Whoa.
Whoa, I'm sor...

713
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:29,534
* *

714
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:01,334
Wait, don't do it,
don't do it, don't do it.

715
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:03,066
Don't you see? This is
exactly what they want.

716
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,567
I gave you a chance.

717
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,867
Please... I had no choice.

718
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:44,067
Well?

719
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:56,568
What does
all this mean, Casey?

720
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:58,934
I mean, technically,
I failed my test.

721
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,634
You need to understand that
to Walker, Shaw, and Beckman,

722
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,533
you passed the test.

723
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,434
To them, you
killed Perry,

724
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:06,766
doing exactly what you
were trained to do.

725
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,200
Yeah, except that I didn't
do it, you did.

726
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:10,134
Chuck, I'm a civilian,

727
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:12,568
which means technically,
under the law,

728
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:13,899
what happened
tonight was murder.

729
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,234
No one can know the
truth about that

730
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:19,134
ever...
not even Sarah.

731
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:20,433
She'd be
implicated, too.

732
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:22,634
But all that means
that I'm still not a real spy.

733
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,900
I don't know who I am;
I don't know what I am.

734
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,867
Can't answer that
one for you, Chuck.

735
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,767
Hey...

736
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:35,034
Why did you do it?

737
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,900
Because you weren't going to.

738
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:39,867
You're not a killer, Chuck.

739
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:42,501
Thanks.

740
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:48,234
Come on, Sarah.

741
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:50,334
Where are you?

742
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,167
Sarah?

743
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:19,033
Good evening, Chuck.

744
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:22,301
Congratulations.
You are now officially an agent.

745
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:25,534
Included is a plane ticket
to Washington for your immediate

746
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,733
final induction and processing.

747
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,501
Sarah and Shaw will stay behind
to wrap out Burbank operations.

748
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:48,401
Come on, Sarah.

749
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:54,600
Sarah, hey, uh...

750
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,501
it's, it's me.

751
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,668
<i>I- I need to talk to you.</i>

752
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,333
About everything.

753
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,967
Are you okay?

754
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:09,733
I... I just didn't think
that he would do it.

755
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,733
They want me to fly
to DC tonight.

756
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,100
And now I realize that
it's my fault that he did.

757
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,467
Please just call me back
as soon as you get this message.

758
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:21,467
Chuck made his
own choice,

759
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:23,400
and, like the rest
of us, he did it

760
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:25,401
to serve his country.

761
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,500
At dinner, he said
he wouldn't even be here

762
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,634
if it wasn't for me,
and he was right.

763
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,567
Are you still in love with him?

764
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:35,334
No.

765
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:37,401
Not anymore.

766
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:44,201
It's just, he's not going
to be the same person again.

767
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:45,400
I know I wasn't.

768
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,767
I remember everything
about my Red Test.

769
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:52,334
<i>A street name
and a time to be there.</i>

770
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:56,967
<i>No name, just a photo.</i>

771
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:03,000
<i>And it was all happening
the way it was supposed to.</i>

772
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:07,733
<i>And then she dropped something,
like a piece of jewelry, and...</i>

773
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,966
<i>...and I just couldn't do it,</i>

774
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:13,600
not with her
on the ground like that,

775
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,401
so I just
kept walking.

776
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,333
<i>And then, in a reflection,</i>

777
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:21,501
<i>I saw her reaching
for a weapon.</i>

778
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:26,201
<i>Well, at least I thought
I saw her reaching.</i>

779
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:32,733
<i>And I wanted to go back
and check to make sure,</i>

780
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,067
<i>but it was, uh,
there was no time.</i>

781
00:41:36,134 --> 00:41:39,067
It's never easy.

782
00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:41,534
But, in the end,
it helps to save lives.

783
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,833
Never forget that.

784
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,700
It was the worst day of my life.

785
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,733
Oh, thank God- Sarah.

786
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,066
Hey.

787
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,799
Good evening, Agent Bartowski.

788
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,200
Your flight to Washington
leaves in an hour.

789
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:08,066
I'm here to take you to
the airport.

790
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,967
Are you ready?
