1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,600
TOP SECRET LOCATION, 1994

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,600
I yield, sensei.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,200
You are unfocused, again.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,300
- I yield.
- Too slow.

5
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,200
Again!

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,500
Your center is filled
with conflict, John.

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,400
Until you find your calm center,
you will never beat me.

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,300
You can't beat
a winning smile, John.

9
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:55,800
Not in retail sales.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,900
You need to show your customers
those pearly whites.

11
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,200
Well, soon-to-be pearly whites.
You need to bleach them.

12
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,100
Just show them you
got a pulse, Casey.

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,800
Give 'em a "Hey, how ya doin?"

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,000
Or a "Put 'em there, partner. "

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,200
Or "You bet!"

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,000
Walk on back to the back...

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,300
You bet.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
Thanks for the
tips, Emmett.

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,800
Yup. John Casey
scares me.

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,765
Well, that's what happens

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,665
when you bottle up
your feelings like that.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,200
You wake up one day and
you're a seething mass of pain.

23
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:34,700
Right. Hey, what's going
on with you and Jill?

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,600
Ah, yeah.
My, my pain.

25
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:38,300
Let's talk about that.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,300
- Where is she?
- Big house.

27
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,165
Bought a big house.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,300
Bought a real big house
up the river.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,800
Oh, that sounds
really pretty.

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,565
You guys are, uh,
"done" done, right?

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,765
Yeah, I mean, I just figured
out hanging out with Jill

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,900
- was more about closing a door than opening one.
- I get it. I get it.

33
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,300
Listen, the old flame can burn,
right? But I bet you, it made

34
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:59,400
you even more sure who
the right girl is for you.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,100
Ah, speak of the smoking
hot angel.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,300
- I'll get out of here.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,365
Hey, Sarah.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,300
Chuck, does
the Global Launch Agency

39
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:11,600
mean anything to you?

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,250
GLA? Sure, they've
sent probes

41
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:14,700
to every planet
except Pluto.

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,400
Although, Pluto's not officially
a planet anymore,

43
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,100
which really bums me out.

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
That's true.

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,850
Space camp is where

46
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:22,900
all the cool kids go.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,265
GLA also conducts

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,265
top secret research
for the NSA.

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,000
Most of our surveillance
and weapons tracking technology is developed there.

50
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,100
We picked up intel that
someone might try to penetrate

51
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,000
one of the lab's
secure facilities.

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,800
I want you and the Intersect
to surveil the facility.

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,000
See if there's anyone inside
who you flash on.

54
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:40,100
Another mission already?

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Is there a problem,
Mr. Bartowski?

56
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:43,300
No, no.

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,565
No, I was just, you know,

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
I was kind of hoping
for some downtime.

59
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:47,900
We'll take it from here, ma'am.

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,100
Aw, you need a little break,
Bartowski?

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,100
Yeah, that'd be nice.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,765
I mean, finding out
Jill was Fulcrum

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
was a bit of a shock
to the system, you know?

64
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,700
I guess I wouldn't mind

65
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,500
some time
to sort out my feelings.

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,665
Sure thing, Chuck.

67
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,700
I'll just call all the criminals and rogue spies

68
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:07,865
and let
them know to hold on a sec,

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,100
'cause Chuck Bartowski
needs some time to sort out his lady feelings.

70
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,400
Ease up, Casey.

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,965
Look, Chuck, we know how hard
this has been for you,

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,500
but maybe a new mission is
exactly what you need right now.

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,700
Great, new mission
in the surveillance van.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Very exciting.

75
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,665
You're on an open mic, Chuck.

76
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,800
Am I? That's, that's
good to know.

77
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,765
Thanks for telling me that.

78
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,300
Uh, I have all the entrances
and exits covered.

79
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,000
It looks pretty quiet.

80
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,950
You're not seeing anything?

81
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,800
Nothing. No flashes, nothing.

82
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm all clear here.

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,100
All clear.

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,500
Security's tight.

85
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,600
Close the west lab door, Chuck!

86
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
I'm in! I'm in! I'm in, it's
just going to take a second.

87
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:12,300
Do it! Do it!

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,800
Almost got it. Almost got it.
Almost there.

89
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,000
Now, Chuck. Close it.

90
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,100
Lock it down!

91
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,665
You know, I don't know

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,665
one person
who responds positively

93
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,300
- to being yelled at!
- He's getting away, Chuck.

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,900
Door closed.
Got it. There. See?

95
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,465
You idiot!

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,200
You said you knew
how to work this system.

97
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,800
Ooh, hang in there.

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,465
Come on, Chuck!

99
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,900
Almost got it.
Almost got it.

100
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Got it.

101
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,600
No problem.

102
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,100
Ye of little faith.

103
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,300
Sensei?

104
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,400
GO!

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
NSA TACTICAL INSTRUCTOR
TY BENNETT

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,100
Oh, no.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,100
Hey, did you get
a good look at him?

108
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,000
Didn't have to.
I know him.

109
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:39,865
What?

110
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,600
Guys! Hey! I just
flashed on that dude.

111
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:42,765
And it is crazy,
it's actually

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
kind of a small world,
funny story.

113
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,600
Save it.

114
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,100
His name's Ty Bennett.

115
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
He was my sensei.

116
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,400
Taught me everything I know.

117
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,300
You okay?

118
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,000
Hmm.
BUY MORE

119
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,765
Feeling better now.

Chuck! Chuck! You've got to
help me! This is an emergency!

124
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,965
- Chuck!
- What? What? What?

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,365
- Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Are you okay!?
- No! No!

126
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Devon's parents decided to take the red-eye in
from Connecticut to surprise us!

127
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,367
You scared the heck out of me.

128
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,865
I thought this
was life or death.

129
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,800
It is! These are
two perfect parents that raised

130
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:55,665
three perfect boys
in a perfect house,

131
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,565
- and this place is a pigsty.
- Don't worry.

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,800
We have time to clean up.
If they flew all night,

133
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,365
they're going to want
to sleep all morning.

134
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,000
Are you kidding me? The
awesome apple doesn't fall

135
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,400
far from the awesome tree.

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm just going to...
I'll be right there.

137
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,865
Awesome!
There's the man!

138
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,100
Wow! Welcome! Hi.
You guys are very muscular.

139
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,665
And... and awake!

140
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Chuck, this is
Devon's mom and dad.

141
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,965
Drs. Woodcomb,

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,065
so nice to finally meet you.

143
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Oh, no handshakes
in this family.

144
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,000
- You just call me Honey.
- Okay, Honey.

145
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,800
- I'm Woody.
- Hey, Woody.

146
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,565
Yeah. My father
always said,

147
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,700
"A terrible nickname
builds character. "

148
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,000
Of course, Devon wasn't into nicknames.

149
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
I just can't
wait to start planning your dream wedding.

150
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,900
Wow! It looks
like you already have.

151
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,200
Oh, and, Chuck,

152
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,365
the caterer is
bringing over

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,400
a sample menu tonight for Devon and Ellie
to decide what they like. We hope you

154
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,500
and your... girlfriend
can join us.

155
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:54,865
Yes! Of course!
Of course!

156
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
- Sarah loves food.
- That she does!

157
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:57,900
So, yeah,
we'll be there!

158
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,865
Good. Good.

159
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,665
So nice of you guys

160
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
to help us plan
the wedding. Right, Ell?

161
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:02,665
Oh, absolutely!

162
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,800
Your mom's already been busy with
all these lists of guests, locations,

163
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,065
color palettes...

164
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,565
She's been
so excited

165
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,500
ever since Devon
asked you to marry him.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,300
I can't tell you
how happy we are

167
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,600
to welcome you
into our family.

168
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,900
And now, you're stuck
with us, too, Chuck.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,900
You're very strong,
and have fists.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,100
Thank you, Dr. Woodcomb.

171
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,167
"Woody. "

172
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,165
Okay.

173
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,265
Dad, let's go do our abs.

174
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,200
- Ooh, yeah.
- You guys do abs.

175
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm... I'm just going to go...
kill myself.

176
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,500
Ty Bennett: karate master,

177
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,400
kung fu expert,
master strategist.

178
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,600
A former instructor at our
training facility. And, today,

179
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,600
one of our most wanted
rogue agents.

180
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:42,965
Dude, your sensei is a badass!

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,900
He's not my sensei.
He's a traitor.

182
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,465
Wow. I've heard of Bennett,

183
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,200
but I've never met anyone
who actually trained with him.

184
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:50,665
I can't talk about it.
It's classified.

185
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,665
We're opening Bennett's file
for this assignment.

186
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,600
Any personal knowledge you have
could be vital to the success of this mission.

187
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,200
Come on, Casey.
Share with us.

188
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,500
In hell.

189
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,000
General, if I may, why wasn't
I told that Bennett went rogue?

190
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,600
Ty Bennett has been recruiting
his former students.

191
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:08,917
He's actually turning agents?

192
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:10,165
With the team he's assembled,

193
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,300
Bennett has been extremely
effective at stealing weapons

194
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,200
and reselling them
on the global black market.

195
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:16,800
What did he steal from GLA?

196
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,100
An advanced
inertial guidance system.

197
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,365
Well, that's not a weapon.

198
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,200
Well, fit sure looks like one when
it's put in a missile, moron.

199
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:24,400
You know,
when you call me moron,

200
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:26,265
that hurts me on the inside.

201
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,265
Bennett got away because
you couldn't open a door.

202
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,400
You're lucky your feelings aren't the only
thing that got hurt.

203
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:33,700
Technically,
I only have to sit in the van and flash.

204
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,800
Hey.

205
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,600
Guys.

206
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Gentlemen, we have intel pinpointing the location
where Bennett plans

207
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,817
to transfer the GLA technology
to his buyer.

208
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:46,300
It's a construction site
in Simi Valley.

209
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,300
I want you to stop the deal
and recover the guidance system.

210
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:50,200
We're on it.

211
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,300
You know, I wonder if it's safe
for Chuck to go on this mission.

212
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,200
Too many unforeseeable
variables.

213
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,200
In situations like this, he
has proven himself a liability.

214
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,100
I think you're right, Casey.

215
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
Chuck, you will
be sitting this one out.

216
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:02,765
What? Wait a minute.

217
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,500
You might... you might need me
to flash on something.

218
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:06,165
Oh, this country
has gotten

219
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,000
by for 200 years
without an Intersect.

220
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm sure we'll
be just fine.

221
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,400
What? Did I hurt your feelings?

222
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,200
<i>I've tried to spare
your feelings,</i>

223
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,800
but the gloves
are coming off, people.

224
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,000
I've decided to reinstitute a
time-honored Buy More tradition.

225
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Commando Wednesdays.

226
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
That tradition
never stopped.

227
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:26,200
From this day on,

228
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
this branch will hold-

229
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
wait for it-

230
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,100
an Employee of the Month
contest.

231
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:35,300
Oh! Isn't that exciting?

232
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,900
I can barely contain myself,
sir.

233
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,600
I assume you're all aware of our

234
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,600
customer
comment cards.

235
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,700
Each month, we will
tally your score and select a winner.

236
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,800
He or she

237
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,200
or whomever

238
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,065
will not only get
an 8 X 10 glossy photo

239
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,200
right beside Moses Finkelstein,
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH YOUR NAME HERE

240
00:10:57,235 --> 00:11:00,100
the CEO and founder of Buy More,

241
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,100
but there will be

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
a bonus prize!

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,100
May the best employee win.

244
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,965
Okay, so how are feeling
about this

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
about this whole
Employee-of-the-Month thing?

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,800
Um, you know what?
Whatever, Morgan.

247
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,100
I don't, I don't really care.

248
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,400
We don't care. Roger that.

249
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,700
Hey.

250
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,600
I thought you guys
would already be gone.

251
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,217
Admit it.
You need me, don't ya?

252
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:35,800
I came to make sure
you're okay.

253
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,900
Well, isn't that what all the surveillance
cameras are for?

254
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,565
Listen, I don't agree
with Casey

255
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,500
that you would be a liability
on this mission.

256
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,567
He was out of line.

257
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,565
Don't worry. I get it.

258
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,100
He thinks I let my feelings
for Jill

259
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,065
get in the way
of the mission.

260
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
But he's wrong.
I would never do that...

261
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
...again.

262
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,465
Listen, Chuck,

263
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,400
this isn't about you,
it's Casey.

264
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Casey trained with Bennett
for a long time,

265
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:58,167
and when you have a mentor
like that,

266
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,900
a real trust develops
between you,

267
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,600
and Casey feels betrayed.

268
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,565
I know it's hard,

269
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,400
but maybe you could
cut him some slack.

270
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,700
Yeah, I guess I know
how that feels.

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,500
THROUGH THESE HALLS WALK THE SMARTEST
EMPLOYEES IN THE WORLD SALES TEAM

272
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
All right, just to be absolutely
clear, our position on

273
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,700
Employee of the Month
is that we don't care,

274
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Are you guys with me?

275
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,017
Yep, not caring.

276
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,365
Not a rat's ass.

277
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,300
Not a fat
and/or hairy one.

278
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
Wait. Why don't we care again?

279
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,300
Because Employee of
the Month is a scam.

280
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,700
And working hard
is for suckers.

281
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,065
Think about it.

282
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,565
You work hard,
sales go up.

283
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,865
Sales go up,
shareholders get rich.

284
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,800
Shareholders get rich,
and we get what exactly?

285
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,065
He said something about a prize.

286
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Your face on a wall
next to Moses Finkelstein?

287
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,165
No, thank you, no.

288
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You know what?
Keep your stupid stooge prize.

289
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,800
So we get nothing?

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Emmett's gonna get
all the credit.

291
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,100
He may even get a promotion.

292
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
And then guess what?

293
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,500
One day, he's gonna be the boss.

294
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,265
So then what?

295
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,765
Then Emmett turns the Buy More

296
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,200
into a nightmare of pain
and suffering?

297
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,450
There is a solution.

298
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,500
Tell it,
tell it.

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
We have our own contest,

300
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,400
a side bet.

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
<i>We see who can get
the lowest score</i>

302
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:13,700
on their comment cards.

303
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
We beat Emmett at his own game.

304
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:18,900
Pure genius.

305
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,900
From now on,

306
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
the customers can go
service themselves.

307
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,800
In the retail sense,
Jeffrey.

308
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,200
Don't get any ideas.

309
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,600
Bennett will never show.

310
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,265
Why?

311
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,400
He's too smart
for this.

312
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,900
You get a read on the plates?

313
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,900
Look, Casey, just call Chuck.
Maybe he'll flash on it

314
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,417
and we'll know
who we're dealing with.

315
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,900
I think I'll take my
chances without him.

316
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,600
Oh, all right.

317
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:02,600
Fine.

318
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,365
Hello?

319
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,365
Hey, we just sent you an image
of a van.

320
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
Take a look at the plates,
see if you flash on it.

321
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,165
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.

322
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,800
Absolutely.
Whatever I can do to help.

323
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,865
You know, I don't have it yet.

324
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,465
It's probably
a high-resolution photo.

325
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,700
And my 3G connection gets
interference in here sometimes.

326
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,900
Spare me the Nerd Herd crap.
Get on it.

327
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:25,565
If there's intel,
we need it now!

328
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Hey, I thought you said
the U.S. government got by

329
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,600
just fine for 200 years
without the Intersect?

330
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,000
Listen, you insignificant
little puke...

331
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,665
You're on a mission.

332
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,600
Maybe surrounded
by Bennett's men.

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,300
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up.

334
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,300
Did you hang up on me?

335
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,400
No, that's crazy talk.
I would never do that.

336
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:52,300
It's a bad connection
that I had with the...

337
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,200
Hold on. Let me just look
at the picture real quick.

338
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,550
I got nothing. Sorry, no flash.

339
00:14:57,585 --> 00:14:59,200
Thanks for wasting my time.

340
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,400
Hello?

341
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,200
Hey, that's the buyer.

342
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:08,465
We're out of time.

343
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,600
Looks like we do this
the old-fashioned way.

344
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,500
- Okay? Go.
- Yeah.

345
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,365
Get out of the car!
Out of the car!

346
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,100
Take the car, man,
and I won't call the cops.

347
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,700
Hands on the car!
Put 'em on the car!

348
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,765
Who the hell are you?

349
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,665
I'm a driver. I'm here to pick

350
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,300
up a passenger
and give them that.

351
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,500
Bennett. Run! Go! Go!

352
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where

353
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:50,600
I can find John Casey?

354
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I have something
that belongs to him.

355
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,065
...Casey,

356
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,200
you say? John Casey?

357
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
You know, I'm gonna go
to the back

358
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,600
and-and-and check
on that for you.

359
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,500
So let me just... do that...
quick.

360
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Pick up the phone, John.
Pick up the phone, Casey!

361
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,500
This is Casey.

362
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Code Red! Code Red!
Redder than red!

363
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,700
It is the reddest!
It is the reddest of all hues!

364
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,365
We are Defcon One, or Five

365
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,100
or whichever means "Hurry,"
right now!

366
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,500
Bennett is at the Buy More!

367
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,100
Oh, no.

368
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,365
I'm looking for John Casey.

369
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,100
Can you tell me where
to find him?

370
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
What do I look like,
an information desk?

371
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,265
Excuse me?

372
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,500
Yes, fine, you're excused.

373
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Oh, and don't forget to fill out a customer comment card
on your way out.

374
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,765
Wise man always

375
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,300
treats a stranger with respect,

376
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,000
for he could be gazing
on the face of an enemy.

377
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,765
Hi. Sorry, sorry.

378
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,900
I just checked into
it, sir,

379
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,265
and John Casey
is unfortunately not

380
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,100
working today, and I don't know
when he's gonna be back in,

381
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,800
but you could try back
next week.

382
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,500
Uh, maybe, maybe Tuesday-ish.

383
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,700
Thank you.

384
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
You're welcome.

385
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,565
That guy was awesome!

386
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Dude, did you see
what he did to this can?

387
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,400
He did this
with his bare hands.

388
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,300
Crush, like that.
Could you imagine what he could do to a guy's face?

389
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,600
Not feeling very
chatty right now.

390
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,200
Hold on, Casey, don't hang up.

391
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm looking right at
your sensei.

392
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:57,700
Bennett's at the Buy More?

393
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,700
What? How is that possible?

394
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:01,565
<i>Was. Was at the Buy More.</i>

395
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Now he's in the Large Mart
parking garage. I'm tailing him.

396
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,500
No, stop, imbecile!
You're no match for him.

397
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:07,265
Don't be an idiot!

398
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,665
Look, you're only reacting
like this

399
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,300
because your own feelings were
hurt, okay?

400
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,900
Please don't lash out at me.

401
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,000
Where did he go?

402
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,100
Oh, God!

403
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,500
Chuck?

404
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,900
Chuck?!

405
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
Bennett's got him.
He's probably dead by now.

406
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,565
Shut up and drive!

407
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm a little tall for something
like this.

408
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,400
Is there another seating option,
perhaps?

409
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,200
Ell, are you sure
you're okay registering

410
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:30,900
for a wedding here
at the Buy More?

411
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,400
Whatever your parents want.

412
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,865
You think you may not need
a vacuum sealer,

413
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,300
but suddenly the Chief of
Surgery is coming over

414
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:40,265
with her husband
for salmon kabobs,

415
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,300
and voila, Saturday's party
turns into Sunday's picnic.

416
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,100
Why not? Can't hurt?

417
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,200
Ooh, camcorder.

418
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,400
Ah, first for the honeymoon,
then the grandkids.

419
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,600
Dad!

420
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Crossing the line.

421
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,265
Before you say
anything,

422
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,100
I know they're coming on strong,
but they're just really excited.

423
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,465
They know your parents
aren't around.

424
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,900
That's fine. I know that they're
just trying to help.

425
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,500
And you know, they're,
they're awesome.

426
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,500
Hey, Lester,
you seen Chuck?

427
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Maybe.

428
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
So, is he around?

429
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't know. Could be.

430
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,600
Can you find him for me?

431
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,465
Yeah, sure, I could,

432
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,100
but, uh, wouldn't that be more
fulfilling for you

433
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,300
if you did it yourself?

434
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,300
Look, I'm so sorry.
It's a stupid store contest.

435
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:38,700
I can help you,
but do me a solid

436
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,600
and do not mention it
on this card.

437
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,200
Yes? Thank you, buddy.

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,665
LOCKED

439
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,465
The signal from
the watch

440
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,200
is getting stronger.
Chuck's close.

441
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,300
Casey, what are you doing?

442
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:09,500
The vic can take the hit.

443
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Oh, no, not good, not good.

444
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,600
Wait. I've got Chuck.

445
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:16,700
It says the signal is...

446
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,300
the signal is right
in front of us.

447
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,900
No, Casey, stop, stop!
Chuck's in the car!

448
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:25,965
You're gonna kill Chuck!

449
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,600
Oh, fast. And he's driving very,
very fast.

450
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Casey!

451
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,700
It's actually more spacious
in here than you might think.

452
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,100
Hey!

453
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Freeze!

454
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,900
John, it's good to see you.

455
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,100
Keep your hands on your head.

456
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,100
You survived my trap.
Very good.

457
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,765
Get on your knees.

458
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,200
I followed your career, John.

459
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,600
You survived torture
at the hands of Baath separatists.

460
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:20,967
You did two years undercover
in Afghanistan.

461
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:23,300
Could you have done
any of that without me?

462
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,100
No.

463
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,900
Of course not.

464
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,700
My training saved you.

465
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,100
I came here
to ask you something.

466
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,600
Be my student again.

467
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
Take your training
to the next level.

468
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
That's it?

469
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,065
That's all you got?

470
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
That's how
you're turning the others?

471
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,800
Save your breath.
I'm no traitor.

472
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,700
Obviously,
I made a mistake.

473
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
You aren't good enough
for my team.

474
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Hey!

475
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,400
<i>So Bennett got away.</i>

476
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Again.

477
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,565
If you don't mind me asking,

478
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,750
where was the Intersect
during all of this?

479
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,642
Well, technically
I was in Bennett's trunk,

480
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,500
so I didn't see anything
that happened,

481
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:11,900
but it sounded
very exciting.

482
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,665
Wait. So, Major,

483
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,800
while you were playing
your game of chicken,

484
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,300
Chuck was in Bennett's trunk?

485
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:18,665
As soon as we
ascertained

486
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,100
the Intersect's location,
Major Casey disengaged.

487
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:23,265
Sounds like Bennett has decided

488
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,265
to make this personal, Casey,
and so have you.

489
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,400
- I'm pulling you off the case.
- With all due respect...

490
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:29,117
This is why I didn't tell you
about Bennett.

491
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:30,765
I knew you would turn it
into a vendetta.

492
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm bringing in another team to clean up your mess.

493
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,265
But I know Bennett.
I know how he operates.

494
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,600
You're forgetting
your primary objective is protecting the Intersect.

495
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,400
You will remain in Castle until the mission is completed.

496
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,600
Consider it
a cooling-off period.

497
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,700
You little...

498
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,065
I didn't know this was
going to happen.

499
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,900
I didn't know... tell him I didn't
know this was going to happen!

500
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:55,100
If my primary objective
wasn't to protect you... I KILL YOU.

501
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
I can't believe it.

502
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,400
Beckman was out of line pulling
me off this mission.

503
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:06,465
I agree with her.

504
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,100
You're too emotionally involved.

505
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,300
This from the agent that can't keep her
chocolate out of Bartowski's peanut butter.

506
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:14,417
Whatever my feelings
may be for Chuck,

507
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:16,500
I never knowingly endangered the asset.

508
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:17,665
You let your anger

509
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,600
toward Bennett cloud
your judgment.

510
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,800
You finally admit that you do
have feelings for the nerd.

511
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,765
No, all I will admit to
is having feelings.

512
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,300
20 years in the business
has taught me one sure thing-

513
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,200
that people...
people let you down in the end.

514
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,900
Well, it's nice to know
where we stand.

515
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,700
Did you talk to Casey?

516
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,900
Is he mad?

517
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:46,965
I feel horrible.

518
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,800
Casey is always mad.
That's his baseline.

519
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I never should have said
all that stuff in front of the general.

520
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,250
No, your assessment
was accurate.

521
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:56,000
I mean, the facts
are the facts.

522
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,450
True, but the guy's
going through a lot.

523
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,192
If I were really a friend,
I would look past

524
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:00,900
what he's saying and remember
how he's feeling.

525
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,300
I mean, I should know
better than anybody

526
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:03,700
what he's going through
right now.

527
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,400
Chuck, you're so sweet.

528
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,950
But, you know, an apology
is not going to work,

529
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:13,542
because Casey is combat ready
at all times.

530
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,100
Which means his feelings
are liabilities.

531
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,800
Well, aren't you supposed
to be combat ready at all times?

532
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,400
I'll meet you at your
sister's wedding tasting after your Buy More shift.

533
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:29,800
And please,
don't go downstairs.

534
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,000
Leave Casey alone.

535
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,900
If it isn't
Tweedledee, Tweedledum

536
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,100
and... Tweedledumber.

537
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,300
Oh, congratulations
goes out to you.

538
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
What do we win,
a prize or something?

539
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,700
Well, of all the incompetent
employees in this backwater branch,

540
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,665
you three have
distinguished yourselves-

541
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,300
with the lowest
customer evaluation scores in recorded history.

542
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,100
Really?

543
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,000
- What... how low exactly?
- Are we talking like

544
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,465
truly abysmal, or...?

545
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,300
Combined your highest score
was a one.

546
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:08,100
- Dare to dream, baby.
- All right.

547
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,665
Well, since none of you
seem to be taking

548
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
this Employee of the Month
contest very seriously,

549
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,400
I must abandon the carrot,
and use my stick.

550
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,500
You sure that's legal?

551
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,900
From now on, the employee
with the lowest scores

552
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,400
will close up
every Saturday night

553
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,900
- for an entire month.
- All right, stop.

554
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:28,400
You can't do this
to us, okay?

555
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,565
I'm sorry, I can't?

556
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,700
- Saturday's are sacred.
- I can't work on Shabbat.

557
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah. It's date night.

558
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
Laundry night?

559
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
- It's two-for-one night.
- You're wasting time.

560
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,900
You have one night
to raise your scores.

561
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,400
You better get crackin'.

562
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,865
This is my employee
discount card.

563
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,100
It's good for 20% off
anything in the store. Go nuts.

564
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,800
Just put in a good word
for me on your way out.

565
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,100
No, mind?

566
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,900
Why would I mind?

567
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,550
Just let me get this puppy
loaded up for you

568
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,800
and then I'll come right back
for sub...

569
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,500
Four stars?!

570
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I just kissed your ass
for four lousy stars?!

571
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,700
What do you people
want from me!

572
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Just spit in my
face next time!

573
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,500
Hey, Jeff.

574
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,400
How's it going, man?
You all right?

575
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,200
I think I'm getting the hang
of this customer service stuff.

576
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,200
ENTER

577
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,800
Yeah...

578
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
ACCESS DENIED

579
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,700
Casey, hey.
Hey, how you doing?

580
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Get down here.

581
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,065
Um, look, I'm glad you called,
because I was actually going

582
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,600
- to call you to say sorry... - I don't care
if it's your time of the month, Bartowski.

583
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:12,700
Get down here please.

584
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,100
I don't...
I don't think I can.

585
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,400
Sarah said not to.

586
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Listen, buddy...

587
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
I started training
under Ty Bennett

588
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:25,100
when I was 23 years old.

589
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
I was an idiot back then.

590
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,200
I wasn't good enough
to qualify for his program,

591
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,265
but he took me on anyway.

592
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,600
You know, so, he taught me
everything I know-

593
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,100
self-discipline,

594
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:37,100
duty.

595
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't know
what to think here, pal.

596
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,300
I'm feeling kind of exposed.

597
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,900
I feel like my whole foundation
has been undermined here.

598
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,900
He was like, a...

599
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,965
I can't talk about this
over the phone.

600
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
No, no, I'm glad you're finally
opening up to me.

601
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,400
Be right there.

602
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,400
Thanks, buddy.

603
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,865
Hey...

604
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,400
Hey, buddy, I'm sorry, I got
here as fast as I could.

605
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,765
And I wanted
to tell you seriously

606
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
what I was saying
on the phone earlier-

607
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:08,965
I am sorry, man.

608
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,900
I know, your sensei from the
past... it's very personal...

609
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:13,465
- Yeah.
- Hey! Hey!

610
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,800
Let go.
What are you doing?

611
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,465
Oh, oh, gentle.

612
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,800
Now, Intersect, flash.

613
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,800
This is the surveillance
footage from the crash.

614
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,300
Casey, it doesn't work
like that, okay?

615
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,000
I can't just flash on cue...

616
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,900
Okay, okay,
1919 Mulholland Drive.

617
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:37,865
It's a martial arts dojo,

618
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,600
but also a cover for
Bennett's illegal activity.

619
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,700
Good work, Intersect.

620
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,100
You know, I think
you should reconsider

621
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,665
this whole cooling-off period.

622
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,550
I think General Beckman was
onto something when she said you

623
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:49,400
- should stay down here...
- Come on, I need that eyeball.

624
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,665
Casey, what has
gotten into you?!

625
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
What is going on? This is
totally uncharacteristic...

626
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:00,765
I've never seen you
disobey an order.

627
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
What are you, nuts,
crazy, out of your mind?

628
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,900
Okay, that's it-
I'm calling Sarah.

629
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:05,665
You know what, Chuck?

630
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,800
I think I might owe
you an apology now.

631
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,600
That's very nice of you.

632
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:10,265
Huh? What's it for?

633
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,700
The lying, the name-calling,
the emotional manipulation?

634
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:14,000
Nope. For this.

635
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,065
Wait, no, no.

636
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,065
No, Casey, no, no, no, wait,
wait wait. You don't understand.

637
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,900
I have dinner with Ellie tonight and we're tasting food
for her wedding.

638
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:22,865
I can't miss it.

639
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,200
You know, when I was
Bennett's student,

640
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:25,800
I struggled with my calm.

641
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,900
He said I held too much anger
and that made me weak.

642
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,700
Sometimes when I see
your face, Bartowski,

643
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:33,800
my calm center just wants to...

644
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,700
You tell anyone where I'm going,

645
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,700
and this is yours.

646
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,400
What? Hey!

647
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,600
Use the Force.
Use the Force, Chuck.

648
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,500
So, you're sure it's all right
to start without Chuck?

649
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,600
- Yeah, he has a tendency to run late.
- Yeah, it's like the kid's

650
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,100
in his own world
half the time.

651
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,965
Must drive you crazy, Sarah.

652
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,550
Oh, I'm pretty
used to it, actually.

653
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:13,100
And Chuck always
has a good excuse.

654
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,500
So we are all
in agreement then?

655
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,965
Yes to the trout,

656
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,500
<i>no to the beef au jus.</i>

657
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,100
And what was
your favorite cake, Ellie?

658
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:22,165
- Um...
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

659
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
- Let's agree on the red velvet.
- Big fan.

660
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:25,500
And I love sorbet
between courses.

661
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:26,665
Great idea, Woody.

662
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,300
So, are you going
to wear your hair up?

663
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:29,065
Wait a second...

664
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,600
I just had
a brilliant idea.

665
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,665
White ties.

666
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,465
Woody looks so handsome
in a white tie.

667
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,250
- That's not too formal is it?
- I don't know.

668
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:36,965
And I know you're not
in contact with your dad,

669
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,100
so I would be honored, really,
to walk you down the aisle on your wedding day.

670
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,800
You know, guys, maybe we should
just table the wedding talk.

671
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,165
Um, no.

672
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
I have something
I'd like to say, actually.

673
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,300
Um, I said yes to the big
wedding and I said yes

674
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:57,000
to the burgundy organza
bridesmaid dresses,

675
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:59,965
and I just can't
say yes anymore.

676
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,200
And I'm sorry, I know that
you're trying to help,

677
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,800
but the answer is no.

678
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,100
I'm sorry... I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

679
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,300
Babe...

680
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Sorry.

681
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,000
Sweetie...

682
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,100
sweetheart...

683
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,100
Sweetheart?

684
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Well, Sarah...

685
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,200
so you're in the yogurt game?

686
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:24,100
Yeah.

687
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,600
Yeah, yogurt.

688
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,700
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

689
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,600
Yeah, yeah.

690
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Yes.

691
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,900
- Woody...
- Huh?

692
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,200
I think we should go for a walk
and give the kids some time to themselves.

693
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,965
Oh, it's Ellie's phone.

694
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,500
Oh, it's Chuck.
Should I answer it?

695
00:31:59,535 --> 00:32:01,100
Oh, I'll take it.
Thank you.

696
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,200
Hey, Chuck, where are you?

697
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Sarah, Sarah, thank God.

698
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,065
Listen, um...

699
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,165
Casey threatened my life,

700
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,965
- so technically I can't tell you...
- What?

701
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,600
Well, you could guess though.
Yeah, you could guess.

702
00:32:12,635 --> 00:32:14,100
Chuck,
I don't have time for games.

703
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:14,765
Just guess!

704
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,700
I'll tell you if you're
hot or cold.

705
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,265
And FYI,

706
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,765
this place is very cold.

707
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,700
It's... it's practically frozen.

708
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,050
You're at Orange Orange.

709
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:24,300
Bingo! Yes, you're amazing!

710
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Let me guess- you went down
into the Castle and Casey

711
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:27,365
used you to get out and
then he locked you

712
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,700
in the Orange Orange and now
he's going after Bennett.

713
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,200
Wow. That's very impressive.
How did you...?

714
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:34,265
Okay. Where did he go?

715
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,600
You didn't hear this from me.
1919 Mulholland Drive.

716
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:37,700
Can you get out?

717
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,065
No. No. Not until
you get down here

718
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,800
and get the key to get me
out of these handcuffs.

719
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,365
Good. Then stay there.

720
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,000
What? No, no, no! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait, Sarah! No, no! Wait!

721
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,800
<i>Those seven years of MacGyver
finally paid off.</i>

722
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,600
You shouldn't be here.

723
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,200
You want to stop me,
you're going to have to kill me.

724
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,165
Well, I'm your partner,

725
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
and I'm not letting
you go in alone.

726
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,700
Okay.

727
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Come on.

728
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,900
Um... computer emergency?

729
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,800
I was waiting in the car.

730
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,700
I swear.

731
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Hello, John.

732
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,300
And friends.

733
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,000
This is unfortunate.

734
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,900
No matter where you run, where you hide,

735
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I'm going
to be there,

736
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,900
waiting.

737
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,300
Please be careful.

738
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Always so proud,

739
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
so righteous, John.

740
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,500
But I have business to attend to.

741
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,600
I can't have you interfering.

742
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,000
I thought you
were a man of honor.

743
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,100
If I'm not good enough
to make your team,

744
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
surely you could defeat me without the gun.

745
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
Withhonor.

746
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,500
You're right.

747
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
My students,

748
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,065
this is a special lesson:

749
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,200
How to kill a man with honor.
It will happen

750
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,900
very quickly.

751
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,000
Eye of the tiger, buddy.

752
00:35:31,035 --> 00:35:32,200
Shut up, Chuck.

753
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,400
Sorry.

754
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
We're in trouble, aren't we?

755
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,800
Use the snake on him.
Get around him.

756
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,500
Come on!
Come on!

757
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:20,567
Casey, hit him!

758
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:21,600
He's outmatched.

759
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,500
You lost your calm, John.

760
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,100
Your center

761
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,800
is filled with conflict.

762
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,200
That's it.

763
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,450
Casey... Casey!
Casey, you gotta get up.

764
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:44,600
- You gotta get up.
- Run for it, Chuck. Go.

765
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,000
It's too bad,
really.

766
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,265
I was hoping my
men would see

767
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,700
better skills
from a former student of mine.

768
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Look. Look, I get how you're
feeling, man. I totally

769
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:54,100
get how you're feeling.
You're feeling betrayed

770
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,600
by someone that
you really care about.

771
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,865
You're damaging my calm, Chuck.

772
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,800
You've spent so much of your life-
pushing people away.

773
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:04,000
Lashing out with purple words
and... and punches.

774
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,065
But I know why you do it.

775
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,800
You do it because you're scared.

776
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:07,565
What?

777
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,265
Scared. Scared to be known.

778
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,800
Scared that, if we see
who you really are,

779
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:12,500
we'd actually care about you.

780
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,465
You shut up!

781
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,100
Yeah. Shut up, Chuck.
You're making him mad.

782
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,100
Underneath that extremely
terrifying exterior lies a man

783
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:21,167
who deeply, deeply feels.

784
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:23,200
You care. You care about us.

785
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,200
You care about me.
Admit it. You feel all

786
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:26,700
warm and mushy about me.

787
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,600
Go ahead. Say it.

788
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,500
You love me, John Casey.

789
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,665
I'm going to kill you!

790
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,500
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on.
No. Not me.

791
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,800
Him.

792
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,600
Nice work, sensei.

793
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:51,765
Yeah. Well,

794
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,200
the thing is, Casey doesn't
really have a calm center.

795
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,900
It's more of an angry center.

796
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,300
There he is.

797
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,165
There's your sensei.

798
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,400
Take a good
look at him.

799
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Who's next?

800
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,500
Hands on your heads!

801
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,100
You called Beckman.

802
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,600
What? It's not my fault.

803
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
She guessed.

804
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
<i>And now it's time
to announce this month's</i>

805
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:40,500
Employee of the Month.

806
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,800
And, for what
it's worth, you all tried your... best.

807
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,600
The employee with
the highest level

808
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:55,200
of customer service is...

809
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,100
Skip Johnson!

810
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,300
It's not my fault.
I tried to be a jerk.

811
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:05,100
Oh, congratulations!

812
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,200
Clearly, there is no prize that I could
give you

813
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,165
that would compare to the satisfaction
of having

814
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,700
your name and photo immortalized
on a Buy More plaque.

815
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:17,600
What did I tell ya?

816
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:19,100
So lame.

817
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,165
However,
please accept

818
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,900
this one-time only bonus gift.

819
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,600
A 65-inch flat screen TV.

820
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,200
Well, thanks for saving my life
today, Chuck.

821
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:44,465
Anytime, Casey.
Yeah.

822
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,700
You know what?
You're my friend.

823
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,700
Yeah. You know what?
You're my friend, too.

824
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,365
Well, that's really kind

825
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,200
of you, Casey.
Have a good night.

826
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,600
Thank you.

827
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,300
You said something, didn't you?
You said something.

828
00:39:58,335 --> 00:39:59,300
You said something!

829
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,100
I heard that. I heard that.

830
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,200
Hey.

831
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,300
Sorry I missed
tonight.

832
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,900
I got stuck at work.

833
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,000
It's okay.
Sarah told me.

834
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,600
Uh... Where are
Awesome's parents?

835
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,700
He's, um... he's taking
them to the airport.

836
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,800
I really am sorry about
missing the dinner, Ell.

837
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,765
I mean, I know
it's important for you

838
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,200
to let your future in-laws
meet your family and...

839
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,300
You know, I, um...

840
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,265
I've never been
one of those girls

841
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,900
that dreamed about what
their wedding day would be like.

842
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,900
What I would wear.

843
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,350
Even the person
that I would marry.

844
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:43,100
It was all kind
of, uh... kind of hazy.

845
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Except... except
one thing was clear-

846
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,600
That Dad would walk me
down the aisle.

847
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,500
Hey, Ellie.

848
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,665
I know it's not
going to happen.

849
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,100
It's just... it's just really
hard to let go of that.

850
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,700
ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.

851
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,400
The number you have reached
is not in service.

852
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,500
What is it?

853
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,100
Dad's going to walk
you down the aisle.

854
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,200
You can't say that, Chuck.

855
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,965
I know that you
want that for me,

856
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,800
but we haven't heard from him
in a really long time.

857
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah. Well,
I'm going to find him.

858
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,100
I'm a smart guy.

859
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:58,000
I can do that.

860
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,900
And, when he hears
about the wedding,

861
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,200
he'll be here for you.

862
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
Come on. You really
think he's going to make it?

863
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,165
I guarantee it.

864
