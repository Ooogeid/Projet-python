00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:03,135
<i>Hey, i'm chuck. Here are a few things
that you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,849
Jill, hey. I can help you.

3
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,196
Come on.

4
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,369
You're under arrest, Jill.
And i'm breaking up with you.

5
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,129
Dad's gone. I thougt i needed him
to walk me down the aisle,

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,437
I thought that he would be different
from that guy who walked out on us.

7
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,926
Don't worry, Charles.
I'm not who you think i am.

8
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:19,972
You're Orion.

9
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:23,404
I'll give Fulcrum their Intersect.
But my son walks away from here.

10
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:25,440
Take care of yourself.

11
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:28,237
As soon as my dad finished
the new intersect,

12
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:30,320
I'm worthless to you.
And Fulcrum wins.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,512
The only thing that matters now
is getting my father back.

14
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:44,395
Fro-yo?

15
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:48,461
It's time to try our latest flavor,
Obama Guava.

16
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,764
I didn't make up the name.
-Uh, no, thanks.

17
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:55,894
No that i'm not thrilled that the CIA
has found a new yogurt recipe, i was just...

18
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,546
I don't know, kinda hoping the CIA
would find my father first.

19
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:01,861
The government is doing anything
they can to find him.

20
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:03,639
How would i know i can trust them?

21
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,003
The government wants to keep
the intersect in my head.

22
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:09,470
My father is the only person
who can get it out. It's not rocket science.

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,853
Okay, i know that you don't trust them
but do you trust me?

24
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:17,499
Yeah.

25
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:20,628
Good. Then i promise you
we're gonna find him.

26
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,484
Well, hurry, please.

27
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:24,282
<i>What's the matter, Chuck?

28
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:28,097
You're dad's back in town, right?
You're dating the hottest slice of a BBQ pizza.

29
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:30,737
And you are best friends with me.

30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,548
Which means,
two out of three ins of bad, right?

31
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:34,008
Come on. You're king of the world, dude.

32
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,070
Bartowski, get it together.

33
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:38,149
Yeah. King of the world.

34
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:40,871
Emmet got an announcement.
So listen up.

35
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:42,432
Aye aye, captain.

36
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:48,576
All right, now, sometimes
over the next 24 hours,

37
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:52,829
a Buy-More corporate evaluator
will be here to evaluate yours truly.

38
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,824
Now, normally in this situation,
i would expect to certain...

39
00:01:56,844 --> 00:02:00,550
tribe* to use this oppurtunity
to make me look bad.

40
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,092
Laugh it up, cretins.

41
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:07,297
The tech jobs are being shipped
to India faster than you can say,

42
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:11,198
"Would you like fries and a soft drink with that?"
-I can't work fast food, Emmet.

43
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,793
I keep kosher.
-Count me in on the trip to India.

44
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:16,430
I've always dreamt seeing
Lester in his native enviroment.

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,484
What?
-You test me,

46
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:22,036
and you'll be flipping burgers in
Encino for the rest of your miserable life.

47
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:24,838
Now, let's show corporate

48
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:28,456
that we are *lean, mean, Buy-More machine.

49
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:31,037
So comb your hair.
-Jealous.

50
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,235
Lower that *whore skirt.
-Excuse me?

51
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,737
And for god's sakes, Barnes...

52
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:39,683
I am tired of seeing your but crack.

53
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,385
Pull 'em up!

54
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:45,569
Well, that went well.

55
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,605
Hey. Updates from Beckman.

56
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:50,337
Yeah? Is it information about
where my father is?

57
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:52,836
We're about to find out.
Come on.

58
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,057
I mean, people, do you have any idea

59
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,682
what working with fried food
will do to my complexion?

60
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:02,896
Can't leave the Buy-More.
I won't survive in the real world.

61
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,210
I'm institutionalized.

62
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,912
Morgan, we are the brains
of this operation.

63
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:09,020
So let's you and i
come up with something.

64
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,603
Why don'y you start us off?
-What? As i see it,

65
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:14,928
Emmet's threat was a ruse
to get us to work hard,

66
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:17,493
So he would look good
in front of corporate. Think about this.

67
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:20,922
Emmet's asked us to behave becuase
he knows we would do the exact opposite.

68
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:24,049
We misbehave. But Emmet, he's no fool...

69
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,006
So he would know that we
would know that he knows this.

70
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,249
So obviously, we need to behave.

71
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,972
Okay, so we behave.

72
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:33,802
Pay attention. It's the exact opposite.

73
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:37,002
Emmett would also know that we'd
know that he knows we know,

74
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:40,184
<i>because he knows that we know that what he knows

75
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:43,040
is that we know he wants us to behave.

76
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,204
Right! Yes!

77
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:49,897
Yes. I don't know how we do it,
but we are geniuses, my friend.

78
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,477
Thank you.
<i>-So, what are we doing again?</i>

79
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:54,556
God, I love technology.

80
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:56,053
What we are doing again

81
00:03:56,073 --> 00:03:58,837
<i>is we're going to let Rome burn.

82
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,055
<i>We've used every resource
to find him with no luck.

83
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>I'm sorry, Chuck.

84
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:09,005
<i>FULCRUM's kept a tight lid on
your father's whereabouts.

85
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,519
That's your update?

86
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,385
Well, I'm sorry, but that's a non-update.
And you know what? It's not good enough.

87
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,938
Watch it, Bartowski. It's a U.S.
general you're talking to.

88
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:20,453
I've spent the last year of my life
being tortured, dangled off of skyscrapers,

89
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:21,715
bathed in sewage.

90
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:25,153
Stop me if I've forgotten
any other glamorous perks of this job.

91
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:27,571
I've continually done everything
that you guys have asked me to do,

92
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,838
but once my dad gets kidnapped,
all you can say is sorry?

93
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,098
<i>Chuck, I understand your disappointment

94
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:35,368
Do you? Then why haven't we found him yet?

95
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,706
We've captured FULCRUM agents before.
Can't we talk to them?

96
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:41,891
Yeah, we tried that, but since the new
administration discontinued water-boarding,

97
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:43,437
FULCRUM agents don't talk.

98
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:46,169
And even if we did, we have no reason to trust them.

99
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm willing to do whatever it takes
by any means necessary.

100
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:55,635
So what if I could get a FULCRUM agent to talk?

101
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:00,191
<i>You're 100% sure you want
to go through with this?

102
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,504
<i>More like 45,

103
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,470
<i>maybe... maybe 30.

104
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,936
<i>But I guess I don't really
have any other choice now, do I?

105
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,402
Hi, Chuck.

106
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:28,946
Hello, Jill.

107
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:35,307
- Chuck -
- Season 2 Ep 20 -

108
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:39,408
<i>Fixed to perfection by:
Mithrandir

109
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,509
<i>All the thanks to italiansubs!

110
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,535
So, how's the food?

111
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:14,799
Standard prison issue, or are they doing
anything fancy with the sauces?

112
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,196
What are you doing here, Chuck?

113
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,165
FULCRUM has kidnapped my father.

114
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:26,585
They're using him to rebuild their Intersect,

115
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:28,689
and when he's done...

116
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:34,151
Look, I don't even want to think about what's
gonna happen when that happens.

117
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:37,268
Let me guess.
You want my help?

118
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,010
Forget it.
-I get that you're mad at me,

119
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,595
but it's not my fault you're in here.

120
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:43,667
You betrayed your country.

121
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:46,808
Yho betrayed me.

122
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,998
I thought you cared about me,

123
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:53,114
but now, all I'm asking is formy family back, please.

124
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:56,795
I might be able to help.

125
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:58,726
But I want a deal.

126
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,476
Do not make a deal. Do not make a deal!

127
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:04,423
I'm-I'm not... I'm not really authorized
to make any kind of deal.

128
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:08,621
But in this case, I think
I can make an exception.

129
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,537
Do I work here?

130
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:32,109
No, no. I just wear this
ridiculous outfit

131
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:34,478
so that people like you will ask me if I do.

132
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:43,368
Emmett asked me to give this to you.

133
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:49,186
Mighty fine cart work.

134
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,500
Emmett?

135
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,254
Hello?

136
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:05,588
Got this... Got this note.

137
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,666
Milbarge.
-Grimes.

138
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,432
Let me cut to the chase. I despise you.
But these losers listen to you for some reason,

139
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:20,011
so I need you.
-Talk to me.

140
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,450
I was brought here to make this store efficient.

141
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,309
If corporate sees that, they will have no recourse but to do the

142
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:28,485
efficient thing and promote me out of this hellhole.

143
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,040
Get your little merry band of misfits
to behave,

144
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,847
and I'll be out of your dirty beard forever.

145
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,812
How do I know that I can... trust you?
-You don't,

146
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:44,573
but I want out, and you want me out,

147
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:46,035
so let's...

148
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:49,137
...make a deal.

149
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,450
I can't believe we made this deal.

150
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,454
If you run or double-cross us,

151
00:08:56,464 --> 00:09:00,071
your deal is void. Plus, as an added bonus,
she'll shoot you.

152
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:04,567
Chuck's dad- where is he?
-I don't know exactly,

153
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:07,187
but I do know someone who might know
where they're holding him.

154
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,531
Who?
-My Uncle Bernie.

155
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:10,792
That better not be a joke,
'cause I don't have a sense of humor.

156
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,777
Yeah, I don't remember you ever mentioning
an Uncle Bernie to mewhen we were dating.

157
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:16,762
He's not a real uncle.
He's a friend of the family.

158
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,941
He's the one who first recruited me into FULCRUM.
-And how do we know we can trust him?

159
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,315
He's my dad's best friend.

160
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,596
If there's one person I can trust, it's him.

161
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,672
Where's Bernie? We'll flush him out,
torture the location out of him.

162
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:31,005
He's guarded almost 24 hours a day.
-What does almost mean?

163
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,964
Yeah, when is Bernie away from his bodyguards?
-Usually only for family functions.

164
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:38,672
Are there any coming up?
Birthdays, confirmations, quiceaneras?

165
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:44,152
Well, then, I guess we're going to have to
create one on our own.

166
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,988
I'm engaged.
-It's Tacori. It's beautiful.

167
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,111
Oh, well, thanks, Judy.
-No, call me Mom.

168
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:57,432
Most girls only get four C's with a ring,
but, uh, my Jill- she got five.

169
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,929
<i>Cut, color, clarity, carat, and Chuck.

170
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,690
<i>Isn't this gorgeous?

171
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,535
That ring cost the taxpayers
a fortune, Bartowski.

172
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,847
<i>Don't lose it.

173
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,918
Here they are.
Mr. and Mrs.Bartowski.

174
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:19,264
So, Jill, this is such a wonderful surprise.

175
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:22,673
We thought she was living in Helsinki. We...
We didn't know when we'd see her again.

176
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,948
Well, Chuck popped the question,
and I wanted to share it with everybody.

177
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:29,720
Well, Wally,
I think this calls for a toast.

178
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,485
No, no, no, Dad. You don't... You don't have to do that.
-Listen, I have waited

179
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,467
all my life for my little girl to get married-
you bet I do.

180
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,637
I remember when you first met at Stanford,

181
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:48,122
the way you'd look at each other...
Just like your mom and I did.

182
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:51,385
And I know you've had your problems, but

183
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:53,783
deep inside,

184
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:56,777
<i>you knew you were right for each other.

185
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,323
And you never let anything get in the way of that.

186
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:03,069
To Jill and Chuck.

187
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,210
To Jill and Chuck!

188
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:09,635
Congratulations, Bartowski.
You're now qualified for conjugal visits.

189
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,192
<i>There's a car approaching.
This could be him.

190
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:15,081
<i>Bartowski, this guy's a madman.

191
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:20,016
<i>His codename's "The Carnivore."
Seems he's got a real appetite for blood.

192
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,479
<i>Great.

193
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:31,092
Hey, Bernie, how are you?!
-Great, Wally.

194
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,975
So, what is this big surprise
you couldn't tell me over the phone?

195
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,177
Jill's engaged!

196
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,659
Jill's here? Where?

197
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:44,127
You are so adorable, Chuck.
You two are gonna have the most beautiful babies.

198
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,612
I want a girl and a boy.

199

<i>Out of towner downs 96 Ouncer

201
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:59,343
I'm sorry, Chuck, is all this talk of children
scaring you?

202
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,466
No, no, no, I love kids, really, yeah.

203
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,751
JILL!

204
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,753
I thought you moved to Helsinki.
-You're not the only one, Bernie.

205
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:09,776
You really need to come home more often.

206
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:14,811
Yeah, I-I barely get to see her myself.
She works so much, she might as well be in prison.

207
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:17,624
so you're the lucky guy, huh?

208
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:21,185
It's Chuck, nice to meet you, Bernie.

209
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,922
No, no, no. You call me Uncle Bernie.
We're family now.

210
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:29,954
We were just telling them that the key
to a good marriage is trust.

211
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:34,469
Your spouse must be the only
person you always rely on,

212
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,363
who'll never betray you.

213
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:39,036
you mind if I, uh, borrow the happy couple?

214
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:42,615
I got a few words of wisdom myself.
-Okay.

215
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,470
Good luck!

216
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:51,435
Bernie didn't like Jill's last boyfriend and...
that's the last we saw of him.

217
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,154
Is that so?

218
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:03,591
What are you doing here, Jill?
I thought you were in jail.

219
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:06,503
I made a deal with the CIA.
-What? What kind of a deal?

220
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:09,292
Look, Bernie, all you have to do is
tell us where FULCRUM is hiding my father

221
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,199
and we can offer you witness protection, too.

222
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:17,140
Oh, you stupid little... Are you wired?
-No, we're not.

223
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:20,322
Are you wired?!
-Yes, yes, we are.

224
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,643
They're gone.
-Let's go.

225
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:24,764
No, we can't just blast in and
blow Chuck's cover.

226
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,978
Oh, my. Look how happy my baby is.

227
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:34,487
I'm sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to tell you
that dinner's almost ready, okay?

228
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,510
Thanks, Judy.
-Don't torture them too much, Bernie.

229
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:43,035
Jill!

230
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,305
<i>Oh, no, no!

231
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:47,612
Come on, come on, come on!

232
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,300
Hi.
Hi.

233
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:54,598
And you are?
-I'm Chuck's cousin, Sarah.

234
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,569
And this is my boyfriend, John.

235
00:13:56,604 --> 00:14:00,206
Talk about beauty and the beast, huh?
You must be loaded!

236
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:05,211
Just a little friendly ribbing.
We're family now!

237
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,561
Yeah, family.

238
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,342
This is my lovely wife, Judy.
Hello.

239
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,785
Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

240
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,360
Yeah, so, where's the lucky couple, hmm?

241
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:14,410
They're having a sit down with, uh,
Uncle Bernie. And if I know him,

242
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,430
Chuck is dead meat by now.

243
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:19,071
Casey, Sarah, third floor!

244
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:21,854
<i>We're in trouble! I don't know
if he wants to kill me or eat me!

245
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,894
Is the bathroom upstairs, I hope?

246
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,884
I have to... we had a very long drive.

247
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,754
Where are we going?
-The attic.

248
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,950
The only way out is up.

249
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:41,017
hey, Casey and Sarah, we're in the attic, we
need some help, A lot of help!

250
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,462
Window!

251
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:43,724
Jill!

252
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,459
Bernie, please don't do this.

253
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:49,618
You can't shoot us
because the whole family will hear it.

254
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:52,549
You're right; I can't.

255
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:55,773
But I can beat you to death.

256
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:59,306
I was really hoping for a third option
that did not include death.

257
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,278
Chuck, are you okay?

258
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:17,313
Yeah.

259
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:21,376
Congratulations, Bartowski.
It's your first confirmed kill.

260
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,076
Kill? No! No, no, no, no.

261
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:26,108
I didn't kill anybody, okay?
He just died; it was an accident.

262
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,335
Well, maybe he had a heart attack.

263
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,078
What do you call your move, anyway?

264
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:31,415
What move?

265
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,787
The girlie pose I saw you in.
What do you call that?

266
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:35,818
The Morgan.
-The Morgan?

267
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,151
He invented it in high school
when girls were beating him up.

268
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:42,594
You kind of duck a little bit, protect the
important... You know, your face and your...

269
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,219
What are we gonna do?!

270
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:46,437
We were telling him about our wedding plans,

271
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,842
and he just kept knocking back scotches
until

272
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,489
the next thing we knew he was dead drunk.

273
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,021
Uh, call me, Bernie!
-Yeah, get some rest!

274
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,067
Okay.

275
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,254
Yeah, we should get him home.
-Okay.

276
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,452
I love you. Take care of yourself.

277
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:13,547
Good-bye, everyone!
-Coungratulations!

278
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:15,880
See ya!
-Thanks!

279
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:18,567
We'll take care of Bernie.

280
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:23,140
Way to go, killer. You just offed the only person
who knows where your dad is

281
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,663
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

282
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,092
Wow, Morgan.
They look great.

283
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:40,460
I may look good, but I feel like an idiot.

284
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,621
Anybody sees or hears about this,
my rep is ruined.

285
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,653
Can you relax? Relax and trust me, please.

286
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,868
This is the only way
we're gonna get Emmett out of our hair.

287
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:49,021
No pain, no gain, remember?

288
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:53,336
As you can see, we're running
smoother than a Swiss watch.

289
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,912
You'll find no finer example of Buy More
employees in the land.

290
00:16:56,947 --> 00:17:00,676
Mr. Patel here is one of our certified
computer technicians.

291
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:04,200
Very pleased to meet you, sir.
-And may I just say,

292
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:08,055
I would do pretty much
anything for this man. He is...

293
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,802
...somewhat of a hero around here.

294
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,706
A constant brownnoser.
Well, he was born brown.

295
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:20,738
May I go a step further and say that,
uh, to me, Emmett is the straw

296
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,053
that gently stirs the Buy More drink.

297
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:27,584
I can't tell you how many times I
defiled myself at work.

298
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:31,543
Emmett cured me of that.
Now I only violate  myself at home

299
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:35,386
or in the car.
But never in the Nerd Herder.

300
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,449
He has made such progress under Mr. Milbarge's...

301
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,482
...tutelage. We're all so proud.

302
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:46,265
I'm your captain.
-Yes, captain, my captain.

303
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,555
Let me show you around.

304
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:52,062
You better be right about this, Morgan.

305
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:55,372
Yes, General, I understand.

306
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:58,720
Sarah, what's happening?
-We're moving Jill back to prison.

307
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,874
What? No, we can't..
We can't send her back.

308
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:03,464
We haven't found my father yet.
She still might know somethingand we had a deal.

309
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,463
Chuck, I'm sorry but the mission was a bust

310
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:06,873
and Jill only put us into more danger.

311
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:09,877
That wasn't her fault! It was Bernie! He
manipulated and betrayed her!

312
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:12,025
You know Jill.
She's a FULCRUM agent.

313
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,001
Exactly! That's exactly why we need her.
She knows FULCRUM; their procedures and secrets.

314
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,028
Look, I know she tried to kill you
and I'm sorry about that,

315
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:23,458
but she is the best chance I have
at rescuing my father.

316
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,659
He's out there somewhere and God only knows
what's happening to him.

317
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:29,582
Chuck, you have to realize that there are some
people that you just cannot trust.

318
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,338
Sarah...

319
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:33,657
I already know that.

320
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,543
I don't trust anyone.

321
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,206
Except for you.

322
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:41,340
And right now I need you to trust me.

323
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,990
Jill is the only way I'm gonna get my dad back.

324
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:51,963
Chuck, the answer is no.

325
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:00,994
Hey, buddy.

326
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,425
Chuck, where you been, man?
I've been calling you all day.

327
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:05,896
I'm sorry, buddy, I've just been a
little a little busy, that's all.

328
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:06,769
<i>All right, well, listen,

329
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,605
we have a situation here at the Buy More
and I could really use your help.

330
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:13,171
I'm on an install.
I- I can't help you right now.

331
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:15,313
Okay, well, just bear with me for one second here, okay?

332
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:17,839
What do you do when the person
that you think you can trust the least

333
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:21,183
<i>can actually get you the thing you want the most?

334
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,536
You know what, Morgan?

335
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,214
Sometimes you just need to trust a person.

336
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:32,848
Do whatever it takes.

337
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:33,930
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.

338
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,897
Roger that.
Thanks, buddy.

339
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,168
I'm sorry.

340
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,552
They're sending you back to prison.

341
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,139
Well, it's not your fault.

342
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:08,282
At least I got to see my family one last time.

343
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,727
I'm sorry I couldn't help you, Chuck.

344
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:13,762
It's okay.

345
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:16,441
I'm sorry about your Uncle Bernie.

346
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,042
I had no idea The Morgan was so lethal.

347
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:25,007
I'm glad you haven't lost your sense of humor.

348
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:27,688
They changed me.

349
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:31,668
Promise me that you won't let them change you.

350
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:33,779
I'll do my best.

351
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:38,307
I liked wearing this.

352
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,910
Even if it was just for a few hours.

353
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:59,547
They were never gonna let me go,

354
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:01,577
even if we found your dad, were they?

355
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,012
NSA, FULCRUM, CIA- they're all the same.
They all lie.

356
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:10,476
They're not gonna let you go either, Chuck.

357
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:12,754
Watch your back.

358
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:20,664
Skip, I can tell you got a bright future
ahead of you. It's a pleasure meeting you.

359
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:29,276
Well? When are you out of here?
We've done everything that you asked.

360
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:30,443
Not everything.

361
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,127
The hoi polloi have bowed to me,

362
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,430
but now the king
must kiss my ring.

363
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,495
Oh, come on.

364
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,359
Man, why don't you just have
Mr. Mercer speak to Big Mike directly?

365
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:44,583
Because Big Mike needs me.
He'll never say kind words about me,

366
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:47,127
because if I were to leave, he has to work,

367
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:50,088
and then he has to start expending
all of his energy on the store.

368
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:54,224
Rather than expending it on your mother.

369
00:21:57,828 --> 00:21:59,617
Okay, okay, hold on a second.
-Yes?

370
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,727
What-what, uh...

371
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:02,791
what do you want me to do?

372
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,821
Use this, and get him to say nice words about me.

373
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,866
When Mr. Mercer hears Michael rave,

374
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:11,299
he will finally release me from Satan's pit,

375
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,370
and it will be your paradise.

376
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:16,701
Here's the thing. Big Mike's never going to
speak to me about another employee, okay.

377
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,089
The man's like a wall of stone when it comes to
breaching Buy More policy.

378
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:22,032
Please. Every man has a weakness to exploit.

379
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,780
Mine is Renaissance fairs.

380
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:26,380
Just soften him up a little bit. Grease his wheels.
-Grease him?

381
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:29,068
What is that Michael just cannot get enough of?

382
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:33,159
What can I do for you, son?

383
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:36,997
Well I had an extra chicken teriyaki footlong
I thought someone would be

384
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,269
interested in?
-Do tell.

385
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,591
Five-dollar footlong.

386
00:22:57,984 --> 00:22:59,077
Oh, boy.

387
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,804
Chicken teriyaki. Yep.

388
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:02,887
A taste of the Orient in Burbank.

389
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:05,351
The flavors melt together in perfect harmony.

390
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:07,106
Just like me and your mama.

391
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:11,764
Can I ask you a question?

392
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,248
What do you think of Emmett?

393
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,293
I really don't think I should talk about
other employees in front of you, Morgan.

394
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:21,112
Well, don't-don't think of me as an employee...

395
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:22,783
Dad.

396
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:24,945
You think of me as

397
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,106
family.

398
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,442
You're right.

399
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:31,532
If you can't trust family...

400
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,712
<i>who can you trust?</i>

401
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:37,680
I guess this is good-bye, huh?

402
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:39,480
Yeah.

403
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,312
Well, thanks for trying.

404
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,448
Ugh. Disgusting.

405
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:03,829
Oh, God.

406
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:08,300
If it's FULCRUM, this could be my last
chance to find out where they put my dad.

407
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:09,569
Don't answer that, Bartowski.

408
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:10,525
Bernie. Talk to me.

409
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:13,496
<i>We're moving Orion. Bill wants all agents
back to base.

410
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,373
They're moving my dad,
and they want all the agents back at the base.

411
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:19,076
Okay, keep him on the line.
We're going to trace his call.

412
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,082
Yeah, yeah, I'll, uh,
I'll be back at the base

413
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:25,211
pronto, but first there's a couple
of things I'd like to discuss.

414
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:27,011
<i>Discuss? Discuss what?

415
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,992
You know, you know, stuff.
Stuff to discuss.

416
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:31,908
particularly my salary.

417
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:32,960
<i>Your salary?

418
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:36,637
I've been burning the midnight oil,
and if you ask me, my work speaks for itself.

419
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:39,701
<i>Bernie, what the hell are you talking about?

420
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:41,340
Also,

421
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:44,037
there are other pertinent things
that we could talk about.

422
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:46,301
Including, but not limited to...

423
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:48,718
the dental plan and vacation days.

424
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:51,612
And I could use a gym membership.
Have you looked at me?

425
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:53,875
Excellent. Good. We'll talk about it at the base. Bye.

426
00:24:54,387 --> 00:24:56,206
Dental plan? Moron.

427
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:59,535
Okay, it looks like the call came
from 1600 Destefano Court.

428
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,626
It's an office building somewhere off Mulholland.

429
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:03,064
I- I know that building.

430
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:06,638
It's the headquarters for the
Strength Leadership Corporation.

431
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,587
They run CEO and management training seminars,

432
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:12,806
but really that's just a front
for a FULCRUM recruiting facility.

433
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:14,632
Why-why would they take my dad there?

434
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,045
Because they have holding cells
for prisoners on the eighth floor.

435
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,916
We better hustle. Let'go.
-Take me with you. I've been there before.

436
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,387
I know my way around the building
and the security system.

437
00:25:23,653 --> 00:25:25,395
Guys, we need her.

438
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:38,885
<i>Chuck, you can't trust anyone.

439
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,098
<i>I know it looks look like a boring office
building, but it's run by FULCRUM.

440
00:25:55,788 --> 00:26:00,227
Casey, she's right, these are not pencil pushers.
These are FULCRUM assassins.

441
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,769
Relax, killer. The going gets rough,
you can always deploy The Morgan.

442
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:09,599
Chuck, we've tapped into the security feed.
I'm watching your every move.

443
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,866
You're going to be safe.

444
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,289
<i>When you get to the desk,

445
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:13,837
tell him you're here for Auditing.

446
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,108
What, is that like accounting?

447
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:16,540
No, it's like testing.

448
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,340
Can I help you, gentlemen?
-Yes, we're here for Auditing.

449
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,347
Second floor. Up the stairs.

450
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:31,734
Okay, now, go past the testing
center down the hallway to the elevator.

451
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,302
The holding cells are on the eighth floor.

452
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:47,373
Okay, make a right
and go down the hallway.

453
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,676
Hey, what are you doing here?

454
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:52,353
Uh, we're, uh...
we're here for the Auditing.

455
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:54,269
Who set the meeting?

456
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,950
Tell him Mr. Dornhoffer.
-Mr. Dornhoffer.

457
00:26:58,337 --> 00:26:59,754
You're on the wrong floor.

458
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:01,115
Oh, we were told eight.
-Eight.

459
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,218
No? Okay.
Sorry about that.

460
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,070
But it's a... it's a common mistake I'm sure.

461
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,913
<i>Chuck, just do what he says.
I'll find another way

462
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:08,542
to get to your dad.

463
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:11,826
You two are late.

464
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:13,077
Sorry.

465
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,374
Before the test, we have a brief video
for you to watch.

466
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:25,742
<i>Welcome to FULCRUM.

467
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:31,019
<i>Solving tomorrow's problems...today.

468
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:33,484
<i>We live in a dangerous world.

469
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:36,367
<i>And you want to do something about it.

470
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:40,296
<i>Do you have what it takes?

471
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,587
<i>We're about to find out.

472
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,057
<i>Good luck on the test, comrades.

473
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,483
<i>You may begin.

474
00:27:47,518 --> 00:27:48,612
What do we do now?

475
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:51,651
You have to take the test, Chuck.
You don't want to raise their suspicions.

476
00:27:53,754 --> 00:27:55,232
<i>To begin test press Start

477
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:56,948
I hate these tests.

478
00:28:07,323 --> 00:28:09,215
I'm not gonna cheat.

479
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,373
You're kidding, right?
-No, I'm not kidding.

480
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,806
Found them on the eighth floor, Mr. Bergey.

481
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:23,221
Said they were lost, were here for Auditing.

482
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:27,387
Well, let's find out who they really are.

483
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,632
<i>System - Facial Recognition...

00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:43,190
I must say, Emmett, I'm impressed.
The store's running smoothly.

488
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:46,611
The employees, for some strange reason,
respect you.

489
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,105
Now if I could only find Big Mike.

490
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,867
Oh, he took the day off.

491
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,519
What? Why would
Michael take the day off?

492
00:28:54,554 --> 00:28:56,915
You're looking at him. Please.

493
00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:59,202
Listen.

494
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:03,031
<i>Emmett's a good worker. Thanks to Emmett,
I can fish three times a week

<i>do a little fishing this afternoon.</i>
-Okay.

497
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:14,102
I came down here to evaluate
Big Mike and he's off fishing?

498
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:17,369
Well, Emmett,

499
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,708
you've been gunning for Mike's job all year.

500
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:22,906
It's yours.

501
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:28,900
Good luck...

502
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,117
...store manager.
-Thank you.

503
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:37,904
<i>Test Complete

504
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,716
Congratulations.
Your test score was very impressive.

505
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:44,348
Bill Bergey, our seminar leader,
would like to meet you.

506
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,606
Bill Bergey's head of recruiting.
He'll know where Chuck's dad is.

507
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:50,388
How did I do?
-I'm sorry, sir. You failed.

508
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:55,334
In fact, I'm afraid you had one of the
lowest scores we've ever had.

509
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:58,208
Come with me, Mr. Carmichael.

510
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,720
you know, what-what my friend lacks in the
intellect department, he does make up for in brawn.

511
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:07,017
Certainly, you must have some kind of a job
moving boxes or heavy equipment?

512
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:09,796
Come with me, Mr. Carmichael.
-Okay.

513
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:13,761
<i>Casey, stand down.</i>
Just let Chuck go.

514
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,588
We can track him using his watch.

515
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:20,349
May I help sir?

516
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:21,649
This way.

517
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:30,089
This way, Agent Casey.

518
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,917
Talk to me, Walker. I'm all clear.
-Okay, Chuck's on the 15th floor.

519
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:46,316
He's heading to the far west side
of the building. It's a secure area.

520
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:48,086
<i>You're going to need a way in.

521
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:54,004
hello, welcome. I'm Bill Bergey.
-Charles Carmichael.

522
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:57,192
Nice to meet you. Please sit down.
-Thank you.

523
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,284
So...

524
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,779
I know who you really are, Charles.

525
00:31:02,814 --> 00:31:05,720
That your father is Orion.

526
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,911
Orion?

527
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:12,651
Uh, I'm not really tracking.
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:16,754
I'm-I'm just here for the... for the seminar.
Leadership first, right?

529
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:20,062
well, then you're out of luck.
The seminar is full.

530
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:23,437
Are you wearing a wire?
-That's preposterous.

531
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:26,688
Are you wearing a wire?
-Yes, yes, I am.

532
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,455
Chuck?

533
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,488
Okay, Casey, they've got him. I'm going in.
-You have to take me with you.

534
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,036
And how do I know I can trust you?
-You don't. But you need my help,

535
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:37,886
and we're the only chance Chuck's got.

536
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,224
You made a big mistake coming here to rescue him.

537
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,745
<i>Intruder alert, 15th floor.</i>
-Sir, we have a break in.

538
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,813
<i>Security breech.

539
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,810
<i>Security breech.

540
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:01,854
<i>Security breech.

541
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,694
<i>Security breech.

542
00:32:06,163 --> 00:32:07,758
<i>Security breech.

543
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:11,001
Watch him.
He tries to escape, shoot him.

544
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:15,559
Guys, look, honestly, I'm not going
to try and escape. Scout's honor.

545
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,242
<i>CIA intrusion- get everyone out.

546
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,155
We're out of here.

547
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:46,649
Looks like I passed that test.
-Where's Sarah?

548
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:52,352
She came to rescue you,
got pinned down by some FULCRUM agents.

549
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,971
Okay... let's go get my dad.
-Your test-taking skills

550
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:59,519
won't do any good out there. Get on the
computer. Find out which room he's in.

551
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:06,002
<i>Please exit in orderly fasion

552
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:09,293
<i>Please exit in orderly fasion

553
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,511
<i>Jill, which office is Chuck in?

554
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,027
Jill?

555
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,788
<i>Casey, Jill escaped.

556
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:24,664
<i>Let's go, let's go.
Destroy the hard drives!

557
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:34,202
Go to cell 11- move Orion to Black Rock.

558
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:38,525
No time to waste- Orion's too valuable.
We'll talk again at Black Rock.

559
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:44,470
Get away from that computer, now!

560
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,779
I just want my father back.
-Good news, bad news, Charles.

561
00:33:47,814 --> 00:33:51,065
The good news is that your father
is too valuable for us to kill.

562
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,871
The bad news?
You're not.

563
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,467
Now, step away from the...

564
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:03,044
What is it with that move?

565
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,695
Help. -Oh, God.
-Help me.

566
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:16,101
<i>Help! Please, please, somebody, I need help!

567
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:19,783
Pull me up!
-I'm trying! I'm trying!

568
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:23,821
Look, please, please, tell me where my father is.
-Or what, you'll drop me?

569
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:27,498
I'd never drop you- that's a horrible thing
to do to somebody.

570
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,244
Really?
-Yeah,

571
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:32,428
it's a 15-story fall. It's an awful way to die.

572
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,744
Pull me up, I'll talk.
-Hold on.

573
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,155
Hold on, Chuck, I got you.

574
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,514
No, he's slipping. Hurry, he's slipping.

575
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:44,260
Hold on.

576
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,019
Oh, God... oh, God.

577
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,202
Thank you.

578
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:59,680
Look, we have to get to my dad now.
-Eighth floor- let's go.

579
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:10,887
That's for flunking me.

580
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,872
Miss me?
-Yeah, immensely. Jill's gone.

581
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:16,742
What happened?

582
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:19,446
Well, he attacked me.
I did The Morgan, and he flew out the window.

583
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:21,456
Two kills in two days, Chuck.

584
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,814
that Morgan move is real killer.

585
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,450
Dad!

586
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:33,725
We're too late.

587
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:38,457
I'm never going to find him, am I?

588
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:41,274
Wait, I overhead them say that
they were moving your father to a place

589
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:44,663
I never heard of, a place called Black Rock.

590
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,405
Oh, my God.
I know where they're taking him.

591
00:35:52,811 --> 00:35:55,147
Black Rock is a code name for Protocol 7,

592
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:57,326
a secret FULCRUM base in Barstow.

593
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:59,136
How do you know that, Chuck?

594
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,226
You don't want to know.

595
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:01,754
Chuck, can you hear me?

596
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,885
<i>I'm on the eighth floor.
They've already evacuated my dad.

597
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:07,045
Okay, hold tight. We're on our way.
-Okay, come on.

598
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,522
What are you doing?
-Don't move.

599
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:19,039
Look, Jill, there was no deal.

600
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:23,111
I lied to you because, at the time, I was willing
to do whatever it took to find my father,

601
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:24,271
but not anymore.

602
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,604
You held up your side of the bargain,
and I'm going to hold up mine.

603
00:36:28,044 --> 00:36:30,470
I told you I wouldn't let them change me, and I won't.

604
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,630
Thank you, Chuck.

605
00:36:32,082 --> 00:36:35,344
Look, you should go before they get here.
-Okay.

606
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:36,846
But, Jill,

607
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,242
look, you're going to be all alone out there.

608
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,787
No friends, no money, nothing.

609
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,995
This is worth a lot.

610
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,755
Casey's probably going to kill me.

611
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:54,426
I always dreamt of giving you a ring, Jill...

612
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:56,421
just not like this.

613
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,943
You're sure you can trust them, right?

614
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:02,554
Go.

615
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:12,218
Welcome back to gen pop, Michael.

616
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,745
Good luck.

617
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:38,502
I know it was you, Morgan.

618
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,510
You broke my heart.

619
00:37:43,926 --> 00:37:46,085
You broke my heart.

620
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:10,016
I don't want anything to happen to him
as long as his mom and I are dating.

621
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:12,512
<i>How could you let
Jill Roberts get away?

622
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:15,837
I'm sorry, General, I took her inside the
building because I didn't have a choice.

623
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:19,506
<i>So, not only do we have no idea where
Steve Bartowski is,

624
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:23,442
<i>we have a FULCRUM agent
who knows all of our secrets running free.

625
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:24,627
<i>Where is Chuck now?

626
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,035
He's on his way to the Buy More.

627
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,480
Permission to drop the twerp into
a deep dark hole, General.

628
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,552
<i>Granted.

629
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:31,164
Huh?
<i>-It's over</i>

630
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:34,142
<i>the Human Intersect project
has become too hard to control.

631
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:35,787
<i>I can't afford to wonder anymore if

632
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:38,470
<i>this team or Chuck Bartowski
is a liability.

633
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,022
What are you saying, General?

634
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,743
<i>I'm Shutting down this project.

635
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:44,077
<i>Chuck's going into lockdown.
He'll be taken to Washington

636
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,518
<i>and put into a secured facility
once and for all.

637
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,151
Operation "Moron" is over?

638
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,735
You are making a mistake, General.

639
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,480
<i>I have made my decision, agent Walker.

640
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,359
Chuck isn't gonna go down
without a fight.

641
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,975
<i>That's why there won't be one.

642
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,530
What do you mean?

643
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:58,849
<i>Chuck trusts you, Sarah.

644
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,982
<i>He believes you would
never betray him. Use that.

645
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:03,497
<i>Go to Chuck.

646
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,850
<i>Tell him that we intercepted his
father while being transported,

647
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,776
<i>And he's back at Castle.

648
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:11,755
Trusted the wrong person, Chuck.

649
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:15,752
<i>Agent Casey will be waiting here.

650
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:18,544
<i>He will trank Chuck.

651
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:23,387
<i>Then he will wait for the
extraction team to arrive for his transfer.

652
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:25,356
<i>That is all.

653
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,864
How can you just stand there
and say nothing?

654
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:44,400
Beckman's right, safest place
for Chuck is underground.

655
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,610
<i>What do you think is gonna
happen when FULCRUM finds Jill anyway?

656
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,684
We have good news.
-Can it wait? Computer emergency.

657
00:39:57,694 --> 00:39:59,221
It's about your father.

658
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:01,475
We found him.

659
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:07,795
What? How? Where is he?

660
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:12,686
One of our recon teams intercepted
his trasport as FULCRUM was moving him.

661
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:15,296
He's back at the castle.
He's safe, Chuck.

662
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,218
It's all over.

663
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,850
I owe you an apology.

664
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:30,083
Why?

665
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,991
I was beginning to think that i couldn't
trust you anymore, Sarah.

666
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:37,463
That maybe Jill was right, that the CIA
was never gonna let me go,

667
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:40,823
That they would always put their
best interest ahead of mine.

668
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:43,366
But not you.

669
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:47,236
You've always looked out for me,
Thank you.

670
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:09,910
Take off your watch.

671
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,839
Why?
-Because it's all a lie.

672
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:18,894
Your dad is still out there, Beckman
sent me to get you to bring you back to the castle.

673
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:20,754
They're gonna take you underground.

674
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,363
We have to run.

675
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:45,796
You're disobeying orders for me?

676
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,201
You're commiting treason, Sarah.
You could go to jail.

677
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,119
I Know.
