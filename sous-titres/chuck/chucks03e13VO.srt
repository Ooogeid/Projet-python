00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,800
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few
things you might need to know.</i>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,000
<i>SARAH:
You're not the same guy
that I fell for.</i>

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
How am I not the same guy?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,100
You killed somebody, Chuck.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,900
He didn't kill the mole.
What?

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,400
<i>I did.
It's time you learned the truth</i>

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,800
about your
wife's murder.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,700
No!

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,100
If the Ring</i>
<i>played him this video...</i>

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,900
Oh, my God, General,
where is Sarah now?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
I believe she's with Agent Shaw.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,100
Daniel, where are
you taking us?

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,500
To settle an old score.

14

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
Okay, just give me 20 seconds.
Are you sure about this?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,500
NSA picked up
the Director's signal.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,100
This is his
broadcast point.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,900
If they're right, Sarah,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the Ring's most senior operative
is behind that door.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,800
Cover me.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey, hey, buddy.
Where's Casey?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Haven't seen him.
I have been thinking

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,700
about this whole unofficial
member of Operation Bartowski

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,000
and I'd like
to make it official.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,100
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of
in the middle of something...
Spyish?

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,600
I know. That's my point,
dude. Let me help.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to be
part of the team.
Okay, fine.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,500
Help me find Casey
and you're part of the team.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,200
Operation Bartowski?
I could actually...

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,700
Not so loud.
Not so loud, right.

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,600
It's just great
news, you know,

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
because, listen, I could be
your second in command
slash personal assistant.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Batman needs Alfred.

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Bond needs Q.

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,300
Chuck-- hey, hey, hey.
You need me.

37
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,600
Morgan, I need Casey right now.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Well, Chuck, per my excellent
peripheral vision--

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
which is a valuable spy skill
I might add--

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I can tell you that
one John Casey is
now exiting the restroom.

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,900
Oh, thank you. Great.
You're welcome.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,200
So I'm a spy?
That's it? Official?

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Yes, you're a spy. Gotta go.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,900
I am a spy.

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Shaw?

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,500
Walker killed Shaw's wife?

47
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,800
It was five years ago.
It was her Red Test.

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Sarah didn't know.
Beckman didn't know, but Shaw,
he knows.

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, he and Sarah have
disappeared on some mission.
They're off the grid.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,800
They can't be raised.
They're gone.
Chuck, I'm not an agent.

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,100
You shouldn't be
telling me any of this.

52
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
But you know what to do, Casey.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Okay, Beckman told me
to just sit tight.

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
You and I know
I can't do that.

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Sarah just activated
her locator.

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
She's in trouble.

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,200
Come on, man!

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
You know how I feel about her.

59
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Call this number.

60
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
Request Tactical Support.

61
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
You'll be forwarded
to a Colonel Sanders.

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Don't make fun of his name.

63
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,700
You want air,
armor-- everything.

64
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,300
...video camera
for your birthday.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,300
I had no idea you were
going to use my present
against me.

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
Happy birthday.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
I love you.

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Oh, my God.

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
I love you.

70
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,000
All right, one more time,
just so we're clear.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
We have to reacquire
Agent Walker.

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Nothing can happen to her.
Do I make myself clear?

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,100
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
This is Team Leader.
Is everything set?

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Air is go.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,900
Mechanized is go.

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
Tactical is go.

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,200
Airborne is go.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
All right, boys,
let's do this.

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,300
Shaw.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,900
I'm going first.

82
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,400
Shaw.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
What is going on?

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,100
What is this?
This is my Red Test.

85
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,900
Why would they have
my surveillance footage
from my first kill?

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,900
Just take a breath.

87
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,000
This is the worst
moment of my life
up there on that monitor.

88
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,000
I love you.

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,900
Mine, too.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,900
What?

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Why? Who is she?

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Evelyn Shaw.

93
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,600
I killed your wife?

94
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,400
?

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,100
You had no idea that
the Ring was behind this.

96
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
Shaw, I killed your wife.

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
This isn't your fault.
I thought I was a good spy.

98
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,400
This isn't your fault.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,900
Hey... it's okay.

100
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Chuck?

101
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,700
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

102
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,800
Move! Move! Move!

103
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
The perimeter's surrounded.
Put your hands up!

104
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Down on the ground now!

105
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,000
Now! Now!

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,200
?

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
MAN (over radio):
What's happening in there?

108
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,200
Target's secure?

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,700
This is Team Leader.

110
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Cancel air support.

111
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Cancel tactical.

112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
And the tank, the tank!

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Cancel the tank.

Chuck vs. The Other Guy
Enjoy!

116
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,900
Who on Earth gave you
the authority to call in a full tactical assault?

117
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know what
to do with you,

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,700
but I know you're not ready.

119
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,000
But, General, it was Sarah.

120
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
Come on. I had to...

121
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,600
You want to see the bill
for your rescue mission?

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
<i>It's longer than
my copy of Atlas Shrugged.</i>

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Look, you and I both
thought the worst.

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
That Shaw had gone rogue.

125
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
That he was going to...
Kill Sarah?

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Shaw.

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Sarah.

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Listen...

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,100
You thought
I betrayed my country?

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,200
General, Chuck's actions
were those of a true spy.

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,500
He was looking out
for his partner
and the Agency.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,300
I would have done
the same myself.

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,900
Maybe without
the stealth bombers,

134
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,500
but perhaps
that's just me.

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you doing okay?

136
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,200
Thank you for saving me.

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,300
I appreciated the tank.

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
General,
did you check
Sarah's records?

140
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Any clues as to who
ordered her Red Test?

141
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm afraid, Sarah,
Langston Graham took
that secret to his grave.

142
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,800
Well, okay, General, then what
are we supposed to do now?

143
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
We disband the team.

144
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,400
Surely, you can't operate
as an effective
unit with this history.

145
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,500
General, if I may?

146
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,600
This isn't the first
time they've used
one of our own

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,100
I want to make sure
it's the last.

148
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,600
You're saying you can
still work with Walker?

149
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,400
I can.

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
We both want
the same thing:

151
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,200
to capture
the Director
and take down the Ring.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you with me?

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,100
Can we still be a team?

154
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,700
Yes.

155
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Great.

156
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,400
Everyone's back together again.

157
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
What is it, boy?

158
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
My demo station
don't cook by itself.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,900
I, uh...

160
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,100
Spit it out, son.

161
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Is it your mama?

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's Chuck. Is he okay?

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,300
Jeff and Lester,
I could give

164
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,600
a damn about them.
Go ahead and fire them.

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,600
It's okay.

166
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Someone else?

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
Who's the issue?
Me.

168
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,700
Me. I'm the issue.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,100
This is tough.

170
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
I'm quitting.

171
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,600
I found a job.

172
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,500
A real job.

173
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,000
You can feel proud about it?

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,300
You're not selling your body?

175
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,600
You've got to go.

176
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,700
Boy...

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
I... I can't show emotions
like this.

178
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Those animals
out there, they'll...

179
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,000
They'll get me if I do.

180
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,100
I think Morgan's dying.

181
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,800
I call dibs on his locker.

182
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,700
Its location is far more
prestigious than my own.

183
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,800
No, man. Those are
tears of joy.

184
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Morgan's leaving.
Grimes.

185
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,900
Don't worry, John.

186
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,700
You will always have us.

187
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,000
And now,
sans Morgan,

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,100
we have room!

189
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
For what?

190
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,200
For you.
In our crew, buddy.

191
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
Come on. Hands in!

192
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,300
You, you can let go
of my hand now.

193
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
What is it, Bartowski?

194
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
General, if I could
speak freely?

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
<i>That's not a good idea.</i>

196
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,900
As the titular member
of Team Bartowski,

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
I think that it's crazy
to be putting Shaw
back in the field so soon.

198
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,400
He just found out that
Sarah killed his wife, okay?

199
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
The guy's got to be an emotional
train wreck right now.

200
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,400
Nobody can control
their feelings that well.

201
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Chuck, what you are
seeing in Shaw
is an absolute professional:

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,500
something you are not.

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
That's why I'm moving them
out of Burbank.

204
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,200
Moving who out of Burbank?

205
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,500
Sarah and Shaw.

206
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm proceeding
with my original plan.

207
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,800
They'll head up our Ring
task force in Washington.

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,900
And what about me?

209
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,700
You'll stay in Burbank until
I know what to do with you.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Wa-pshh!

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,100
Where you going, sport?

212
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,000
New job?

213
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,200
It's kind of secret.

214
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
You're going to work for Chuck.

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,900
I'm not a moron.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,800
All right.

217
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,300
Isn't it awesome?
Can you believe it?

218
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,600
Me, a spy.

219
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,900
And listen,

220
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,300
when-when General Beckman
lets you come back,

221
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
me and you will be
spies together.

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,200
Beckman doesn't forget
a small thing like "treason."

223
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
And, uh...

224
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm really learning
to enjoy my new life here.

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,900
Are you kidding me?

226
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,500
John, your old life
was so exciting.

227
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
The adventures, the missions,
the weaponry,
the women...

228
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Please stop.

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,900
Right. Got it.

230
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,000
Learn to
lock it down.

231
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,800
Well, I'll
tell you what.

232
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm glad you're
okay here, you know?

233
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Won't be the same
without you.

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,800
But, uh...

235
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,400
enjoy my old life.

236
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
You, too.

237
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,300
Got some very exciting news.

238
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,400
Are you ready?
Hold onto your hat.

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I did it. I...

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,100
What the heck is
going on here?

241
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,200
Are you mixing
gaming with whiskey?

242
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,900
She's leaving, man.

243
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,500
Leaving with the other guy.

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,300
No, this cannot happen.

245
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
This cannot happen.

246
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,300
I thought I stood a chance,
you know?

247
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,700
Yeah, well,
just...

248
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Okay, okay, buddy.

249
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
Hand it over.
Hmm-mm, hmm-mm. No.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Let go.
No.

251
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,100
You are on the precipice
of emotional ruin here.

252
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,700
I'm already over the edge!
No, you're not!

253
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,600
Soon you're gonna start
quoting liberally
from the works

254
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
And then things
are gonna go dark.

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,300
Things are gonna
go really dark,

256
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
and I'm not gonna
let that happen.

257
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Morgan, hand over the bottle!

258
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,300
Never!

259
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Yes, you will.

260
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Make me.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,100
I hope you're happy.

262
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,200
She said she couldn't
be with someone
who didn't believe in her.

263
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,600
Well, I believed in her.

264
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,700
I just didn't believe in me.

265
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Dude, you are misquoting
the line,

266
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>and you are ruining
Pretty in Pink for me.</i>

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,800
Now, just stop it.

268
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,300
Put the cap back on
the top of the bottle,

269
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,400
and let's forget that this
night ever happened. Okay?

270
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm really good at that, dude.

271
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
I've forgotten
entire years, man.

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,100
What is happening?

273
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Hey, Sarah.

274
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,700
Chuck's in a,
a bit of a low spot.

275
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,900
Yeah, yeah,

276
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
I see that.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
He found out that
you're leaving with Shaw.

278
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,300
He's also eaten an entire carton
of sugar-free mint ice cream,

279
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,100
which is only concerning,
well, when you factor in
the large consumption

280
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,300
Thank you.

281
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,100
Morgan, can you
leave us please?

282
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I forgive you.

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,700
Great, now I
hate this song.

284
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
Look, I, uh...

285
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I know what I look like.

286
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
The mint ice cream
sobered me up pretty good.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,800
Chuck, it's okay.

288
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,900
No, it isn't.

289
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,400
I thought I could save you.

290
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,600
I thought Shaw was bad
and I was gonna save you,

291
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,100
and we were gonna
be together.

292
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
But that didn't happen.

293
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,800
Shaw's a good spy.

294
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,500
I get it, okay?

295
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,200
I think everybody gets it.

296
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,000
Shaw is amazing.

297
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,200
And you two are gonna go run off
together and save the world.

298
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,500
And that's great news
for the world.

299
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,400
But earlier on
in my...

300
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,900
drunken haze...

301
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
I realized that I hadn't
asked you a question.

302
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,800
Really important
question
that I'd like to ask you

303
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,000
Just once,
for the record...

304
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,700
Sarah, do you love me?

305
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,200
Wow. I'm, uh,

306
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,400
I'm in my underwear.

307
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm sitting in my underwear,
holding a plastic guitar.

308
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,500
There's a very good chance
I'm making a complete fool
of myself, isn't there?

309
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Yes.

310
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,800
I should probably
put some pants on.

311
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,700
No, Chuck.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes.

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Wh... uh, what?

314
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,700
Chuck, I fell
for you a long,
long time ago--

315
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
after you fixed my phone

316
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,800
and before you started defusing
bombs with computer viruses.

317
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,600
So, yes.

318
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,300
Yes.

319
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,100
Wait, wait.

320
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
What about my Red Test?

321
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,900
Casey told me.

322
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,800
He told me that
he killed the mole

323
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,600
and that
you couldn't do it.

324
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,300
And it was the best news
that I'd ever heard

325
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,000
because it means
that you haven't changed.

326
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're still Chuck.

327
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,900
You're still my Chuck.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I, uh, I will be
totally cleaned up
by tomorrow.

329
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,600
Well, you don't have time
because we have a mission.

330
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,400
Shaw found the
Ring headquarters.

331
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,500
It's a three-man op,
and you're our third.

332
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
Mission?

333
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,000
No problem.

334
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,600
Morgan, what are you doing?

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
Right. Where are my manners?

336
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,200
We haven't even met
professionally.

337
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Morgan Grimes.

338
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,300
Agent of the CIA
and an assistant to one
Charles Irving Bartowski.

339
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
Now, let's get to work here.

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,800
You heard the lady.

341
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
There is a mission,

342
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
and you are needed.

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's get you some coffee.

344
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,500
You okay, Chuck?

345
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,100
Huh, what, me? Yeah,
good. Totally cool.

346
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah, ready to go.

347
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,900
Everything is
totally normal.

348
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,600
All right.

349
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,100
Director has his own
private elevator.

350
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,700
You two are gonna
rappel down to it.

351
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
When the
Director leaves,
grab him; I'll pull you back up.

352
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,300
Cool.

353
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,100
Great.

354
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,300
You think he
knows about us?

355
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm just saying...

356
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
Okay, ready?

357
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Don't worry about the warehouse
or Beckman, Chuck.

358
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,900
I trust you completely.

359
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,700
Yeah.

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Okay, Shaw, we're in.

361
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,000
What's the matter?

362
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,900
Um, I have a concern about Shaw.

363
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,100
While he, yes, is a very
great spy, emotionally,

364
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,600
the guy is Swiss
cheese, okay?

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,100
Chuck, Shaw is one step closer
to capturing the Director.

366
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
And I'm sure that is all
he is thinking about,
so don't even worry.

367
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
All right, Sarah, I'm accessing
the elevator's controls.

368
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
What is it?
Someone heard something...

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,800
Gentlemen.

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
See! See! He knows!

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Shaw, are you okay?

372
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,400
He's having a mental break.
We're fish in a barrel.

373
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,400
Sorry about that, guys.

374
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
Little Ring company.

375
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
See, I told you he wasn't
trying to kill us.

376
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,900
All right.

377
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
I'm opening the hatch.

378
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,900
Oh, don't worry.
It's a tranq gun.

379
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,800
Okay, fine. Just
sell that it's real.

380
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Right, of course.
Ruthless spy.

381
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,900
You're gonna take care of
most of them though, right?

382
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Sarah, internal security system
is detecting something moving
toward the elevator.

383
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,800
Looks like the Director's
coming in early.

384
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,400
Time to meet
our bad guy.

385
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,300
One word and you're dead.

386
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,900
Now, this is brazen.

387
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,400
That... that was four words.

388
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,100
Kidnapping me in my own lift.

389
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,300
Impressive.

390
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,000
But there's absolutely no chance
you'll get the Cipher.

391
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,600
Did he just say Cipher?

392
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Yeah.

393
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
What do you mean?
Don't play dumb.

394
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
You're better than that.

395
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
We've been building
our own Intersect for a year.

396
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,700
You know that.

397
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,900
Of course. The Cipher is
the Intersect's core processor.

398
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Fine, so it's here.
So where exactly is it?

399
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,000
You won't get five feet
from this door.

400
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
My security will be
on you in seconds.

401
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
Well, that's tough because
either we get the Cipher or...

402
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,500
Pull out your Ring phone.

403
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,200
What Ring phone?

404
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,900
You mean, this Ring phone?

405
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Yeah, that Ring phone
right there.

406
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,000
Call your assistant.

407
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
What?
You know, your secretary.

408
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,900
Whoever you have.
Call him or her,

409
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,400
have them bring
the Cipher to you here.

410
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
And put it on speakerphone.

411
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,900
You give her one warning,
and I'm gonna...

412
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,700
Please.
I know the drill.

413
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
Denise.

414
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,900
Sir, you asked for this.

415
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,600
Also, I spoke
with Operative 6.

416
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,100
They'll proceed with the coup
in 15 minutes.

417
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,400
The Spanish Ambassador
also called back
with the ransom offer.

418
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,700
He wants to close
by end of day tomorrow
at the latest.

419
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,000
Thank you, Denise.

420
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,500
And please text me
when the plane lands
in Barcelona.

421
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,700
"Barcelona"-- it's a code.

422
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,200
Oh, "Barcelona's" a code?
That-that's good.

423
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
What are we supposed
to do with her now?!

424
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,900
Well, personally,
I'd shoot her.

425
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,100
Decisions, decisions.

426
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,000
Shaw, what's going on?

427
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,300
Just need a few more seconds.
Well, we don't have seconds.

428
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,100
Sorry, sir.

429
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,000
One of our guys heard
something strange
in the elevator shaft.

430
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Hi, welcome to the party.

431
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,800
This is getting ridiculous.

432
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
I've got it. Here we go.

433
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,900
You know it's over, right?

434
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,000
What?

435
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,800
This was a trap.

436
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
For you.

437
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Okay, nobody move.

438
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
We can all die here today.

439
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
<i>You can all die here today.</i>

440
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,300
Personally,
I have dinner reservations.

441
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,300
Look at me.

442
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
Do I look like an amateur?

443
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,800
No, you don't,
but your partner here
is a very different story.

444
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,900
Not much of a spy, are you?

445
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,900
<i>I am a spy.</i>

446
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
Really?

447
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,600
With a tranq pistol?

448
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
Real gun too dangerous
for you?

449
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,700
Put it down.

450
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,100
Sorry, Chuck.

451
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,800
Daniel...

452
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,900
still upset about your wife?

453
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
You should
really learn to get
over that or take it out

454
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,800
She pulled
the trigger.

455
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Go. Take the service elevator
to the fifth floor,

456
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,500
then the north
stairwell.

457
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,500
I'll get the Cipher.

458
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
I'll meet you back at Castle.

459
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,900
Shaw, we're not gonna
leave you here.

460
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,500
Sarah, go, please.

461
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,900
Did he...?

462
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,900
You know, I think
you're right.

463
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,500
I think we should
probably wait
to tell him about us.

464
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,200
Good work, Daniel.

465
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,500
I think they bought it.

466
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,700
?

467
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,500
You weren't supposed
to eliminate the Director, Shaw.

468
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,900
This wasn't a red op.

469
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,500
I did what I had to
to get my team out.

470
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh! That was a huge kick!
Where did we...?

471
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
Where'd you get this?
Where'd we get this footage?

472
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,900
I tapped into the building
security feed during the op.

473
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,800
Wow, that's a hell
of a roundhouse, buddy.

474
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,400
Uh, General, I do think
it's worth noting
that we would all be dead

475
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Very well.

476
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,100
General, there's also
the issue of the Cipher.

477
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,700
The Director said
that the Ring was making
a new Intersect.

478
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Relax. My team analyzed
their Cipher

479
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
and found a number of problems
in the design.

480
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
Obviously, the Ring isn't as far
along as they thought.

481
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,100
Looks like the Cipher's
components
were fabricated in France.

482
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,000
That's right, Shaw.

483
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
I need you and Sarah to follow
this trail to Paris.

484
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,900
We believe the Ring's design
facility is there.

485
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,400
We can be in the air
in 30 minutes.

486
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Excuse me, General.

487
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,900
Uh, what, what about me?

488
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Sorry, Chuck, you're not ready.

489
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,200
We are never gonna get
our chance, are we?

490
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,000
Once I get back,
it's all gonna happen...

491
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
you and me.

492
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,300
Don't worry.

493
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Just one more mission.

494
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,100
<i>Hey, look at you!</i>

495
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,000
Nice! I take it
you and Sarah
are official.

496
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Now, the other guy,
he's out of the way?

497
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,600
Well, actually, Sarah and Shaw
are on their way to Paris.

498
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Beckman doesn't think
I'm ready to be out
in the field.

499
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,700
But other than that,
everything's fine.

500
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
How is everything fine?

501
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,900
Chuck, I quit my job
<i>so I could join you
in the field.</i>

502
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,000
You did... you did what?!

503
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,300
You said I was a part your team.

504
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,300
That you were gonna speak
to Beckman about me.

505
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,400
Did you speak
to Beckman about me?

506
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,300
Of course you didn't.
No, why would you?

507
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,800
I'm not a spy.
I'm an idiot.

508
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,700
No, no, you're not an idiot.

509
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,900
I gave up a management position
in a down economy.

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Look, I'm sorry, buddy, okay?
I'm gonna talk to Beckman.

511
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Sarah's gonna come back
into town, and I will prove
that we are

512
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,300
Chuck, are you kidding me?
None of that is gonna happen.

513
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,100
Listen to me.
Shaw's gonna get Sarah, okay?

514
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,400
And you're gonna go willy-nilly,
tie me up again

515
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,100
<i>and drink yourself
into Guitar Hero oblivion.</i>

516
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,200
I may have said
some unfortunate
things about Shaw,

517
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,700
but the fact of
the matter is
the guy's exactly what

518
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,100
That's nice. Good for him.

519
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,700
Know what else he is, dude?
A stud, okay?

520
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,400
And 99 times out of ten,
that guy gets the girl.

521
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,200
We're done here!

522
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,600
Buddy, Morgan, Morgan,

523
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
look, I'm not supposed
to show you this,

524
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,700
but it was so awesome,
I made a copy of it.

525
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,500
It'll help prove my point.
Here we go.

526
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,800
Okay, this is
from the mission.

527
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,300
That is Shaw saving
our butts right there.

528
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
Wait for it.
Wait for the roundhouse.

529
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,400
That's gotta hurt.

530
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,700
We have a problem.

531
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
What?

532
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Chuck, look at this.

533
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,200
He pulls that punch.

534
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,200
And that roundhouse?

535
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,700
It doesn't even land.

536
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,000
But he shot people, Morgan!
Bad people!

537
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,100
Did you see blood,
viscera, brain matter?

538
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,600
Chuck, did you see
brain matter?

539
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
Okay, listen to me.

540
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
I have seen
every Hong Kong
fight film

541
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
ever made, all right?

542
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,100
I direct your attention
to my favorite
Sonny Chiba poster.

543
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,200
I am the man
when it comes to this.

544
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,000
You have to trust me.

545
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,300
I can spot a fake action
sequence from a mile away.

546
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
That's what we have here.

547
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
But if the fight was staged,
that means that Shaw is working
with the Ring.

548
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
And Sarah is with him.

549
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I'm uploading the fight footage
to Beckman's home computer now.

550
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,200
Report, Chuck.

551
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,100
Uh, General, I'm so sorry
about the hour,

552
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,200
but we just figured
something out.

553
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,300
Something very important.

554
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,000
<i>Agent Shaw is working
with the Ring.</i>

555
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,800
Chuck, how many times
do we have to do this?

556
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
General, before, I was right
for the wrong reasons,

557
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,700
but this time
I'm right
for the right reasons,

558
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,800
and-and I have proof.

559
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
Hi, there.

560
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,600
<i>What is he doing here?!</i>

561
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,900
Well, uh, first of all, sir,
uh, ma'am...

562
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,100
Is it "sir"?
What am I doing?

563
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,700
Just talk!
Okay. I'd like to thank you
for this opportunity.

564
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,500
Stop! What are you doing there?!

565
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,700
Me? I'm with him.

566
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
I'm on Chuck's team.

567
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,300
Oh, no. No, you're not
because Chuck's not on
his own team anymore.

568
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,200
I want you both out
of Castle in five minutes!

569
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Chuck, you are suspended!

570
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
No! No, no, General!

571
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,500
Come on!
She's blocking my call.

572
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,900
Well, okay, my time as a spy
was pretty exciting.

573
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,200
A bit brief,
you know?

574
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,400
You're still a spy.

575
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,300
How's that, dude?

576
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,900
Because right now I need a team,
and you're all
I've got, buddy, okay?

577
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,500
CIA or no CIA.

578
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,300
We need to save Sarah.

579
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Just the two of us.

580
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,200
No, there is another.

581
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,400
So now they're in Paris,
Sarah and Shaw.

582
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,100
And Shaw, this time
for real, he is working
for the Ring.

583
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,600
Now, I know that you
can't help me again.
I know all that.

584
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
But Sarah's gonna die
without us.

585
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,700
I can't do this alone.

586
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,900
And I can't help you anymore.
I'm not a spy.

587
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
<i>But you are a spy!
You're the ultimate spy!</i>

588
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,000
<i>Was, Chuck, was.</i>

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,500
But the man's
been Buy More'd.

590
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,000
That's right.

591
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,500
You deluded yourself
into thinking that
Buy More's your life.

592
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,200
But wake up, John, okay?

593
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,700
'Cause we need you
to get on this plane!

594
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,400
Chuck needs you to get
on this plane.

595
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,700
And if not,
that's cool, you know, find
yourself one Friday night

596
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,600
in Jeff and
Lester's crew
hanging out in Woodland Hills.

597
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,100
<i>I know this
because I was that guy.</i>

598
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,900
But Chuck and Sarah
and you, Casey,

599
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
you showed me that
I could be so much more,

600
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,100
that I'm meant
for something:
to be a spy.

601
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,000
What about you?

602
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,600
What do you have left
in the tank?

603
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

604
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Morgan, go to my closet
and get me my suit.

605
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,100
The black one.

606
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,200
Is this all of it?

607
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,500
This is everything
I could find on Shaw.

608
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
I can't believe
this is happening.

609
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,800
She could be dead, Casey.

610
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
Focus on the mission,
will ya?

611
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,800
What is it? You just flashed.

612
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,100
It's a mission
from ten years ago.

613
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,200
It has nothing
to do with Sarah.

614
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,500
I could flash on
everything in here,

615
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,200
and we'd still be at square one
and have nothing.

616
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,900
I'm stuck in the air right now
and there's nothing
I can do about it!

617
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
Chuck, focus.

618
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,500
Forget about
the Intersect.

619
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,700
Forget about
being a spy.

620
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Before all of that,
you were smart.

621
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Now we're gonna take
this intel,

622
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,900
you're gonna figure out
where Sarah is.

623
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
It's what you have to do.

624
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,100
Where are you, Sarah?

625
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,500
Something is off.

626
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,300
What is it?

627
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Why did you bring me here?

628
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
What do you mean?

629
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,300
You led me here.

630
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,300
Come on.
This is where I shot her.

631
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,600
Is this some kind
of a trap?

632
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,100
Sarah... you killed my wife.

633
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,800
Did you really think
that I'd be okay with that?

634
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,000
But you said that...

635
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,600
I told you a lot of things
to get you here.

636
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,200
The gun's getting heavy,
isn't it?

637
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,300
You know, you could hurt someone
with this.

638
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,500
There's a little cafe
around the corner.

639
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Let's sit down,
discuss the details.

640
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,700
Just relax.
It's all over now.

641
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,600
The drug is
a special toxin.

642
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
It won't kill you.

643
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,100
It simply immobilizes
your nervous system.

644
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,000
I want you to see
what's gonna happen next.

645
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
I need you to understand
why I'm doing this.

646
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,600
So, Sarah, I see you've met
my newest Ring agent.

647
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,300
Why?

648
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
Well, I offered Daniel
the chanceto not only avenge
his wife's death,

649
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,300
but to destroy
the very institution
that ordered her murder:

650
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,300
The CIA 

651
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,300
The CIA believed that
Eve had been turned by us.

652
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,900
Your boss Langston Graham
assigned you to kill her.

653
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
You did what
you were told.

654
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,100
I'm going to send a message
to the CIA
that they betrayed

655
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,600
DIRECTOR:
Very well put,
Daniel.

656
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
They need to know
what they did to me.

657
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
They need to feel
the pain that I felt.

658
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,500
And that... is why
I have to kill you.

659
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,900
On that note,
do you have it with you?

660
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,600
The report details the problems
with your Cipher.

661
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,500
The technical data
should help your scientists
complete the new Intersect.

662
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,300
DIRECTOR:
Thank you, Daniel.

663
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,600
We'll be in touch.

664
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,100
Do you need us to, uh...?
No.

665
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,300
I want to show her
the river.

666
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,200
It's...

667
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,000
beautiful at night.

668
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,000
Well, good
night, then.

669
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Good-bye, Sarah.

670
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Almost time to go.

671
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,900
How'd you find me?

672
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,600
I've read your file...

673
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
your wife's, every
mission you've been on,

674
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,700
every paper you
wrote at West Point,

675
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
every travel report.

676
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,900
You come here once a year
in memory of your wife's death.

677
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,500
It made morbid sense
that you'd want Sarah
to see it, too.

678
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,700
Smart. Very smart.

679
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
CHUCK:
You're under arrest.

680
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,900
Now, stand up.

681
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
Less smart, Chuck.

682
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,100
You should pull
the trigger. Now.

683
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,500
Kill me.

684
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I wouldn't do that.

685
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,600
I see you brought Casey.

686
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Oh, yes, I did...

687
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,700
and he's currently taking care
of your new Director.

688
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,100
And you've got me?

689
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,500
Stand... up.

690
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
I guess the gun
was his idea.

691
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Good.

692
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,500
No, Shaw, don't do this.

693
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,000
You can't flash,
can you?

694
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,900
Those emotions get you
into trouble.

695
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Now, you just stay here.

696
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I don't want to hurt you.

697
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,900
None of this
was your fault.

698
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,200
I haven't told them
your secret.

699
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,100
But if you follow me...

700
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,300
I will kill you.

701
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,200
Sarah!

702
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,900
The drug will
dull the pain.

703
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,500
You won't feel a thing.

704
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,700
Stop!

705
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,900
I warned you.

706
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Please...

707
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
it doesn't have to be like this.

708
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,800
This isn't you, Shaw.

709
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
You can't do this.

710
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Happy birthday.

711
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,700
I love you.

712
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,800
<i>No, Chuck, I can.</i>

713
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,500
<i>You can't.</i>

714
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,100
Sarah!

715
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,800
Sarah... Sarah...

716
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,300
Sarah...

717
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,500
We've been over this.

718
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,400
You no longer work for me, John.

719
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,600
Unless there's a sale
at the Buy More,

720
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,200
we have nothing to talk about.

721
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,700
Mm. Then I guess you
don't want to talk about...

722
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,300
my little friend
here, hmm?

723
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,700
The Ring Director.

724
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
What do you want for him?

725
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,400
Well... full reinstatement,
my old rank back,

726
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,000
and a new Crown Victoria...

727
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
And a request you're
probably not gonna like.

728
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,000
It-it seemed like a good job,

729
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
but I just...
couldn't cut it.

730
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,000
What I came here
to ask of you is...

731
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,400
can I come back
to the store, sir?

732
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,700
Uh... maybe?

733
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,400
Just...

734
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,100
I'll see my way out.

735
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,000
Not yet.

736
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,000
I couldn't bear to put
the offer out there.

737
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,900
It's been here waiting for you.

738
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Don't worry, son.

739
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,800
You can always come home.

740
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,700
Thanks a lot, Big Mike.
Dad.

741
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,900
(chuckles):
Yeah.

742
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,800
Thanks, Big Mike.

743
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
Papi.
Let's go with "Dad."
Thanks, Dad.

744
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,200
I like that one.

745
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,400
BECKMAN:
Is this Morgan Grimes?

746
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,500
Yeah. Who dis?

747
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,700
This is General Beckman
of the NSA.

748
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,300
I am calling to say...

749
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,400
that you are officially a member
of Operation Bartowski.

750
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
You're not kidding me, are you?

751
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,200
This isn't some sort of...
mean prank or anything, is it?

752
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
No. We don't do pranks.

753
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,100
You can thank Colonel Casey.

754
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,200
Okay, I got to go quit my job.

755
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,600
Hold on a second.
Don't do that.

756
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,900
Your cover is the Buy More.

757
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,900
Right. Right, that's perfect.

758
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
That's perfect.
I'm good at that.

759
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Aye, aye, Captain.

760
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,900
General.

761
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,300
It's General.

762
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,700
Of course. General. General.

763
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,200
Thank you... thank you, sir.

764
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,300
Ma'am.

765
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,400
I will not let you down.

766
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Are you... Hello?

767
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Hello?

768
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,800
Hey.

769
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,800
How you feeling?

770
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,300
Oh, what happened?

771
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,900
Everything's okay now.

772
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,300
What about Shaw?

773
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,500
He's dead.

774
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,400
I'm sorry.

775
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Oh, my God, we...

776
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,900
there was a...

777
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,200
there was a cafe and...

778
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,300
and a bridge, and he
tried to kill me, and...

779
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,500
Oh, my God, you shot him.

780
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,100
I couldn't let him
hurt you, Sarah.

781
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,300
Trust me, I did
what I had to do.

782
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,200
But I'm still the same guy.
I'm still Chuck.

783
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
I promise.

784
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,400
You saved me.

785
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,400
Chuck, Sarah,
excellent work.

786
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
I've consulted
with Colonel Casey,

787
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,000
and he brought me up to speed.

788
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,500
I'll expect a full report
when you get back to Burbank.

789
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,600
Actually, General,
I think we're gonna need
a few more days

790
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,200
No, I want you back ASAP.

791
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,300
We have a new mission.

792
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,100
Last night a team of Peruvian
assassins broke into...

793
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,600
Agent Bartowski?

794
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Agent Walker?

795
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,700
I've lost contact.
Get them back.

796
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,600
I don't...

797
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,000
Then shut up
and kiss me.
