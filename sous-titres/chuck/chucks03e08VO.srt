1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,302
Hi, i'm Chuck, here's a few things
you might need to know. Who is that?

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:04,736
Super-hot blonde, heart of ice,

3
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:06,204
yeah, it's Chuck's ex, Sarah.

4
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:07,372
What's their deal?

5
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,273
Turns out I haven't been
completely honest.

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:12,827
The truth is, I was
hitting on you.

7
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:14,191
<i>It was completely
unprofessional,</i>

8
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:16,092
<i>and I apologize.</i>

9
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:18,111
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,299
Chuck has a secret girlfriend.

11
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,939
I can't believe that Chuck
is sneaking around

12
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:32,744
my back like this,
living this other life

13
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:35,057
that he doesn't think
I know anything about.

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,566
I guess he'll tell you about
Hannah when he's ready, hon.

15
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:41,249
Hannah- you've said it a
hundred times before so casual.

16
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:43,957
Hannah. Chuck had asked
me to keep it a secret.

17
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,296
You know, maybe it's me.

18
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:46,700
Maybe he thinks, like,

19
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,140
I'll judge him
or something.

20
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:50,481
I mean, he told me about the
first girl he had a crush on-

21
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:51,618
Mrs. Seaver.

22
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,621
Who?

23
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>The mom from Growing Pains.</i>

24
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:56,500
And-and you,
you used to tell me

25
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,372
everything, too,
and now you and my brother

26
00:00:58,373 --> 00:00:59,842
are as thick as thieves.

27
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:01,513
Is there something you're
keeping from me, too?

28
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:03,352
Any secrets?
No, nothing, not a thing.

29
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:04,722
You're lying.

30
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,626
I'm not lying.

31
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:07,828
Your pulse is racing.

32
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:08,931
I'm exercising.

33
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:10,101
Honey, go to Chuck.

34
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:12,274
Tell him how feel. Be honest.

35
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:14,481
That's good advice, honey.

36
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,646
I love you.

37
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:21,687
<i>Chuck?</i>

38
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:24,861
Chuck?

39
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,404
Chuck, listen, uh,

40
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:28,739
I get it.

41
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,478
You know, I'm not the one
that you...

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,416
share everything with anymore.

43
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:37,658
I just- I just miss
being that person.

44
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:40,062
Everybody knew about this
new girl that you're dating

45
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:43,135
before I did.

46
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,738
I just wanted to let you know

47
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,639
that I'm a really good
secret keeper.

48
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:50,615
And if you don't want Sarah
to know about the new girl...

49
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:52,919
I won't tell Sarah if you don't.

50
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,723
Um, I'm Hannah.

51
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:00,433
Oh, my God, this is
so embarrassing. No.

52
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:13,989
Ellie... uh... my sister.

53
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:17,262
I've been meaning
to introduce you to...

54
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,732
...Hannah. Hannah-

55
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,870
who apparently you've already
just met right now. Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:24,673
Hannah is...

57
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:26,242
a girl.

58
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:27,244
She's a girl...

59
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:28,245
and a friend.

60
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,814
A very close friend.

61
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,151
Technically as close as two
people can kind of... Okay.

62
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,455
Doughnut?
No, thanks.

63
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:38,026
Um, I need to go and get dressed
so I can go to work.

64
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:41,331
It was, uh... it was really
great to meet you, Ellie.

65
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,800
Likewise.

66
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:45,170
Okay. Bye. Bye.

67
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,244
I am- I am so sorry.

68
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:51,513
I just... I don't know,

69
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,382
I felt like I was
out of the loop,

70
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,252
and you used to tell
me everything, and...

71
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:57,153
I know. I'm sorry. You
shouldn't be sorry, I'm sorry.

72
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:58,557
I wanted to tell you.

73
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:01,227
I've just been really
wrapped up at work, and...

74
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:03,130
But I have an idea.

75
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:06,635
I'm going to make dinner
for the four of us tonight.

76
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:08,638
And guess what, it's
going to be your favorite.

77
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:09,939
Oh, yeah.

78
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,877
My famous chicken pepperoni.

79
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:15,447
Huh? Oh, I got to
tell you the truth.

80
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:18,985
I love...,

81
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:20,320
your chicken pepperoni.

82
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,690
Yes, I know this.

83
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:24,058
Really, I'm just-

84
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,959
I'm so glad that you're
moving on from Sarah.

85
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:34,072
I thought
you didn't want dessert.

86
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:36,476
I don't.

87
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:37,844
I want yours.

88
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:41,349
See, my dessert is contained
within your dessert.

89
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,118
Listen, Shaw...

90
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,687
I like that.

91
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:47,523
Keep it a last-name
basis. Impersonal.

92
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,225
Very sexy, Walker.

93
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:52,362
I don't think we should see each
other in a non-work capacity.

94
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,330
Oh, is that what this is?

95
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,009
Look, I-it's just,
it's becoming

96
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,079
a pattern for me to get involved
with the guys that I work with,

97
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:09,083
and I really need to put a stop
to that before it starts.

98
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,751
So, this is a
preemptive breakup?

99
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,286
I need to stop mixing
my personal life

100
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:16,253
with my professional life.

101
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:23,226
I'd be a liar if I didn't say
I was disappointed,

102
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,260
but I get it.

103
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,399
The vehicle in question
has arrived.

104
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:32,366
Roger that.

105
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,279
The man is on the move.

106
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,314
I have the target in sight.

107
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,522
Did you wear cologne
in my car?

108
00:04:57,523 --> 00:05:01,058
Nobody wants to smell you.

109
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,360
The next time you wear
cologne in my car,

110
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,328
I will end you.

111
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,131
Night-night.

112
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:22,345
Rafe Gruber is a martial arts
expert, a sharpshooter.

113
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,947
He is one of five people
who can hit a target

114
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,482
from half a mile away.

115
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,116
I mean, the man
is a chameleon.

116
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:31,019
It is a miracle we even
got a hit on his location.

117
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,854
Very few people have
seen his face.

118
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:34,355
Big deal, not impressed.

119
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:36,256
Well, The Ring is.

120
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:38,224
They wired a million dollars
into his account.

121
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,360
Enemy of my enemy is
my friend, kind of thing.

122
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,328
We need to know who
The Ring wants dead.

123
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,997
There's nothing this clown
can do that I can't do.

124
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,199
I'm perfect for this mission.

125
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,501
Still, we're going
with Bartowski on this one.

126
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:50,835
He'll assume Rafe's identity

127
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,437
in order to learn
the Ring's target.

128
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:55,306
The Intersect is performing.
He can do this. He's ready.

129
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:56,874
Right, Walker?

130
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,043
Chuck wants to be a spy.

131
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,011
Hello, team Bartowski.

132
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:10,851
Tempt anyone with
a tasty treat, huh?

133
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,721
What's with him?

134
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,623
Stallion had a date last night;
must have gotten lucky.

135
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,026
So, what is going on?

136
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,895
Who's this guy?

137
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,796
That is Rafe Gruber.

138
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:34,036
Wow, old Rafie boy's not such
a good guy now, is he?

139
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,404
What are we doing with him?

140
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:37,773
Not we, Chuck. You.

141
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,040
You're about
to assume an alias.

142
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,575
You're going to become

143
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,476
the world's most
dangerous assassin.

144
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:44,445
Becoming an alias, Chuck,

145
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,347
is unlike anything you've had
in your spy training before.

146
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:47,749
Under the most
stressful conditions,

147
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,517
you have to react only
like Rafe, not Chuck.

148
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,251
Guys, please.

149
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:53,486
I think I know a thing
or two about acting, all right?

150
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:55,454
I happened to play Perchik
in my high school's production

151
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:57,156
<i>of Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

152
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,757
And I was really quite good.

153
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:00,458
Ow! Ow!

154
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,459
What'd you do that for?!
I'm proving a point.

155
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,427
Everything you think
and feel, Chuck,

156
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:06,663
even your innate
reflexes have to change.

157
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,464
The kind of people that
Gruber associates with

158
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,432
will kill first,
ask questions later.

159
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,367
Yeah, okay fine, I get it.
What's the plan?

160
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,302
Well, Casey is going to elicit
the details from Gruber,

161
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,638
whom he's meeting,
where and when.

162
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,740
Then you'll go in
as Gruber, take his place.

163
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,040
Well, good luck there.

164
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,275
It's gonna be tough getting
information like that

165
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:23,777
out of a top
assassin like Rafe.

166
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:25,745
Nah, I can be
very persuasive.

167
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,492
Hey, let me talk to him for
a second. Step off, Bartowski.

168
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,427
I got a job to do.
Yeah, well, hey, so do I, okay?

169
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,629
I've got to learn
about Rafe

170
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,230
so I can get into
character for my mission.

171
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,898
For example:

172
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,867
Assassin is not normally
a booth one finds at Career Day.

173
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:55,036
How'd you initially get
interested in this line of work?

174
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,503
Why would I tell you anything?

175
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,505
I can think of
one burning reason why.

176
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:02,341
Okay. How about this one: What
was your most difficult hit?

177
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,311
I'll take the torture over this
man's questions. Roger that.

178
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,579
I'll take the torture
over this man's questions.

179
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,484
Hey, it's just a phone.

180
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:19,155
Gruber here.

181
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:20,657
Of course I'm ready.

182
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:22,558
Who do you think
you're dealing with?

183
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,761
Yeah, yeah, I know
where that is.

184
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:27,729
Across the street from
the cupcake place.

185
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:31,032
Because I like
cupcakes, that's why.

186
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:34,034
Who doesn't like
a good cupcake?

187
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,303
I'll be there.

188
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,471
Not bad, Bartowski.

189
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,773
Who the hell is Bartowski?

190
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:48,897
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

191
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:26,839
Look at that guy.

192
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:30,642
Chuck's the greatest lady
killer Burbank has ever seen.

193
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,611
He's a real "chuck" magnet.

194
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,446
Please with the puns.

195
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,482
Terrible timing for my
number one employee Morgan

196
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,651
to be away at
a leadership seminar.

197
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:40,186
Due to a clerical oversight,
we received

198
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,187
triple the number of Crock-Pots
I may have intended.

199
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:44,222
I'm excited about
dinner tonight.

200
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:46,489
Oh, yeah, yeah, me, too.

201
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:47,823
What's that guy's secret
with women?

202
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:49,990
What, has he got some kind
of deal with the devil?

203
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:51,890
I've narrowed it down.

204
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,825
Either mind controlling LSD
or sorcery.

205
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,159
El Segundo School of Finance
has taught me

206
00:09:57,227 --> 00:10:00,229
when you try to sell a house,
bake some cookies.

207
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,198
Make the place
smell familiar.

208
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:03,766
We're gonna do
the same thing here.

209
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,034
Except with gumbo.

210
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,169
Folks smell something
cooking in that Crock-Pot,

211
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:08,903
make them want to buy
the fool thing.

212
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:10,939
Need a volunteer.

213
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,842
You look like
you've peeled a few spuds

214
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,410
in your day, Casey.

215
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:19,145
And I would have picked you
if these two dipsticks

216
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:20,146
hadn't been faking sick

217
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,581
to get out of
chopping and dicing.

218
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:24,483
Wash your filthy hands, boys.

219
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,089
Hey, um, I'm cooking
dinner tonight

220
00:10:31,157 --> 00:10:32,991
for my family, Hannah,

221
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:35,193
and my special chicken
pepperoni recipe

222
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,393
takes a little time to prep,

223
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:37,994
so I don't know how long
the mission is,

224
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:39,596
but I need a hard
out by 5:00. Mm.

225
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,164
I can give you a hard out
with these five.

226
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,699
Get your priorities
straight.

227
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:47,935
You okay in here?

228
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:50,037
Yeah, yeah. I'll
be out in a sec.

229
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,677
I see how that guy
looks at you.

230
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:04,782
I bet he has no clue what to do
to a beautiful

231
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,485
woman like you.

232
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,090
But I do.

233
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,894
I will take such good care
of you, sweetheart.

234
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,333
All set.

235
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,300
Quick thing I gotta do first.

236
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:45,249
Okay, ready when you are.

237
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,986
Hi.

238
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,055
I miss those lips.

239
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,056
What, these old things?

240
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,691
I'm gonna be thinking
about last night

241
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:59,626
when I'm on my install.

242
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:01,093
What are you doing today?

243
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:02,995
Yeah, same thing, install.

244
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:04,729
Big, huge, complicated.

245
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,297
Probably faking my way
through most of it.

246
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:09,099
But hey, how about I come
and pick you up before dinner?

247
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,067
That's great.

248
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:20,275
Definitely a deal
with the devil.

249
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:22,276
I am so lonely.

250
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,681
Come on.

251
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,219
I can pass for a cold-blooded
killer, right?

252
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:34,422
What happened to Rafe?

253
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:40,125
What?

254
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,692
Imbecile can't go in alone.

255
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:43,026
<i>Hey, where
am I going?</i>

256
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:44,627
<i>Chuck, Rafe wasn't going</i>

257
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:46,362
<i>to meet with your usual spies.</i>

258
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:49,566
<i>These guys are a little more
old-fashioned.</i>

259
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,135
<i>Heard a story this cugine
whacked this guy</i>

260
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:53,469
during his spaghetti dinner.

261
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,569
The coroner couldn't tell

262
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,470
between the marinara
and the mess.

263
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:58,972
Hey, boss,
someone to see you.

264
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:01,942
Well, well, well,

265
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,144
Rafe Gruber.

266
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,945
Your reputation precedes you.

267
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,080
This is my coworker.

268
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:09,648
You may call
him John.

269
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,650
How ya doin'?

270
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:12,551
John doesn't talk much.

271
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:15,054
I know you from somewhere?

272
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,955
Doubt it.

273
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:19,891
When we had previous dealings
with our mutual friends,

274
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,627
you had more trepidation
about letting us I.D. you.

275
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:26,462
Not many people have seen
my face and lived.

276
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,429
Consider it an honor.

277
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,069
Look, I'm not much
for foreplay,

278
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,137
so forgive me
if I'm a little rude.

279
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:41,305
Who's my target?

280
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:43,840
No one thinks
this guy looks familiar?

281
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,077
You got cousins in Philly?

282
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:47,978
No.

283
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,782
I'm a huge fan
of your work.

284
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,218
Can I ask you
something?

285
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,119
What was your toughest hit?

286
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:55,923
You want to know
my toughest hit?

287
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:57,824
Look, I was just asking.

288
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:59,158
Yeah, take it
easy, boss.

289
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,893
You shut your mouth!

290
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:03,261
You think it's okay to ask
a guy you just met

291
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:04,562
something personal like that?

292
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:07,231
I really didn't mean
no disrespect, I swear.

293
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,315
Your toughest assignment's
always your next one.

294
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,850
You forget that, then you die.

295
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,721
You okay, Walker?

296
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:37,390
Yeah, yeah, it's
just this alias thing.

297
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:38,891
It must be a lot
for Chuck.

298
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,726
He's not a very
good liar.

299
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:41,994
Listen to him.

300
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:43,228
He's completely living the lie.

301
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,397
I know, but he's not like
you and me.

302
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:48,566
We're both used to living
somebody else's life.

303
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,335
That's the job.

304
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,437
Yeah, but where does
the job end?

305
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:56,974
I can barely remember
who I am anymore.

306
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,076
CHUCK I'm a busy guy,
so what's the name?

307
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:02,345
Who do our mutual friends
want me to kill?

308
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,146
The guy's name is...
I remember now!

309
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:05,914
You look like this
hotshot sniper

310
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:07,816
I served with a while back.

311
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:09,317
Name Alex Coburn,

312
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:11,218
ring a bell?

313
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,391
What are you trying to say?

314
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:24,727
Simple. This guy isn't
who he says he is.

315
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:26,162
Maybe he's some kind of fed.

316
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:27,397
Damn it!
Casey's been made.

317
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:29,065
We need to get them
out of there.

318
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,499
How are we supposed
to do that

319
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,534
without getting
everybody else killed?

320
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:32,901
We need that name, Walker.

321
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,802
We need to know who
the Ring wants dead.

322
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:38,239
Are you implying that this guy,
my guy, is a cop?

323
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:40,174
That's exactly what I'm saying.

324
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:42,076
So what does that say about you?

325
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,016
If he's a cop...

326
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,922
I'll kill him myself.

327
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:03,685
Do him, Rafe!

328
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:06,154
What are you
waiting for?

329
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:07,654
Quit stalling.
Keep stalling, Chuck.

330
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:08,655
We need more time.

331
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:09,656
We're waiting for backup.

332
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:10,656
Time's running out.

333
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,557
Kill him.

334
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:18,465
I'm not a murderer.

335
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,767
I'm an assassin!

336
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:20,834
What's the damn difference?

337
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,735
What's the damn
difference?

338
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:24,271
I don't kill because I like it.

339
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,006
I kill because it's a means
to something.

340
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,940
In this case,
information.

341
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:30,342
Information that I wouldn't get
from a dead guy

342
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,310
per your suggestion!

343
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:38,815
Now you're gonna tell me,
who's your informant?

344
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:40,050
Who's the leak?

345
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:42,919
Why would I tell you anything?

346
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,121
Sell it.

347
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:46,389
Wait!

348
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,790
I got something

349
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,758
special for occasions
such as these.

350
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,032
Is this stuff sterile?

351
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,467
I take pride

352
00:17:01,468 --> 00:17:02,802
in my work, all right?

353
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:05,070
I want to kill him, not some
secondary infection.

354
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:27,722
No.

355
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,758
<i>Tell me what you know!</i>

356
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:53,276
Move!

357
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:54,947
Move, move, move!

358
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,315
Everyone, move it! Move it!

359
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,183
Oh, my God, Sarah!

360
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,651
Sarah, I'm
freaking out right now!

361
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,953
I've never been so happy
to see you in my life!

362
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,053
Stop it!

363
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,221
You're not you,
you're Rafe.

364
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:06,022
You have to be him
in this situation.

365
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:08,224
Think what he would do.
Live the lie.

366
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,480
Come on, move!
We gotta split up!

367
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,381
We'll contact you later
with your assignment!

368
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,382
Rafe,
You're incredible!

369
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,283
Yeah, whatever. It's my job.

370
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,559
Good work, team.

371
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:59,065
Wow, Bartowski really sold it.

372
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:03,036
For a second, I hardly
even recognized him.

373
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:07,273
Guys, I told you

374
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,208
I needed a hard-out at 5:00!

375
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:10,776
How am I gonna get
everything done?

376
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,411
I gotta cook dinner,
my apartment's a pigsty,

377
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,312
gotta pick up Hannah,
take a shower...

378
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:15,479
Where is everybody?

379
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,915
Walker and Shaw knew
you were in over your head.

380
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:20,017
They went back to your place
to fix dinner

381
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,586
for your date.
They did, huh?

382
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:22,654
Weird, huh?

383
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:24,622
Walker helping you get laid.

384
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,960
Um, hey, Casey, I'm...
I'm sorry about your tooth.

385
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:32,462
That's all right. At least
you got one with a cavity.

386
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,430
Saved me a trip
to the dentist.

387
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:35,866
You did good work, Chuck.

388
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,834
Proud of you.

389
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,107
You think you can be me?

390
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,409
You shut your mouth.

391
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,677
Where are you
taking Rafe?

392
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:48,578
Interrogation.
Just wish

393
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:49,879
I could do it
myself.

394
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,547
You think you can be me?!

395
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,386
Uh, Case,

396
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,454
back there on
the mission,

397
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,355
I flashed on

398
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,554
the name "Alex Coburn."
Who is that?

399
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:12,588
You mind your damn business.

400
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,699
Oh, hey!

401
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,234
Hi!

402
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,602
Let's go eat.

403
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,205
I'm not gonna lie
to you, boys,

404
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:35,240
Bartowski is killing it
with the ladies.

405
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:36,807
I know.

406
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:39,143
First there was
that hot girl from Stanford.

407
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,744
Jill.
Yeah.

408
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,679
Then the brunette with
the overpriced deli.

409
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:48,050
Lou. She was a fine, miniature
piece of woman.

410
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:49,418
And now Hannah.

411
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,552
I'd like to moisturize her feet
with my saliva.

412
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,587
Don't you get it?
None of them matter.

413
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:55,289
Chuck may try
to replace her,

414
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,190
but when he's with
Sarah, the light

415
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,726
in his eyes
shines brightly.

416
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:01,762
Damn onions!

417
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,006
Oh, knife.

418
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:18,540
I want expectations
to be managed here.

419
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:19,975
I'm not Chef Boyardee.

420
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:21,609
Just looking forward
to hanging out with your sister.

421
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,510
I like this one,
Chuck.

422
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,180
Oh, my God, Chuck,

423
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,815
this looks amazing.

424
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:32,184
And smells amazing, too.

425
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:34,052
Dude, I thought
you worked all day.

426
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:35,553
How'd you find time
to do this?

427
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:37,454
Um, you know,
it's a, it's a juggling act.

428
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:39,490
No biggie.
I just threw it together.

429
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,159
Uh, Devon, you want to help me
with the wine?

430
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:44,694
Smells delish.

431
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:46,763
My taste buds are fist bumping
each other, bro.

432
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,730
Red okay?

433
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,033
Listen, I didn't
do any of this, okay?

434
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:52,367
I didn't buy the cheese.

435
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:53,635
I didn't
make the dinner.

436
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:54,870
Thank God,
I can tell you the truth.

437
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:56,304
Stop. Stop.

438
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:57,505
If you keep talking,

439
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:58,640
I'm going to have
to lie to your sister,

440
00:21:58,641 --> 00:21:59,807
and I can't do that anymore.

441
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,442
I'm not cut out
for this, Chuck.

442
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:02,876
I'm not like you.

443
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:04,278
I'm sorry. I get it.

444
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,046
Look, from now on,
if Ellie asks you something,

445
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:07,981
just say, "I don't know."
That's not a lie.

446
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:16,188
I lied.

447
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:18,823
I'm a liar.

448
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:20,925
I've been telling you for
years that I love this dish.

449
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:22,159
And it's been horrible.

450
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,728
And now, I can tell you,
honestly, that this is

451
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:26,696
fantastic.

452
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:31,467
Well, yeah. I think you're just,
you're just being polite.

453
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:32,701
It's not really my best.

454
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:34,169
No, it is, actually.

455
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,037
The others were
quite horrible.

456
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,539
Devon, can you believe
that Chuck made this?

457
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,074
I don't know.

458
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,811
Isn't this
chicken moist?

459
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:45,113
Chuck's chicken?

460
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:47,081
This chicken?

461
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,982
Chuck's chicken.

462
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:52,152
Um...

463
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:54,787
Hannah, don't you think
Chuck's chicken is moist?

464
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:55,921
Actually, I, um...

465
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:58,189
I'd like to make a toast.

466
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,693
Um, you know how, in life,

467
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,595
there's always something
that just doesn't line up?

468
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:11,165
Like, um, either you're
working at the wrong job

469
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,533
or dating the wrong guy,

470
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:16,837
or you're eating
some really bad meal?

471
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:18,004
Uh, but

472
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,405
right at this second,

473
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:21,773
I feel like I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

474
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:24,041
And I want to
thank all of you

475
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,009
for making me
feel that way.

476
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:31,313
Hope dessert
doesn't suck.

477
00:23:31,314 --> 00:23:32,581
Um, cheers.

478
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:34,482
Cheers.

479
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:51,028
I managed to sneak
us out some chicken.

480
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:53,663
I don't want to brag,
but it turned out pretty good.

481
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:56,968
Oh, uh, no, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

482
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,706
I'm clocking out. Have
you got this covered?

483
00:23:58,707 --> 00:24:01,609
Uh, yeah.

484
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,053
This is cool.

485
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,087
Is this new?

486
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:34,222
Uh, yeah.

487
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,490
Yeah.
Little perk of the job.

488
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,191
You know, just testing it out.
Work thing.

489
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:41,595
Listen, I, um, I
know this is fast,

490
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:43,830
but my parents
are coming in

491
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:45,632
from Santa Barbara
tonight for dinner.

492
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:48,301
Oh. Yeah, and I wasn't
going to ask you to come,

493
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:50,836
but since I got to hang
out with your family,

494
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:52,604
I'd love it if
you met mine.

495
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:55,540
Yeah, yeah.
I would love to meet them.

496
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:57,609
Bartowski, I need your
professional opinion.

497
00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:02,479
Your latest
little lady said

498
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:04,715
that you're some kind
of cooking expert.

499
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:07,384
I need your
palette's advice.

500
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:09,085
Uh, actually, you know,
my recipe last night

501
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:10,220
didn't really
come together.

502
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:11,321
That's not what she said.

503
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:12,489
She said she
couldn't wait

504
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,225
<i>to gobble up every bite.</i>

505
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:16,626
Mouth as pretty
as Hannah's,

506
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,228
she can taste
the difference.

507
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:19,229
That's the mouth

508
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,130
of a professional.

509
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:31,571
Hello?
Burbank Buy More.

510
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,574
The-the flavor profile's
not quite right.

511
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:37,776
I think it could use a little
Worcestershire sauce, maybe.

512
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:40,011
And, oh, oh, wait.
Is that frozen okra?

513
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,514
Good taste in women,
bad taste in food.

514
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:50,686
Jeffrey, if you double-dip,
we all may die.

515
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:52,287
Who was that?
What did they want?

516
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:53,889
Um, it was a wrong number.

517
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,924
They were asking
for some guy named Rafe.

518
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:59,693
That's odd.
What did you tell him?

519
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:04,131
Um, I told them that this
was a Buy More phone.

520
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,232
Uh, but the guy? Just,
he wouldn't listen,

521
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,567
and he kept saying that he would
be here, in like, two minutes.

522
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,535
Oh, here.

523
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,197
What do you think you're
doing with that watch?

524
00:26:42,198 --> 00:26:44,265
I can explain.

525
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,833
There is no
explanation.

526
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:47,734
Give me this watch.

527
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:55,075
For a bad ass killer to own
such a piece of crap watch?

528
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:56,476
Crazy!

529
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:58,411
So, we bought you
a little present,

530
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:00,980
though "bought"
is a very loose term.

531
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:04,450
Look at that.

532
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:07,585
Gold. Wow.
It's very understated.

533
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,353
What are you doing here
at Buy More, anyway?

534
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:11,122
What, are you getting some
speaker wire to, uh...

535
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:12,122
What do I look like,
a workaholic?

536
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,389
A man's got to have

537
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,490
hobbies other than murder.

538
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:16,025
I was here browsing music.

539
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:18,093
Hey, you saved us

540
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,461
from getting pinched
yesterday, huh?

541
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:21,062
What a guy.
Ooh, I could hit you.

542
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:23,431
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

543
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:24,799
Never seen
anything close

544
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,234
to what you
pulled off, Rafe.

545
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,135
The trick is
making it look easy.

546
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:31,671
You did us a favor, and in
turn, we did you a favor.

547
00:27:31,738 --> 00:27:33,172
We tracked down
the location

548
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:34,639
of the guy you're
supposed to kill.

549
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,340
Good news, huh?

550
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:38,241
Good news?

551
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,978
That is very good news.

552
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,516
Yeah. Enough of that.

553
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,492
Oh, I'm sorry if
this is a bad time.

554
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,627
No. Hey, Walker.
Come on in.

555
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:06,802
Listen, Shaw, I just
wanted to say, um...

556
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,871
What?

557
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,874
Well, I-I came by to, um...

558
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,544
I'm sorry. Can you please
put some clothes on?

559
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,612
Oh. Yeah.

560
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:28,152
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior last night.

561
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,120
No apology necessary.

562
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:32,089
Okay.

563
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,424
Um...

564
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:36,259
Well...

565
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,995
You still, um...

566
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:41,730
You okay with
this whole Chuck/Hannah thing?

567
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:44,732
Thank you for asking.

568
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:50,237
But that's not really the change

569
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,472
that I'm having trouble with.

570
00:28:58,144 --> 00:29:00,411
So, who's the mark?

571
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:02,379
Who am I taking out?

572
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:03,613
He's in the hotel room
right over there.

573
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:05,414
Got a girl with him.

574
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:07,315
A real hot piece of tail.

575
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,684
I think they're going to plow.

576
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:10,119
Perfect distraction.

577
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,319
How am I supposed
to see him?

578
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,288
With this.

579
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:15,956
Naturally.

580
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:17,890
We hear you're one of five guys
that can make this shot.

581
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,859
It's over
half a mile away.

582
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:21,763
Well, apparently, my
reputation precedes me.

583
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:23,764
Again.

584
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:43,179
Oh, my God.

585
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,080
What?

586
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,350
SARAH
It's just really difficult

587
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:50,885
to see Chuck
become a different person.

588
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,453
That's the
mission, Walker.

589
00:29:52,454 --> 00:29:54,388
No, it's not the
mission. It's...

590
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:55,789
Everything.

591
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,024
Take the shot.

592
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:58,792
It's how he pulled out
Casey's tooth,

593
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,560
and how he burnt that asset
a couple of weeks ago,

594
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:01,862
and the way he
lies to Hannah.

595
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:04,898
I mean,
it's so easy for him.

596
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:07,134
Chuck's changing.

597
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:12,705
He's becoming a spy.

598
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:14,939
I know. I know.

599
00:30:15,006 --> 00:30:18,470
But lives are being
affected here.

600
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,972
Sounds like he's not
the only one who's changing.

601
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,742
It's like I'm watching
Chuck disappear,

602
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,576
and the further
he gets from who he is,

603
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:30,611
the...
Cap him.

604
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,612
It's okay. Talk to me, Sarah.

605
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,147
Come on.

606
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:37,217
Well, the more I want
to remember who I am-

607
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:39,854
who I was before
all of this-

608
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:43,891
Well, if this is
you, I like you.

609
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,358
I want more.

610
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,495
I've been on this assignment
for almost three years,

611
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:52,097
and I've never told
anybody my real name.

612
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:53,665
Not even Chuck?

613
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,199
No.

614
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,100
Not even Chuck.

615
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,037
So, what is it?

616
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,541
What's happening?

617
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:06,876
What's going on?
Shut up! Shut up!

618
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:08,844
Feels so weird
to say it out loud.

619
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:10,779
Yeah, it's just, you
never seemed like a Sarah.

620
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,680
It's 'cause I'm not.

621
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:14,616
What is it, Rafe?

622
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:16,985
I'm Sam.

623
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:18,219
Hmm.

624
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,189
My real name is Sam.

625
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:24,625
Sam?

626
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:26,994
Well...

627
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:29,396
I'm going to kiss
you now, Sam.

628
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,005
Sam?!

629
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,106
Sam?

630
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:53,607
Who's Sam?

631
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:55,508
The guy you're supposed
to whack is Daniel Shaw.

632
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,410
The organization that
had us contract you

633
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:58,679
thought this
Shaw guy was dead.

634
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,249
Turns out,
he's just not dead yet.

635
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:03,552
This is the right guy
all right.

636
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,221
So, who the hell is Sam?

637
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:08,723
Sam...

638
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,691
Sam's the girl.

639
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,494
My girl.

640
00:32:13,562 --> 00:32:14,762
Sort of.

641
00:32:14,763 --> 00:32:18,067
Me and Sam are on
again, off again.

642
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:21,440
Driving everyone in my
life a little crazy.

643
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:24,143
I hate those "Will they
or won't they?" things.

644
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,711
Just do it already!

645
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,846
If you and this girl
love each other so much,

646
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:28,981
what's keeping you apart?

647
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,882
It's complicated.

648
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:33,818
Sort of came down to a question
of work.

649
00:32:33,853 --> 00:32:35,220
What are you gonna do?

650
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,521
You got your priorities
straight.

651
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,122
Right?

652
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,091
And plus, she's the one who's
always pushing me to be better

653
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,326
at my job in the first place.

654
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,227
Women- screwed
if you do,

655
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,862
not screwed
if you don't.

656
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,596
Wait a second.

657
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:50,400
The guy you're supposed to whack
is banging your girl?

658
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,737
It sure seems that
way, doesn't it? Huh.

659
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:59,776
Jeez, this unlucky guy is
about to get double dead.

660
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:03,479
SHAW
Do we have a situation?

661
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:05,647
I tried contacting the agents
transporting Gruber,

662
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:07,048
but they're not responding.

663
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:08,115
They checked in yet?

664
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:10,651
No.
Damn it!

665
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,920
Get me Bartowski's last-known
location.

666
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:15,888
What are you waiting on, Rafe?

667
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:23,928
There.

668
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,829
That's better.

669
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,538
What's your problem, man?

670
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,440
Ice him!
I can't do it.

671
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:42,310
A bullet's too good
for this guy.

672
00:33:42,377 --> 00:33:45,645
Yeah, you gotta look
this jerk in the eye

673
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:46,846
before you cap him.

674
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,881
Yeah, yeah, my thoughts exactly.

675
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:51,417
I'm going over there.

676
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:52,751
You two stay put.

677
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:54,419
Don't worry, Rafe.
We got your back.

678
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,687
Anything weird goes down,
I'll take out the whole room.

679
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:58,389
I ain't a marksman
like you are,

680
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,023
but I make sure
they're all dead.

681
00:34:00,024 --> 00:34:02,926
Yeah, that's...
real good.

682
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:23,346
Open the door!

683
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:24,748
I know you're in there!

684
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:27,183
I will kick this door down!

685
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:29,151
What's going on?

686
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:30,919
Shut your mouth!
I'll deal with you later.

687
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,287
What's your problem?
My problem is that

688
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:36,857
nobody messes with Rafe Gruber.

689
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:39,292
They're watching us.

690
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,630
I'd like you to remove those.

691
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:46,598
No, no, no. These are the hands

692
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,199
that are gonna
kill you, Shaw.

693
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,100
What are you doing?!

694
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,369
You stole my girl.

695
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,372
I'm going to end you
for taking Sam!

696
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:03,078
You had your chance
and you blew it.

697
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,520
Who the hell are you?

698
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:29,065
Ah, Shaw, wait!

699
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,134
Shaw, enough!

700
00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:38,207
Would you stop already?

701
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:40,375
I'm trying to sell myself
as Rafe!

702
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:43,911
They're across the street
with a sniper rifle.

703
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:45,613
They're gonna kill all of us!

704
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:48,716
<i>No, I'm gonna kill all of you.</i>

705
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,728
Come on. Flash.

706
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,367
Flash!

707
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,836
Come on! Flash!

708
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,650
Wake up, pretty.

709
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:29,718
Come on.
That's it.

710
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,886
That's it.

711
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:31,987
Come here, yeah.

712
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:33,888
No, don't shoot!
Please don't!

713
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:36,991
You two got it bad
for this blond.

714
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,993
Can't say
I blame you.

715
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm gonna make it easy
on both of you.

716
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:43,096
Take her out
of the equation.

717
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,200
No!

718
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:24,296
Five people in the world
can make this shot, huh?

719
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:26,364
Guess I'm one of them.

720
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,810
Hi.

721
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,046
Um...

722
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:41,282
you said that I could come to
you if I ever needed to talk.

723
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,617
Yeah. I'm so glad.

724
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:45,852
Please, start at the beginning.

725
00:37:47,755 --> 00:37:49,722
I feel like I'm living
a lie, Ellie.

726
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,358
I used to be able
to compartmentalize

727
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:55,327
these things, but it's, like,
it's all the time now.

728
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:57,295
It never stops.

729
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:03,767
I feel like I'm not me anymore.

730
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:07,137
I think I know what
this is about.

731
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:09,572
You do?

732
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,074
Maybe things are moving too fast
with Hannah,

733
00:38:12,142 --> 00:38:15,645
and even though you
really like her,

734
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:17,612
it feels dishonest because
the truth is

735
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:20,015
that you still have feelings
for Sarah.

736
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:23,384
Does that sound
about right?

737
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:28,088
See, this is... this is why
I don't come talk to you, Ellie,

738
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:29,656
'cause you're half a spy.

739
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:31,324
I'm sorry, Chuck,
maybe that's not it.

740
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:32,591
No. No, no, no.

741
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:34,859
What I mean by that is
that you're an excellent

742
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:36,827
half a spy.

743
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:40,629
Thanks.

744
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,530
Any time.

745
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:12,824
Hi!

746
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,892
Hi. I'm, uh,
I'm Chuck.

747
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,128
Can we talk
for a second?

748
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:20,430
Oh, yeah.

749
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:22,331
Sorry.

750
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:39,313
Are you okay, Chuck?

751
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:41,715
What's the matter?

752
00:39:41,783 --> 00:39:45,019
You know how much
I like you, right?

753
00:39:48,423 --> 00:39:49,989
What's wrong?

754
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,958
Hannah, there are things
in my life

755
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:58,930
that you can't understand,
and I can't explain them to you.

756
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:04,234
I've been dishonest,
and it's not fair to you.

757
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,603
So I have to end this...

758
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,710
...because you deserve to be
with someone

759
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:13,711
who you can know

760
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,847
completely and...

761
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:24,121
I, um, I thought
you were a nice guy.

762
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,422
No, I am a nice guy.

763
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,757
No, you're not a nice guy.

764
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,692
We had sex this morning,

765
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,194
and now you are dumping me.

766
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,228
No, it's not like that.

767
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,130
Then how is it?
Explain it to me!

768
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:41,966
Look, I have dated a lot
of liars before,

769
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:44,534
so I usually know how
to spot them,

770
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:49,234
but you- you're, like,
the best I've ever seen.

771
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:56,173
I hope that your lies
keep you warm at night.

772
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,462
So, now that the Ring
knows you're alive,

773
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,097
looks like you're gonna
be down here for a while,

774
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:28,799
so I bought you that.

775
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,100
It's a Crock-Pot.
They're practically

776
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:31,534
giving them away
at Buy More.

777
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:34,670
And just so you know,

778
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:39,474
the Castle is outside of Bamboo
Dragon's delivery radius.

779
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,743
Thank you... Sam.
