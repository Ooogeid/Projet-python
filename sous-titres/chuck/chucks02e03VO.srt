1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,700
Are we clear?

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,100
Yeah. Let's go.

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,900
BOGOTA, COLUMBIA 2005

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's move.

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,500
Hey!

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,800
Here, take the case.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Mr. Anderson.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,900
???　No need to shoot, okay?

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
You got it, sweetheart?

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,700
Yeah.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Yeah, I got it.

12
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,800
Well... give it to him.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
Nice shot, Mrs. Anderson.

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
Why, thank you,
Mr. Anderson.

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,500
Chuck.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,900
Hi.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
- Um...
- Hello, Chuck.

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,500
Miss me?

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,400
Hey. That was a fast date.

20
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,800
Is everything okay
with you and Sarah?

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Everything,
except her ex is in town.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,300
This dude has

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,600
a really nasty habit
of popping into my life

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
at the most
inopportune of times.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,300
Stalker ex. Not awesome.

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Does he know
that you and Sarah are dating?

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah. I just think he's taking
the whole

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
"we can still be friend"
thing to heart.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't sweat it, Chuck.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,900
This guy can't hold
a candle to you.

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,800
And what does he have
that's so great?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,900
Uh, that would be good looks,

33
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,500
sophistication,
an exciting career,

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000
and much more history
with Sarah.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,600
You know what?

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm sure that Sarah
will take care of it.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,300
This guy will be
out of your life in no time.

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,200
Something tells me,
it won't be quite that simple.

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
Do you want to talk?

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,600
Watch something else?

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,600
No. No, I'm good.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna hang.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,300
I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine.

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,000
So, I'm just gonna sit here
alone,

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,900
not technically, but,
you know, emotionally.

46
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,400
Okay, look at this.

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,100
This is what
I'm talking about.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,300
I'm worried about Lester
as the new assistant manager.

49
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Why, is
he making you work?

50
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,400
Please, Chuck, I have
mad-work avoidance skills.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,100
True... true.

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,000
No, he's drunk
with power, man.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,900
I once read that Mussolini
started in retail.

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,100
- Really? Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,900
It could be worse.

56
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,000
It could be Casey.

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Lunch break:
Orange Orange.

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,400
Yogurt again? Can't
we have a meatball sub?

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,100
We're not eating, idiot.
We got a new mission.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Does it have anything
to do with Bryce-

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,200
- why he's in town?
- I don't know.

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
If I know Larkin,
he's probably here

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,900
for a roll in the hay
with Walker.

64
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,600
Get down!

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Kick it, baby!

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Look at them.

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Visiting from
their Mighty Jocks

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,600
sporting goods store
with their cola and tacos.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They can't treat my store
like a frat house.

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,500
Grimes... Grimes.

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,900
Come here.
Come here.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Get in there
and kick those ruffians out.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
That's Mitt and his merry band
of maniacs.

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,100
Not only are the giants,
they are psychopaths.

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,000
Look, I'm sorry, Morgan.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Management means
making tough decisions.

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,600
Now go in there
and kick them out!

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,100
I got it! I got him!

79
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,300
He's got him.

80
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,700
You guys having a good time?

81
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,600
Good, good. Sorry...
Can I get a second, please?

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,100
One second, man.
I'm in the middle of a play.

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,900
Right. Well, um...

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,600
Okay. Well, obviously,
you haven't heard.

85
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Heard what?

86
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,500
We have some new rules here
at the Buy More.

87
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,800
Basically, uh,
we just, uh-uh...

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
are requiring customers
to clean up after themselves

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and allowing others to enjoy

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,100
the various video game
consoles-

91
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,900
specifically,
the Madden football, you know.

92
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,400
And-and if it's possible,

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,400
if we could all just, kind of,
as group here-

94
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,300
myself included, okay?-

95
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,000
use our indoor voices,

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
- as my mother used to saY. 
- We're so sorry.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,900
We didn't mean to offend
anybody.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
We didn't know
you had new rules.

99
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,900
I'm going to clean
up my lunch.

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,200
Thank you so much, man.
I was nervous about asking you.

101
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
Oh, you're just gonna...?

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,200
There you go, buddy.
We're all cleaned up.

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,500
And, dude...
if you ever interrupt

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,000
another one of my games,

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,300
gonna be your face
that gets smushed.

106
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
You understand that?

107
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,400
Per-perfect.

108
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
All right, buddy. Thanks.

109
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Any idea what Bryce is
doing in town?

110
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
He's not staying
with you, is he?

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
Not now, Chuck.

112
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Is there something
you would like to share

113
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,900
with the rest of the class,
Mr. Bartowski?

114
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,500
No, sorry, General.

115
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,600
Zipping it up.

116
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,500
The Fulcrum threat is far worse
than it originally appeared.

117
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,200
We've learned
one of their agents stole

118
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,300
an encrypted microchip

119
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,200
containing top secret
information out of the DNI.

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,100
The information on the chip
contained

121
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,000
highly classified intelligence-
a refresh for the new Intersect.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,900
Is there anything on that chip
that could compromise our cover?

123
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,700
Unfortunately, yes.

124
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,500
Agent Larkin has learned
that Fulcrum hired Von Hayes,

125
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,300
a wealthy software magnet,
to decrypt the chip

126
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,600
and deliver the encoded
information back to them.

127
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,900
Mr. Hayes is throwing
a lavish party

128
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
at his Bel Air estate
this evening.

129
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
The finest dining,
music and food.

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,100
Your job will be to pose
as a married couple

131
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,800
and steal back the chip.

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
See? This is what I'm talking
about, General.

133
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Finally a mission I can
sink my teeth into.

134
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Dust off the tux,
polish up the dancing shoes...

135
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,900
No, Chuck.

136
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,900
This mission is going to require
a real spy.

137
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
Sorry I'm late.

138
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,000
L.A. traffic's still the worst.

139
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
Bryce will be posing
as Sarah's husband.

140
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,200
Chuck, you'll be posing
as a waiter.

141
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,400
Try and flash on and identify
the Fulcrum agent.

142
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Well, Mrs. Anderson.

146
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,800
<i>Hey, Casey.
Um, so what's the deal</i>

147
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,500
with the... with
the mission tonight?

148
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,200
Sarah said you were
working on the plan?

149
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,800
Yeah, yeah, we're
making it airtight

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
so even you can't
screw it up.

151
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
So what's the scoop
with the...

153
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
you know,
the Andersons?

154
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,100
Why, you worried Bryce
is going to steal your girl?

155
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Okay, you know what?
First of all,

156
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,500
Sarah and I are purely
professional,

157
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,400
so I resent any accusation
otherwise.

158
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,700
And second of all,
I can't take an interest

159
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
in my coworker's mission?

160
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
I mean, I figure
if I'm going to be stuck

161
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,500
being a spy for a while now,
I think, you know,

162
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
I want to learn
a little lesson from...

163
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,200
the master.

164
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,500
Hmm.

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,600
All right, the microchip is
stored inside a vault

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,800
in Von Hayes' mansion.

167
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,000
All Bryce and Sarah
need to do,

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
is slip out of the main ballroom
and grab it.

169
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,100
Well, aren't people going
to be asking questions

170
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,900
if they see them snooping
around the house?

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,100
Bryce and Sarah will be
very affectionate.

172
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,500
That way, no one will ask
them any questions

173
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,800
when they're looking
for the vault.

174
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,600
That's the beauty of PDA.

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,800
The company really knows

176
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,500
how to put you
into a cute outfit.

177
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
We're not undercover yet, Bryce.

178
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,300
Well, you can't be
too careful.

179
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
You never know who's watching,
Mrs. Anderson.

180
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
Yeah, uh... about the Andersons,

181
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,700
I really think
that we should

182
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
keep it strictly
a cover this time.

183
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,800
Okay.
Everything all right?

184
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
Yeah, it's just with Fulcrum
getting closer and closer,

185
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
we should be... focused.

186
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,700
You know,
no distractions.

187
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,500
You're right.
Yeah... no distractions.

188
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,100
I have to admit, though,

189
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
it sure was fun while it lasted.

190
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I've always found that lunch
travels better in a bag,

191
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,700
but maybe that's just me.

192
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Yeah. Well... Lester
made me kick the Mighty Jocks

193
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,000
out of the home theater
so Mitt burritoed me.

194
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,000
Buddy, what have I told you
about direct confrontation

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,200
with the Mighty Jocks-
Mitt specifically?

196
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,900
Run with my tail between my legs
and go get John Casey.

197
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,800
I know.

198
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,700
Man, you ever have someone
show up in your life

199
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,300
and just make you feel
so damn small?

200
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,800
Yeah, that...

201
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,200
Buddy, there's always going
to be someone that's cooler

202
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
or better-looking
or more athletic than us.

203
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,900
But there's one thing
we have that they don't.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,700
I got a beard.

205
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,900
Brains. Brains! And if
we use our brains,

206
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,000
then we're going to be okay.

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,300
You're right, dude, I know.

208
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,400
All right, good talk.

209
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,600
Uh...

210
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,100
There you go.

211
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Shmutz.

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,300
- Hey. 
- Hey. Hey, I was just on my way home.

213
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I got this thing to do
with Sarah.

214
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,500
What's, what's going on?

215
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,400
Uh, well, I went
by the Orange Orange

216
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
to ask Sarah to be
a bridesmaid...

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
That is so sweet, Ellie.

218
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,300
Yeah. Um... Chuck,

219
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,900
when I got there,
I saw her holding hands

220
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,700
with another guy.

221
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,200
I think it might be her ex.

222
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Really? Uh, did you, did you get
a good look at him?

223
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
Well, I couldn't, 'cause
he was faced the other way,

224
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
but, uh, dark hair, sort
of classically handsome...

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
I don't know if I'd...

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,500
I'd call him
classically handsome.

227
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,100
Maybe from like
a weird angle

228
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,000
or from really far away,
maybe that...

229
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,800
They were holding hands, huh?

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,500
Yeah. I'm really
sorry, Chuck.

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,100
Don't be...

232
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,200
Don't be, Elle, why?
Why be sorry?

233
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
No, it's all good.

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,500
She was probably just
letting him down easy.

235
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,900
Trust me, things have never
been better between us.

236
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,900
Kick his butt!

237
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,500
Grimes, I thought
I told you

238
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,600
- to toss those meatheads.
- I tried, dude.

239
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
What do you want me to do?
Maybe they'll respond

240
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,500
to somebody who's
in a position of authority.

241
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,200
Don't you think

242
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,100
you should lead
by example, Lester?

243
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,800
Slovenly buffoons!

244
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,200
Okay, all right,
listen to me.

245
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,100
What about a plan
that doesn't require...

246
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,400
direct confrontation?

247
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Talk to me.

248
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
Pippin, he's Pippin.
Last play

249
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
of the game!
This is the last play!

250
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,000
Come on, you better
do this.

251
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Oh, oh,
what a pass!

252
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,700
I'm takin' it to the house!

253
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
Ten seconds.
Nine...

254
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,400
- Yes!
- eight...

255
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,300
seven...

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,900
six...

257
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
five...

258
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,300
four...

259
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,700
three...

260
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,600
two...

261
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,500
What the hell?

262
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,600
That was a
game-winning drive!

263
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,500
A game-winning
drive!

264
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,900
And now what
does it look like?

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,900
You know, kind of
hard to tell

266
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,000
a little bit by
the glare.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Super Bowl-winning drive!
Franchise mode!

268
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,100
All-Madden!

269
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I can tell
you're upset.

270
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,900
You could have asked us
to leave nicely.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,700
I didn't even want
to kick you guys out.

272
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm just an employee.

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,300
My boss made me do it.

274
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Who's your boss?

275
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,500
- Oh, come on...
- Who?

276
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,000
The guy over there, real skinny.

277
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,300
After work...

278
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,100
gonna kick both your asses.

279
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,600
Thank you.

280
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,100
Have a nice night.

281
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,200
You, too.

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
What, no rose for me this time,
lover boy?

283
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,500
Cute.

284
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,100
We're just protecting our cover.

285
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,400
Sales up at the
Buy More?

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,100
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

287
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,700
Buy More, Buy More is good.
We just got

288
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,800
a new MacBook SMC
firmware update.

289
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,600
So, you know,

290
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,200
things are a little nutty.
Mmm.

291
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,100
I can imagine.

292
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,700
That's...

293
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
So, uh, staying with Sarah, huh?

294
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Protecting our cover.

295
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
How are things between you guys?

296
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,400
They're good.

297
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,900
Good, good, good. Solid.

298
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,500
- Why? did she say something?
- No.

299
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
It's just she's a beautiful girl

300
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,300
pretending to be
your girlfriend.

301
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,700
I was afraid you'd let
the lines get blurred

302
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,800
and fall for her.

303
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,300
What?
Me, fall for Sarah?

304
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,200
Please.

305
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,200
Hey, guys.

306
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,600
Hey.

307
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,500
So, how do I look?

308
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,600
Good!

309
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah, yeah,
real good.

310
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,500
Red's not really
my color, so...

311
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,400
I forgot...

312
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,500
Or salmon or whatever

313
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
that is.

314
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome!

315
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,200
As you all know, today is
yours truly's birthday.

316
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,300
Thank you.

317
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,500
No, no, no, no.

318
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,100
Um, I have a lot
to be thankful for.

319
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
I'm rich, handsome,

320
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,400
an extraordinarily
gifted lover-

321
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
but, most importantly,
I know how to throw one hell

322
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
of party;
so let's get it on, people!

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,100
Cheers!

324
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,200
Hey, Bartowski,

325
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,000
Von Hayes is at table eight.
Grab a bottle

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
of wine,
see if you flash on him.

327
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
Pardon me, excuse me.

328
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,100
Any security
behind you?

329
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,000
No.

330
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,900
You're still a
great dancer.

331
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,200
You're a little rusty.

332
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
Yes, sir, of course.

333
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,000
Fantastic.

334
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,200
Will you just let me lead?

335
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
No.

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,600
Hey,

337
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,100
quit screwing around, Bartowski.

338
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,500
And get close to Von Hayes.

339
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
- Oh! - Whoa, hey!

340
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
- What the hell are you doing? 
- Oh!

341
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm so- I'm sorry.

342
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

343
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
No, no, stop! Stop!

344
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,500
- Stop!
- Okay, you know,

345
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,300
I'll go-
I'll get fresh

346
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,500
bottle.
 I'm so sorry, sir. You do that.

347
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,700
Good help is so hard
to find these days.

348
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,400
Casey, I didn't flash
on anything.

349
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
Keep looking,
get your head in the game.

350
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,700
The camera's on the east
and west walls, cross

351
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,300
for about two seconds.

352
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,300
Lambada!

353
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,400
The forbidden dance.

354
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,700
That's
the blind spot.

355
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,700
Get a room.

356
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,900
Right?

357
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,200
Oh! Oh!

358
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
- Are you on drugs? That was 
- No!

359
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,100
a thousand dollar bottle
of Lafite Rothschild.

360
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
- I'm so very sorry, sir.
- You're very sorry, sir?

361
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Were you dropped as a child
from very great height?

362
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,300
I- I actually, I couldn't
confirm or deny that.

363
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,200
Sir, is everything
all right?

364
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,500
Congratulations.

365
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,900
You have succeeded
in hiring

366
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,000
possiblY the worst
waiter in history!

367
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,100
You heard the man, Jorge.

368
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,800
You're fired.

369
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,300
I'll call security
to take you out.

370
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
No, no, no, no, no!

371
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,700
No, I need this job!
Please don't fire me.

372
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,200
- Have some compassion, some mercy! 
- Hello,

373
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,800
Mr. Hayes, do you have
my microchip?

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,900
Hello.

375
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,300
Well, my...

376
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,000
bosses don't like to wait.

377
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,900
Perhaps...

378
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,900
we could talk in private.

379
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's go!

380
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,600
Hey, ho, wait, no, no.

381
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, just let me finish
my shift.

382
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
Bartowski!

383
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,300
Shift's over.

384
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,600
Time to meet your maker.

385
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm too young,
upwardly mobile,

386
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,600
and handsome to die.

387
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,900
Don't worry, Morgan,

388
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,800
I'll take care of Anna
when you're gone.

389
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
I'd rather be drawn
and quartered.

390
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,900
Let's go, Morgan.

391
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,900
We can't go.

392
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
Mitt is going
to kill us, dude!

393
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hey, unhand me, now.

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
- All right, let's get it together here. 
- What?

395
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
All right,
I'm not scared of Mitt.

396
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
You are crazy, man.
I am not going anywhere.

397
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
That's why I get the girl.

398
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Dead...

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
man walkin'.

400
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,700
Oh, you know what?

401
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,400
Holy smokes,
I just remembered!

402
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,500
Big Mike wanted me

403
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,100
to finish this inventory
by tomorrow morning.

404
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,900
Morgan, you can't let a bully
like Mitt push you around.

405
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,200
This isn't high school.

406
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,900
No, it's worse.

407
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
This is Buy More.

408
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
It's all right.
It's all right.

409
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Moron.

410
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,500
Bryce and Sarah are at the vault; 
come back to the van.

411
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,200
No. I flashed on a FULCRUM agent
but I didn't see her face.

412
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
Wait, wait, wait-
we need to know she looks like.

413
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,400
Go back inside
and get me a real I.D.

414
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm locked out.

415
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Yeah, well, since I'm not
a complete idiot,

416
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,300
like a certain someone,
by which I mean you,

417
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,000
I tapped into the security
system.

418
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,100
Try it now.

419
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,300
Pretty impressive, Casey.

420
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,900
just get in there and find
the FULCRUM agent.

421
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,700
You got five minutes.

422
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,500
Go!

423
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,900
Is that Jorge?

424
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,500
You promised us
the decrypted chip

425
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,200
two weeks ago and instead
you're throwing

426
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,800
- a party. 
- Well, what's the point

427
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,100
of being rich
if you can't have a little fun?

428
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,900
You have decrypted
the information

429
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,600
on the chip?

430
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,200
Yes, yes, it's all finished.

431
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,400
The, um,

432
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,800
question is

433
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,400
where's my fee?

434
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,800
Forget the 15 million.

435
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,400
Oh, my God!

436
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,400
I think I'll just take my chip.

437
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,800
It's in my vault.

438
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,900
Um... I'll take you r...

439
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I'll take you right there.

440
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,400
Oh, Casey, Casey.

441
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,700
The microchip is not
in the vault.

442
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
It is on Von Hayes' keychain.

443
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,700
And I also got
a really good look

444
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
- at the FULCRUM agent.
- What'd she look like?

445
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,800
Oh, my gosh, dude, so awful.

446
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,300
I mean incredibly creepy.

447
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,800
Think... Think psycho
elfin queen.

448
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,900
Did you say FULCRUM?

449
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,300
- Sarah!
- Talk to me, Casey.

450
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,000
What's going on?

451
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,100
Von Hayes is on the move.

452
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,300
- Where? 
- He's headed for the front.

453
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,500
He's got the chip.

454
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,600
Freeze!
Federal agents.

455
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,300
Hey,

456
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,600
FULCRUM agent has Chuck.

457
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,900
She's leaving out
the back door.

458
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
- Sarah, what are you doing? 
- Chuck's in danger.

459
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,400
That FULCRUM agent will kill
him if we don't get...

460
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,800
No- our covers are
on that microchip.

461
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,700
If we don't get it,
all of us get killed.

462
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,600
Sarah!

463
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Bartowski and the CIA-
how could it not go wrong?

464
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,900
You gotta believe me!
You gotta believe me!

465
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,400
The whole creepy elfin thing

466
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,500
was a compliment, I swear!

467
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,800
Ever since my 6th grade

468
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
<i>librarian introduced
me to TheHobbit,</i>

469
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,600
I been hooked on 'em.
I don't know if it's the eyes

470
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,900
- or the ears...
- Shut up, Jorge!

471
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,500
Chuck, duck and cover!

472
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,800
Go!

473
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,900
Go!

474
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,700
Chuck!

475
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
You okay?

476
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,900
- Chuck. Hey.
- I'm, uh...

477
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
I... yeah, yeah.

478
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,700
Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
Run!

480
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,400
Oh, my...

481
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,100
Hi.

482
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,000
Hey.

483
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
I, uh, brought you
some gardenias.

484
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,100
They're my favorite.
How did you know?

485
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, I'm not an entirely
incompetent spy, you know?

486
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,000
Thank you.

487
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,200
And you can put them over there.

488
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,000
Bryce Larkin, huh?

489
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,000
I guess, no matter
what it is,

490
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll always come
in second to that guy.

491
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,100
Not always.

492
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,900
Ellie said you
had a concussion?

493
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,800
Oh, it's just a minor
concussion, I'm fine.

494
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,600
It's my ego that's hurt
more than anything.

495
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I don't believe it.

496
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,400
What's up, babe?

497
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
That is
Sarah's ex.

498
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,300
That guy just
won't back off.

499
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
You know what, Chuck
might be too nice

500
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,900
to say anything,
but I am not.

501
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,400
Whoa, whoa, hold on, babe.

502
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,100
Let me handle this.

503
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm sorry- it's my fault.

504
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,900
If I didn't get fired,
this never would've happened.

505
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,600
Hey, don't apologize, okay?

506
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,800
It is not your job
to protect me.

507
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,800
Well...

508
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,500
all things being considered,
that's probably a good thing.

509
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,300
Yeah, you have a lot
of good qualities,

510
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,900
but, uh, I'm not sure
"bodyguard" is one of them.

511
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,500
Hey, bro!

512
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,900
- Hey.
- Whoa!

513
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,500
That cut
looks infected.

514
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Yeah, I better take a look
at that- come on.

515
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,200
Sorry, bro,
but you got

516
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
a lot of dirt in there.

517
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,100
Ow.

518
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,700
So...

519
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,800
how do you know Sarah?

520
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
She's my ex.

521
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
Based on all the
flowers you sent,

522
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,100
I'd say you still had
feelings for her.

523
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
It's complicated.

524
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,300
I know.

525
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,900
She's dating my soon-to-be
brother-in-law, Chuck.

526
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,600
I didn't know.

527
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,200
Sarah said she wanted
to tell me something,

528
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
but then she got hurt.

529
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,500
Ouch.

530
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,900
Cut's pretty
deep there.

531
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,500
So, um, Chuck and Sarah...

532
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,300
is it serious?

533
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,400
I'm specializing in
cardiothoracic medicine.

534
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
That means there's one thing
in the world I know best:

535
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
the human heart.

536
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,400
I've spent enough
time with them

537
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
to see how they
are together,

538
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
see how she
looks at him.

539
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,600
My professional opinion?

540
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
She's in love with Chuck, dude.

541
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,600
You look terrible.

542
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,400
Did you guys actually sleep
at the Buy More last night,

543
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
- so you could avoid Mitt?
- What? No.

544
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,400
- Of course not. 
- Please, I'm not afraid of that miscreant.

545
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,500
And if he were here,
we'd tell him.

546
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,600
Jeff, put
that away.

547
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,300
<i>No way! This is
like Faces of Death</i>

548
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,500
all over again-
I'm gonna make a fortune.

549
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,400
No, no.
You want to do this?

550
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,300
Let's do this.

551
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,500
- Let's do this.
- Yes.

552
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,300
You guys didn't
show up last night.

553
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,500
I felt like a girl that
got stood up on prom night.

554
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,600
What's wrong?
Don't you want to dance

555
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,400
with me, bearded little man?

556
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,100
Um...

557
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,300
Hey, do you think that maybe

558
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
we could work this
out together?

559
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,800
You know, man to man
kind of thing?

560
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,700
???

561
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,100
We?

562
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,200
We.

563
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,700
All right, uh, you know, I...
yes, I'll just have

564
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,500
to take two weeks'
advance pay, but yeah, fine.

565
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,100
Okay, you got a deal.

566
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,000
That's right!

567
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,800
And don't ever
come back!

568
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,000
Wow, how'd
you do that?

569
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
You just gotta learn
to speak their language.

570
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,800
You bully a bully.

571
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,800
Yeah.

572
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,300
Chuck.

573
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,200
You... wow.

574
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
You really ought
to think

575
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
about toning down
the entrances a notch.

576
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,900
Sorry, comes
with the job.

577
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,000
Uh, look, I've...
I've already

578
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,800
had a pretty long day,
and I gotta get to work,

579
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,700
so if you have
any life-changing bombs

580
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
that you'd like
to drop on me,

581
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,200
could you please
save them for later?

582
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm worried
about Sarah.

583
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
There's nothing
to be worried about.

584
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
She got a
minor concussion

585
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,500
and a few bruises-
she'll be fine.

586
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,000
No, that's not what
I'm worried about.

587
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,600
She went off mission.

588
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
And not only
did we lose

589
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,900
the microchip and
the FULCRUM agent,

590
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,200
the two of you
almost got killed.

591
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,900
Okay, she went off mission
to protect me,

592
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,000
which by the way, is her job
and wins her points in my book.

593
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,100
<i>Sarah has feelings
for you, Chuck.</i>

594
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
Feelings that will
get her killed.

595
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
People we deal with

596
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,800
are cold-blooded assassins.

597
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,100
They have no emotions,

598
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,200
no feelings.

599
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,100
The only chance we have
against FULCRUM

600
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,400
is to think and act
like they do.

601
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,100
Anything less gets us killed.

602
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,800
Sarah knows
what she's doing, Bryce.

603
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Sarah Walker's room.

604
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,800
Oh, room 808.

605
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,900
Chuck.

606
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,700
Just the guy I
was looking for.

607
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
These are for you.

608
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Wow, Devon.

609
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,000
Thanks, I've never
received flowers

610
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,200
from another man
before, but I suppose

611
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,500
there's a first time
for everything.

612
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
They're not from me, Chuck.

613
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,400
That's a relief.

614
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
They're from Sarah's ex.

615
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
I intercepted them

616
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,000
before they got to her room.

617
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
This guy won't take no
for an answer

618
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,800
Indeed.

619
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,800
Thanks for looking out.

620
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,200
Hey, that's what bros are for.

621
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,200
Right.

622
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000


623
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,700
Bryce.

624
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Hello?

625
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,400
Yeah, you know what, Bryce,

626
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
I almost bought
your little speech, but...

627
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,400
Who's Bryce?

628
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,900
Von Hayes... Von Hayes,
we've been looking for you.

629
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,000
Who is this?

630
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Chor... Jorge.

631
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,500
Jorge Carmichael.

632
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,200
Uh, who?

633
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,900
The waiter, the
waiter who, uh,

634
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,600
who dropped that bottle
of Lafite Rothschild.

635
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,900
How did you get my number?

636
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,700
I- I sent the flowers
to that female agent.

637
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,100
Yeah, yeah, well, uh, you know,

638
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,300
I'm her supervisor,

639
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,400
and your little case has made
its way up the food chain,

640
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
so you're gonna be
dealing with me now.

641
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,800
If you want to stay alive,

642
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,100
you need to tell me
where that microchip is.

643
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,900
Don't worry.

644
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,700
I have it, it's safe, just...

645
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,200
Just don't let those people
catch me, okay?

646
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
Just get me the hell
out of here, Jorge.

647
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm-I'm-I'm living
in a Lamborghini.

648
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
You-you can't imagine
how little legroom there is.

649
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,200
All right, I know
you're pissed off

650
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,400
that I screwed up
your perfect plans,

651
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,200
but I have some good news.

652
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,800
I found the microchip.

653
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,200
How?
Doesn't matter how.

654
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,800
The point is I did it.

655
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
What exactly did you do,
Bartowski?

656
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,400
I negotiated the return
of said microchip.

657
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,700
Of course, I did have to agree
to certain terms.

658
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,800
What terms?

659
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, one,he'll only make the exchange
with me.

660
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,200
Uh, two, he wants full immunity

661
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,000
from any government prosecution.

662
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,400
I can live with that.

663
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,100
There's one...
there... well, just...

664
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
Sorry, there is
kind of just

665
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
one more little
bitty thing.

666
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,500
What? We're gonna need roughly

667
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,600
$4.5 million in unmarked bills,

668
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
preferably small denominations.

669
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Oh, how am I doing?

670
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,100
Great.

671
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,400
Looks like we'll release
you in a few hours.

672
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,700
Oh, great.

673
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,900
Don't worry.

674
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
This won't
hurt a bit.

675
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Well, unfortunately,

676
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,500
I can't promise the same.

677
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,300
What?

678
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I don't like FULCRUM,

679
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
so I'm only gonna ask once.

680
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,500
Where's your boss?

681
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Okay, here he is, Chuck.

682
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,200
You're on.

683
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Have you got the cash?

684
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,300
Yeah, I have...

685
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
I have... it's in...
it's right here in the bag.

686
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,500
Do you have the microchip?

687
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,500
All right, give me the cash. You first.

688
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,200
No, you first. I'm pretty
positive you go first.

689
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,900
Just make the exchange, moron.

690
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,200
I've never done a
handoff before.

691
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,100
I'm really not used
to this spy stuff.

692
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,200
It's a little stressful,
isn't it?

693
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

694
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
Okay, I got an idea. Oh, yeah?

695
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
????

696
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,500
I'm gonna count to three.
You're gonna count to three?

697
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,300
Or if you want... to count to three?
No, no, it's too much pressure.

698
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,100
You count to three, I'll...
So, I'm gonna count to three.

699
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
On three or after
three? What do you want?

700
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,000
We'll do after three,

701
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,200
so it's like one,
two, three, change.

702
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,400
Okay, here we go: one...

703
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
two...

704
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,100
Trouble, Chuck.
Make the exchange.

705
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,700
You told me I
could trust you.

706
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,100
No. No, no, no, wait!

707
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,200
Wait! No!

708
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,300
I can never get a break.

709
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,700
You stay here this time.

710
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,300
Hey...

711
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,700
Don't you need this?

712
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
Give us the chip, Mr. Hayes.

713
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
Don't move! Drop your weapons!

714
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
Sorry, fellas.

715
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,500
Someone's paid us
a lot of money

716
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,900
to take that chip.

717
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,300
Hold on. Wait!
Don't do anything.

718
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,400
No shooting.

719
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,400
Excuse me, gentlemen.

720
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
May I have your attention,
please?

721
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,100
Um...

722
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,000
In my hands...

723
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,900
...I'm holding $4.5 million
in unmarked bills.

724
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Now, I'm not sure
what the current

725
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,100
going rate
for thug-for-hire work is,

726
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,200
but I'm feeling
pretty confident

727
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,500
that it's a lot less
than this.

728
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,200
Now, all I ask is
that you let

729
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,700
Von Hayes
and my two friends here go,

730
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,500
and the money's
all yours.

731
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,500
Or you can

732
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,100
die horrible deaths
in a hail of gunfire.

733
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,000
The choice is yours, really.

734
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,700
That was amazing!

735
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,400
Thank you, Jorge.
No, don't mention it.

736
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,200
All right.

737
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,300
No, no, no-
don't encourage him.

738
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,800
You know, a little appreciation
wouldn't kill you.

739
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,200
I mean, I did get the microchip back.

740
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
You also gave away $4.5 million

741
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,800
in taxpayer money.
Nobody's perfect.

742
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Where are you going?

743
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,800
To get it back, idiot.

744
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
You know, I don't need Casey
to tell me I'm a good spy.

745
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,600
I think I'm doing fine.
The fact of the matter is

746
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,700
I mean, it's really not as hard
as it's cracked up to be anyway.

747
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,800
Okay, let's
try this one more time.

748
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
The microchip.

749
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,400
The microchip, now.
Release the kid first.

750
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,700
"Kid"? Honestly, we're born
in the same year.

751
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,600
Give me the chip
and I'll let him go.

752
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Promise.

753
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,600
Chip?

754
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,100
There. Now release him.

755
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Sorry.

756
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
Got it?

757
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,500
Yeah, I got it.

758
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Take it.

759
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,200
Take the shot, Sarah!

760
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,700
Sarah, take the shot!

761
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,200
Take it!

762
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,500
Oh!

763
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, you want
something done right...

764
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,000
you do it yourself.

765
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,300
Morgan, you said you
got rid of them.

766
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,000
End him, Morgan.

767
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,600
My friend, please.

768
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,900
Please fix this.

769
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,700
Man, get off!
Come on! Get him! Get him!

770
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,200
You're gonna buy me...

771
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,900
Uh, Mr. Mitt, sir.

772
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,100
Hey, uh, we had
an understanding before.

773
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,900
We did, before.

774
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,300
Now we need a PlayStation 3.

775
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,300
I'm broke, man.

776
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
Well, if that's the case,

777
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,300
scram, you little loser.

778
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,000
You can't talk to him like that.

779
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,500
Piss off, Yoko.

780
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,200
You can't talk to me like that.

781
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,300
Right, Morgan?

782
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
I don't hear anything.

783
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,600
You guys hear anything?

784
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, did you hear that?

785
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,400
Sweep the leg, Morgan.

786
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
Sweep the leg.

787
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,200
Just so you know,

788
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,500
I think my fist is bigger
than your entire head.

789
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,700
Lay off him, meatheads.

790
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,800
Anna, what are you doing?

791
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
Saving you, babe.

792
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,700
Um... I don't really
think that that's...

793
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,400
Hey, I don't fight girls.

794
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,500
Neither do I.

795
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,100
Oh!

796
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
Can I get a background clearance
on a one Anna Wu?

797
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,400
Nice shot, Miss Wu.

798
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,400
I have a candidate
for possible field work.

799
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,700
No.

800
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,200
Chuck.

801
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,800
What did I say
about the entrances?

802
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,500
We need to talk
about Sarah.

803
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
She had a chance
to take the shot

804
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,700
back there
and she didn't.

805
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,000
She hesitated
and almost cost us

806
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,800
the microchip and your life.

807
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,700
I know.

808
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,500
What are you
going to do about it?

809
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,300
I don't know, Bryce.

810
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,200
You tell me.
What am I supposed to do?

811
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,500
You'll do the right thing.

812
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
You always do.

813
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,100
That why I sent you
the Intersect in the first place.

814
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,700
Hey, uh, Bryce...

815
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,500
Forgot your glasses.

816
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,000
You keep 'em.

817
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
If you're going to be
a real spy,

818
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
you're gonna need them.

819
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,600
I don't...
I don't want to be a real spy.

820
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,500
From what I've seen, it's a little too late
for that, Chuck.

821
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm sure you
hate me right now.

822
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,600
But someday you're gonna realize
I was looking out for you.

823
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,300
I had been all along.

824
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,800
I know I hesitated.

825
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,100
I let my guard down momentarily
and it was a mistake.

826
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
But I can protect Chuck.

827
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,100
Hand me that chammy, will you?

828
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Hey.
Hey.

829
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
Everything okay?

830
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,400
Yeah, yeah.

831
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,600
Just, there's, um...

832
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
I just had a
couple of things

833
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,300
I wanted to tell you
before dinner. Yeah.

834
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,400
Me, too. Look...
Look...

835
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,700
I'm sorry.

836
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,900
Look, we
both know

837
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,400
how I feel about you,
so I'm just gonna shoot

838
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
straight.

839
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Sarah, you're the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

840
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,700
You're beautiful,
you're smart,

841
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,200
you laugh at all
of my stupid jokes,

842
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,300
and you have this horrible habit
of constantly saving my life.

843
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,500
The truth is, you're everything

844
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,400
that I thought
I ever wanted and more.

845
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,300
The last few days,
all I can think about

846
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,700
is our future together,

847
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,000
about what it's gonna be like

848
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,700
once I finally get the Intersect
out of my head,

849
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,800
how we'll finally
be together for real-

850
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
no fake relationships...

851
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
no covers, no lies.

852
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,600
But the more I think about it,
the more I realize

853
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,600
that you and I can never
have a future together.

854
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,300
I fooled myself into thinking
that we could, but the truth is

855
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,900
we can't.

856
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,900
Because even if we had
a real relationship,

857
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,400
it would never really be real.

858
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,800
I'd still never know
anything about you-

859
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,000
your real name,
your hometown,

860
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
your first love,
anything.

861
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,400
And I want more than that.

862
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
I want to be able to call you
at the end of a bad day

863
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,100
and tell you about some
funny thing that Morgan did

864
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,300
and not find out that I can't
because you're off...

865
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,000
somewhere in Paraguay,

866
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
quelling a revolution
with a fork.

867
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,600
I'm a normal guy...

868
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,800
who wants a normal life.

869
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,500
And as amazing as you
are, Sarah Walker,

870
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,700
we both know that...

871
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,000
you will never be normal.

872
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,400
You know, someday, when the
Intersect is out of your head

873
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,100
and you have the life
that you always wanted,

874
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,800
you'll forget all about me.

875
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,200
I seriously doubt that.

876
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,800
Come on, we better get inside.

877
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,100
They're waiting for us.

878
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,800
Hey.

879
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,300
It's our favorite bridesmaid.

880
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,400
I'm so excited!

881
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,300
Wait till you see
the dresses that I picked out.

882
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,000
Hey, buddy.

883
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Glad to see you guys
worked things out.

884
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Who knows,
maybe you're next, huh?

885
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,000
Not bad.

886
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,100
Carmichael.

887
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Charles Carmichael.

888
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
4

889
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I hate Bryce Larkin.
