1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,432
Hey, I’m Chuck. here's a few things that you
might need to know or maybe you just forgot.

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,378
There's only one piece
left to clean up.

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,275
Perry. Chuck has to kill him.

4
00:00:07,276 --> 00:00:09,187
You are giving him
his red test tonight?

5
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,268
<i>You kidding me?
Kill him here, now?</i>

6
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:12,336
<i>I can't do that.</i>

7
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:14,237
Then you won't become a spy.

8
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:19,187
You passed the test.
To them you killed Perry.

9
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:22,008
No one can know the truth
ever. Not even Sarah.

10
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:23,839
You're now officially an agent.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,549
Included there's a plain ticket to
Washington, you'll leave tonight.

12
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:34,810
<i>CHUCK:
First day. Don't be nervous.
Don't be nervous.</i>

13
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:45,788
What floor? Five.

14
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:47,890
No, not five.

15
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,897
Oh, hey, uh, I'm so
sorry to bother you.

16
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:56,966
You wouldn't happen to know what
Floor General Beckman is on?

17
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:58,634
They told me at the front desk

18
00:00:58,635 --> 00:00:59,969
and I-I just totally forgot.

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,537
You couldn't miss her.
She's real little,

20
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:02,571
lots of medals, red hair.

21
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:03,706
Nice, nice, friendly conversation.

22
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,474
That's good. I'm glad we did that.

23
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:07,375
No!

24
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,954
Sir?

25
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:20,589
Excuse me, sir.

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,258
This is a restricted floor.

27
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,727
I need a badge and a signature.

28
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:29,765
Sir, I can't let you examine a body

29
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,335
without an authorized NSA badge.

30
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:35,171
Would you do me a favor?

31
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:37,239
Just... one step.

32
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:39,809
There, perfect.

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,577
What do you think you're doing?!

34
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,509
It's done.

35
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:15,644
Package is intact.

36
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,613
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

37
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,950
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

38
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,885
Thank you for waiting.

39
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:26,088
Here we are. Thank God.

40
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:27,690
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

41
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,991
How's it going?

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,627
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

43
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:33,929
Super.

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,198
Thank you for waiting.

45
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,200
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

46
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:39,535
Yes, I'll put you right through.

47
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:41,003
Excuse me. Hi, my name's...

48
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:42,404
Have a seat, Agent Bartowski.

49
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:44,073
The General knows you're here.

50
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:45,808
NSA.

51
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:50,980
Right. Yeah, of course
she knows I'm here.

52
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,516
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

53
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,318
Oh, God, these things are

54
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,319
incredibly uncomfortable.

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,354
Is there a particular place

56
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,455
that you like to put this?

57
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,389
'Cause I'm always having...

58
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,191
Oh, right, yes.

59
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:04,894
Sorry about...
Finger always on the slide,

60
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,862
and you know, totally empty so...

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,464
But I hear you. Safety first.

62
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:10,699
A pleasure as always, General.

63
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:13,335
The pleasure's all mine, Diane.

64
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,137
Mr. Bartowski.
Oh!

65
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:16,906
For God's sake,

66
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,575
put that gun away.
You're a spy now.

67
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,510
Well, that's, that's
actually what I wanted

68
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,279
to talk to you about, General.

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,647
Your first assignment
just arrived.

70
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:26,982
The CIA wants you
in Rome right away.

71
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,018
Uh, what?
Excuse me, right away?

72
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,719
Mm-hmm.
You will be posing

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,688
as a independently wealthy
young expatriate.

74
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,990
That way, your jet-setting lifestyle

75
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,326
and influential associates
won't draw attention.

76
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:39,995
Here is where you'll be staying.

77
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:42,364
Uh, wow.

78
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,632
Obviously, you will be afforded

79
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,100
all the accoutrements
that go with it:

80
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,436
cars, clothes, a yearly stipend.

81
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,238
Huh? What? Yearly?

82
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,707
Yearly stipend?

83
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:54,510
This is all moving very, very
fast, don't you think?

84
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:57,613
The NSA has spent three years

85
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:59,215
and countless millions of dollars

86
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,616
helping you reach
your potential.

87
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,418
There's nothing fast about it.

88
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:03,686
I get that. I do.

89
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,287
I do, General, and
I certainly don't

90
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,388
want to come across

91
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,923
as being ungrateful
for the, the villa

92
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:09,892
or the car or the stipend.

93
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,962
I'm just not sure
that I am really ready

94
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,929
to pack up and move
somewhere to live

95
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,266
this whole new life

96
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,368
when I'm just starting
to become comfortable

97
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:23,138
with the life I'm living...
right now, you know?

98
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:25,241
What exactly did you think

99
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:29,211
we were training you for,
Mr. Bartowski?

100
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,250
I don't... I don't really know
what to say, General.

101
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:35,884
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,785
Is not an option!

103
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:47,096
I understand that
the hand-wringing

104
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:51,500
and the second-guessing
are all part of your process.

105
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:54,003
Here's what I'm offering:

106
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,673
take the week off,
anywhere you want, on us.

107
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:59,975
But afterwards, I expect

108
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,845
you back in Washington and
ready to assemble your team.

109
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:03,912
Is that understood?

110
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:06,815
Hang on. Um, back up a second.

111
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:08,784
What do you mean by

112
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,819
"my" team?

113
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:13,589
You didn't think we were going
to send you to Rome alone?

114
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:16,492
You'll have your pick
of our top agents,

115
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,094
whoever you want.

116
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:21,563
So where will we be sending you,
Mr. Bartowski?

117
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:22,931
Bali? Bora Bora?

118
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:24,832
Burbank.

119
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,503
Bob Hope Airport, to be exact.

120
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,471
I see.

121
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,207
And will you be requiring
a companion ticket?

122
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,175
No, thanks.

123
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,480
She's still there.

124
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:43,819
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

125
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:22,944
That's, uh, that's
fantastic news. Okay.

126
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,912
Thank you.

127
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:31,886
Enough of the suspense, babe.

128
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:34,255
One word, Devon: Africa.

129
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:35,657
Africa?

130
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:36,891
That was the hospital.

131
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,159
I didn't even have to ask.

132
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,828
Out of the blue, they just offered me

133
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,030
a sabbatical. I have a year off.

134
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,965
Do you know what that means?

135
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,167
Africa.

136
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,169
We can do Doctors without Borders,

137
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:49,270
follow our dreams,

138
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:50,271
whatever you want.

139
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:51,806
What about Chuck?

140
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,475
Chuck is moving on, you know?

141
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,376
I really believe that this time.

142
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:57,145
He said he was on a business trip

143
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:58,379
for Buy More in Washington.

144
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,014
Yeah, yeah, he did
Sound pretty pumped

145
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,082
when I talked to him.

146
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,950
Who knows where

147
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,851
he'll end up. Who knows?

148
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,153
Honey, there's nothing
keeping us here.

149
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,798
Africa.

150
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,833
I've never had to win
a girl back, buddy,

151
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:21,402
so I stopped by the store
on the way here.

152
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,171
I got Sarah a bunch of stuff.

153
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:25,240
What do you think? Am I overdoing it?
Hmm-mmm.

154
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:28,143
You think I'm overdoing it.
I'm overdoing it.

155
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,679
Well, the chocolates
are a nice touch, I guess,

156
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:33,381
to buy her back,

157
00:07:33,382 --> 00:07:34,449
if that makes any sense.

158
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,251
I know, I know, you're right.

159
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:38,520
It just finally clicked
for me, you know?

160
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:39,988
Sarah is, is the most
important thing.

161
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,589
I mean, what's the point
of being a spy without her?

162
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,158
I've got to win her back,

163
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,393
and I've only got a small window
of opportunity to do it in

164
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:47,162
before I have to leave for Rome.

165
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:52,167
Hey. Did you just say
you're gonna go to Rome?

166
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:53,768
Yeah, my new assignment
starts there next week.

167
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,870
Then you are still leaving.
Thank God!

168
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:57,205
I just fed Ellie some story

169
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,606
about you working for
Buy More corporate.

170
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,108
She won't go to Africa
if you're still here.

171
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:01,843
Well, I'm not going anywhere
without Sarah.

172
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,511
Then let's get you two
kids back together.

173
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:04,979
Shouldn't be too
difficult, huh?

174
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,148
You seen the stallion
she's dating?

175
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:08,249
Casey, do you...?

176
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,019
Do, do you ever knock
or use a door?

177
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:12,687
Shaw's not some geek who likes

178
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:15,323
to talk about his feelings
all day long. He's a real spy.

179
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,225
Oh. Oh, really? Is that so?

180
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:19,928
Well, apparently, you haven't
heard because you no longer work

181
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,229
for the United States government,

182
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,032
but I'm heading up my own
undercover operation.

183
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,367
In Rome. And I get to
choose my own team.

184
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:28,970
Really? Anyone?

185
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,072
Including a civilian with
extensive military background?

186
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
Take a number, Casey.

187
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,741
Chuck, I speak fluent Italian.

188
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:35,043
Menu items mostly.

189
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:36,511
I'd be an invaluable asset.

190
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:38,646
Listen, guys, I got
to get Sarah back first.

191
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:39,914
Then we can start talking
about a team.

192
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:41,149
What are we waiting for, fellas?

193
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,383
Let's help the guy
get his girl back. Come on!

194
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:44,219
Yeah, so Ellie and I
can go to Africa.

195
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,486
And I can get out of Burbank.

196
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:46,554
I can finally go see Rome.

197
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,223
Maybe meet a nice Italian girl.

198
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:51,192
See the Vatican...
pay my respects to the Pope.

199
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,863
DEVON:
What are you waiting for,
lover boy?

200
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,834
Hey, um...

201
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:00,902
You're back.

202
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:01,936
I've been calling you

203
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,504
for, for a couple days now.

204
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:05,607
You know, there's a lot
we need to talk about.

205
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:08,443
I know. I'm sorry.

206
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,544
It's been a little...

207
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:10,645
Crazy. Yeah, I know.

208
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:12,513
Beckman flew me to D.C.

209
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:14,414
I got my badge.
It's official now.

210
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,416
I'm an agent.

211
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,385
Congratulations. You earned it.

212
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,787
You know the CIA--
they're sending me to Italy.

213
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:22,290
You wouldn't believe the villa
that they're putting me up in.

214
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm supposed to be
some rich young playboy.

215
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:26,995
But who cares about that?

216
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,496
The point is, Sarah...

217
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:30,798
I want you to go with me.

218
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,101
Chuck, I can't.

219
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:35,303
No, Beckman said I get
to choose my own team,

220
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:36,804
cream of the crop. That's you.

221
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,705
I'm going to Washington, okay?
And I'm going with Shaw.

222
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:40,875
Wait a minute.

223
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:43,177
Wasn't this the plan?

224
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:44,445
There's nothing stopping us

225
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:45,613
from being together now.

226
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:46,981
I passed my spy test.

227
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:48,850
That's why I can't
be with you, okay?

228
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,351
You're not... you're not the same guy

229
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:51,486
that I fell for.

230
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,254
How? Why? Because I'm an agent now?

231
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,889
How am I not the same guy?

232
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,358
You killed somebody, Chuck.
I saw you kill the mole!

233
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:09,003
Sarah, I know what you think
you saw on the train tracks,

234
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:11,205
but it's not that simple.

235
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:12,807
It's more complicated than that.

236
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:16,811
and I need you to believe me.

237
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,280
I don't.

238
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:23,184
I hope I'm not interrupting.

239
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:27,855
Congratulations on your promotion,

240
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:30,458
Special Agent Bartowski.

241
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:33,194
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Yeah, it's, uh...

242
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,029
it's very exciting.

243
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,198
So what brings you
back to Burbank?

244
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:41,536
Um... I, uh,

245
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,304
you know, just, uh,

246
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:45,006
just-just tying up
a few loose ends.

247
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,507
Actually, Chuck was
just wondering

248
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:48,710
if I had any last-minute advice

249
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:50,677
on his new assignment in Rome.

250
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,780
Well, you shouldn't
have come to her.

251
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:56,884
You should have come to me.

252
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:58,586
I was stationed there
for two years.

253
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:00,822
Come on. I can tell you
everything you need to know.

254
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,789
Oh, great.

255
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:16,004
Hey.

256
00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:18,006
How'd it go with Walker?

257
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,374
Because she thinks
I killed the mole,

258
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,442
she believes I'm no longer
the guy she fell in love with.

259
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,744
I have to tell her the truth.

260
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,512
What? That I killed him?
Not gonna happen.

261
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:26,413
Casey, you said it yourself.
The guy was a traitor.

262
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,383
Yeah, well, according
to Beckman, so am I.

263
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,284
I'm lucky she didn't
put a bullet in my head.

264
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:31,853
Get her back some other way.

265
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,121
Well, what the heck am I
supposed to tell Sarah?

266
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:35,456
Tell her whatever you want,
just not the truth.

267
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:37,425
You like being a full-fledged
spy, don't you?

268
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:40,728
You like that nice villa the CIA
picked out for you in Rome, hmm?

269
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:43,531
Then you killed the mole.
That's how it's got to be.

270
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,266
MORGAN:
Okay, okay.

271
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,634
How did it go? How did it go?

272
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:47,668
Crashed and burned.

273
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:48,836
Chuck, did you tell
her how you feel?

274
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,671
Forget it.

275
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,572
She's leaving with Shaw
in the morning.

276
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:53,841
CHUCK:
I'm sorry, guys. It's over.

277
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,510
I'm going to get some fresh air,

278
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,812
and figure out how I'm going
to tell Beckman I'm quitting.

279
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:03,184
There goes our chance to ever
get out of the Buy More.

280
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:06,154
Really? Is that what they
teach you in the Marine Corps?

281
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:07,221
Hmm?

282
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:08,289
Roll over and die?

283
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,857
This isn't exactly combat,
Morgan.

284
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,526
That's where you're wrong,
Casey.

285
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:15,163
Because love?
Love is a battlefield.

286
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:19,801
Huh.

287
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:20,668
Hey, fellas.

288
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,070
Need your help.

289
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:24,105
Actually, Chuck needs your help.

290
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:25,640
Went and lost his
old lady again, huh?

291
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:26,641
Yeah. How did
you know that?

292
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:27,675
We know everything.

293
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:28,876
The eyes and the ears

294
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:30,478
of the strip mall, my friend.

295
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:33,347
Chuck better move quick if he
wants to get his froyo ho back.

296
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:35,917
Another fella sniffing
around the orange.

297
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:37,752
Orange.

298
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,254
Guy knows how to fill out
a pair of slacks.

299
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:41,389
If you know what I'm saying.

300
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,490
No, I don't.

301
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,524
I didn't notice that.

302
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,693
You want us to put a tail

303
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:46,861
on blondie's new piece?

304
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,262
Find out his weaknesses,

305
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:49,730
see what skeletons
are in his closet?

306
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:51,032
Blood sample, urine?

307
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,200
Stool?

308
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,268
No.

309
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:55,503
No, not at... I just...

310
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:57,872
I just need to borrow something.

311
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,183
Whoa! Whoa!

312
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,185
What the crap is going on?

313
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:12,920
You guys scared the
bejeezus out of me.

314
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,455
We're here to help you
reacquire Agent Walker.

315
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:16,657
Guys, listen. You don't understand.

316
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:18,659
No, Chuck, you don't understand.

317
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:20,528
You're not the only one with
something at stake here, Chuck.

318
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,497
Yeah, we help you
get the girl back,

319
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,198
you help us get out of Burbank.

320
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,600
Think of it as a test run for Rome.

321
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,868
MORGAN:
What do you think, boss?

322
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,804
Hey, get dressed.
Reservation's in ten minutes.

323
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,272
Reservation for what? Come on.

324
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:33,040
CHUCK:
Guys. Is this Jeff's van?

325
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,041
CASEY:
Go, go, go!

326
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,942
(tires screeching)

327
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:41,481
Darn, he's on the move.

328
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:44,118
Guys, what are we doing here?

329
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,386
It's Shaw's date.

330
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:47,522
MORGAN:
Wow. That guy can fill out
a pair of slacks.

331
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,525
Sarah's with a stallion. Huh.

332
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:51,826
Don't listen to him, Chuck.

333
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,161
We have a plan.

334
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:54,228
You've got nothing
to worry about, man.

335
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:57,064
MAN:
Target is in position, sir.

336
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:02,270
Looks like a romantic dinner.

337
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:04,438
Sorry, Shaw.

338
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:10,267
1990 Chateau Latour.
Excellent choice.

339
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:11,335
SHAW:
Thank you.

340
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:13,804
Knowledge of fine wine.
Very classy.

341
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:16,307
He just ordered for both of them.

342
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:17,808
That's a power move, bro.

343
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:19,443
Yeah. Guy's a closer.

344
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,778
Guys, guys.

345
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,781
A little sensitivity would
really go a long way.

346
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:26,383
Just a smidgeon. A skosh. A dab.

347
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:27,718
We're talking about

348
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,619
the girl I love here.

349
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:34,158
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,559
What could you possibly
be sorry for?

351
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,794
This is amazing.

352
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,128
It's just...

353
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,297
I'm sorry that we haven't
done this sooner.

354
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,132
This is nice.

355
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,033
No, it's perfect.

356
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:46,070
Being here with you.

357
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,840
SHAW:
To a new life and a fresh start.

358
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:52,242
No Burbank, no baggage.

359
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,044
All right, this isn't good.

360
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,913
Why doesn't John here
just drag him out of there?

361
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:59,450
I'm afraid my days of legalized
body snatching are over, guys.

362
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:00,718
I'm a civilian now.

363
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,653
This one's on you, Bartowski.

364
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:04,555
All right, Chuck. Whatever you
do, do not go in there too hot.

365
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:05,589
You will scare her away.

366
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,124
Negative. Okay?

367
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,726
Chuck has to lay it all
on the line.

368
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:09,893
Shaw, he may be
handsome and worldly

369
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:10,994
and know his way around a menu,

370
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,895
but, man, he's stiff as a board.

371
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:14,398
Where's that Bartowski charm?

372
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,266
The pizzazz? You flash a smile,

373
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,634
you go in there and you...

374
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:19,269
Morgan, why don't you
let me handle it? Okay?

375
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,238
No offense, but I've had
my fair share of ladies.

376
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,573
'Cause you live in a bubble.

377
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:23,907
Okay? Take a look at yourself.

378
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:24,975
Go ahead.

379
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:27,211
It's a freakish bubble
of handsomeness.

380
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,912
Now, look at me.

381
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:30,180
No bubble. No bubble.

382
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,181
I got to be completely verbal.

383
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,416
Now, Chuck, I'm telling you,

384
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,251
you just go in and you
be fun and you be witty,

385
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:35,619
and you be the charming
guy she fell for.

386
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Yeah?

387
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,288
Okay. Okay, fine.

388
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:39,456
But what about Shaw?

389
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:41,357
Just worry about the girl.

390
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:44,261
I'll take care of the stallion.

391
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:56,039
Sorry to disturb you, but,
Mr. Shaw, you have a phone call.

392
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,881
Target's on the move.

393
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,285
DEEP VOICE (on phone):
Agent Shaw.

394
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:10,154
I'm an operative of The Ring.

395
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:11,822
If you want to save everyone

396
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:13,724
in this restaurant,
you will listen

397
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,526
to my instructions very carefully.

398
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,628
(deep voice):
You will do everything that I say.

399
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,834
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

400
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:26,470
Exit the restaurant. Side door.

401
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,438
And head to the back alley.

402
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:33,177
We've lost visual on the target.

403
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:36,313
Bring up the phone dub.

404
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,549
DEEP VOICE (on speaker):
Stay cool and nobody will get hurt.

405
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:40,617
Who the hell is that?

406
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,294
Is this seat taken?

407
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,596
Chuck, what are you doing here?

408
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,735
I'm here for you.

409
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:00,604
What do you want me to say?

410
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,173
I want you to say that
you'll come with me to Rome.

411
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,141
Well, you know that I can't,
and you know why.

412
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:08,412
Look, Sarah, I don't want
to have to make a scene

413
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,947
in front of all these
very nice people, but I will

414
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:11,281
literally do anything
to change your mind.

415
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,317
Well, then tell me what really
happened at the train tracks.

416
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:15,752
SARAH: If you didn't kill
the mole, then who did?

417
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,323
Look, I don't want there
to be any secrets

418
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,724
or lies between us, ever again.

419
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:23,360
So, please, let me
just have this one.

420
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:27,231
And I promise I will
never lie to you.

421
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,168
There you will head
to a pay phone.

422
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:33,604
The southwest corner. Do it.

423
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:36,273
But do it slowly.

424
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:37,908
DEEP VOICE (over speakers):
Slowly.

425
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:40,577
Not one of ours.

426
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,380
Take him down.

427
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,750
We know exactly what
you look like, Shaw.

428
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:50,754
6'2", 220, black hair,

429
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:52,722
very attractive.

430
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:59,429
Next move, you're to wait
for a phone call.

431
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:02,132
Might not happen right away.

432
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,735
So be patient.
And then, when you...

433
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:07,638
Do you have any idea
who these people are?

434
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:08,672
What they're capable of?

435
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:09,873
Mm-mmm. Nope?

436
00:18:09,874 --> 00:18:11,275
Listen.

437
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:14,745
I know that you think
I'm not that same guy

438
00:18:14,812 --> 00:18:16,280
that you met the first
day at the Buy More.

439
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:18,582
And you know what? You're right.

440
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,850
Okay? You're right.

441
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:21,685
The guy that I was back
Then hated himself

442
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,453
for not knowing what he wanted
to do with the rest of his life

443
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:25,556
or who he wanted to
spend it with, but now?

444
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,760
Finally, now... I know.

445
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:33,697
I want to be a spy.

446
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,665
And I want to be with you.

447
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,469
MORGAN:
Hey, it's just a harmless prank.

448
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,305
Listen, you have to understand...

449
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:42,706
Who are they?

450
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:43,840
Is that a taser?

451
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,375
Sorry about this.
Oh, boy.

452
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:58,589
Sarah.

453
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,990
Man down.

454
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:00,991
I've been tased.

455
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:02,559
I can't feel my legs.

456
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,460
Bring a stretcher, a wheelbarrow.

457
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,430
Possible change of pants.

458
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,600
Casey, you got to do something.

459
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,201
He's gunning for Chuck.

460
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:12,703
I'm a civilian now. I can't.

461
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:14,938
Well, I can.

462
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:17,673
Daniel.

463
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:21,778
If you're going to
shoot me, just do it.

464
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:22,846
Put a bullet in my head.

465
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,548
Bullet?

466
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,883
The director wants to meet
with you face to face.

467
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,785
What are you saying?

468
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:31,922
Sarah, I'm saying... that I...

469
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:46,203
Next time, take out
the guy with the gun.

470
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,020
Jail? Seriously, you guys? Jail?

471
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,188
I mean, Morgan,

472
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,590
I would have expected
This from you.

473
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,625
Or even from Casey,

474
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:57,993
now that we have all been privy

475
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:59,194
to your public indecency problem.

476
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:02,297
<i>But, Devon, I never
expected this from you.</i>

477
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:03,832
No, babe. I am so sorry.

478
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,367
You know what?

479
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:06,368
Just save the apology. Okay?

480
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,770
I want answers.

481
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:10,139
I want the truth. I want you
guys to tell me everything.

482
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,707
The truth?

483
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,608
Yes.

484
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:16,411
The truth is...

485
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:17,646
We were, uh, helping Chuck.

486
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,047
Chuck is in D.C., Casey.

487
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:22,751
Well, he was. He's back
to win back Sarah, so...

488
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,353
Hold on for a minute.

489
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:27,289
You guys expect me to believe
that the three of you

490
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:29,625
got my husband beat up
and tossed in jail

491
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,560
to save my brother's love life?

492
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:32,995
Yes. Yes, we did.

493
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:34,229
We're as shocked as you are.

494
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,631
And, what's more,

495
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:38,801
Chuck came to you
Three for advice.

496
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:40,002
Before me.

497
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:41,570
Yeah. Yes, he did.

498
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,038
Why am I not surprised
this ended in jail?

499
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,508
Agent Shaw, we have
just received intel

500
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,410
that the Ring agent
who tried to capture you

501
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:50,445
is the same man who
removed a data drive

502
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:52,147
from inside the mole's body.

503
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:54,016
The data was inside him?

504
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:56,018
He was in the process of
digesting it when he was killed.

505
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,020
I'll spare you the gory details.

506
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,822
Lucky he was dead first.

507
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,256
We believe the stolen data drive

508
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,192
contains highly sensitive
case files.

509
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,427
Your new mission is to
bring back those files.

510
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:06,728
General, if I may,

511
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,330
it's not good enough.

512
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:09,598
Excuse me, Agent Shaw.

513
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,966
You have a better idea?

514
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,001
The Ring agent we encountered
did not want to kill me.

515
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,969
He wanted to take me
to the director.

516
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:17,472
If the Ring wants to
take me, let them.

517
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,675
You're volunteering
to be a double agent?

518
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:21,243
I'm volunteering
to be a bull's-eye.

519
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:23,612
I'll paint a target
on the Ring from within.

520
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,514
I can get close to the director
and track his location.

521
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:26,682
And then what?

522
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:27,916
It's your call, General,

523
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,817
but I'd suggest you
launch an air strike.

524
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,921
Shouldn't we stop and ask

525
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:34,790
what the Ring wants with you
in the first place?

526
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,358
And why they want you alive?

527
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,593
It doesn't matter.

528
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:40,295
We can decimate the
Ring's command structure

529
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,964
with a single mission.

530
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,365
I see the merits.

531
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,334
But you do recognize the danger?

532
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,602
General.

533
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:48,537
This is the moment
I've been waiting for...

534
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:50,505
we've been waiting for.

535
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:52,473
A singular opportunity.

536
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:54,243
Whatever the risk may be,

537
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:55,344
I say it's worth it.

538
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:56,411
Very good.

539
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:58,814
Make it work.

540
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,616
Are you trying to
get yourself killed?

541
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:02,885
You're asking if I'd trade my life

542
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:05,087
for the man who
killed my wife?

543
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:08,957
I would.

544
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:11,727
Well, what if I don't let you?

545
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:13,061
It's not your choice.

546
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:21,803
MAN:
Hello?

547
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:23,305
This is Daniel Shaw.

548
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:25,407
I believe you've
been looking for me.

549
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:27,375
I'm ready to come in.

550
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:31,612
It's done.

551
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:36,718
Ellie, hey.

552
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,453
Um, look, I can explain.

553
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:40,355
Chuck, listen to me. No. I know
Exactly what you're going to say.

554
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:41,423
And you're absolutely right.

555
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:42,424
It was completely immature of me

556
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,425
to get everyone involved like that.

557
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,826
Chuck, you're not listening.

558
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:45,894
Stupid? Maybe stupid's
the word you're looking for.

559
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:46,962
I get it. I went too far.

560
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:48,864
You didn't go far enough, Chuck.

561
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,266
Sarah is special. I know it.

562
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,302
You know it. If you love
her, if she's the one,

563
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,470
then you don't stop.
You don't quit.

564
00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:57,806
You never go too far.

565
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,276
You are a Bartowski, Chuck.

566
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,345
Start acting like one.

567
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,089
Shaw, please. You're
moving too fast.

568
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:15,524
You're not thinking
this through.

569
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,125
Hey, we're spies, Walker.

570
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:18,327
Let's start acting like it.

571
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:20,228
But you don't have to do this.

572
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,130
There's got to be another way.

573
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,633
It's the only way to be sure.

574
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,501
I have to do this.

575
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:28,402
I'm sorry.

576
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,882
Hey.

577
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:47,956
SARAH:
What's that?

578
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:50,092
It's how you'll find me.

579
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,961
This will give Beckman the
coordinates for the air strike.

580
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,434
Wow.

581
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:01,335
You just...

582
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:02,938
You just swallowed
that thing whole, huh?

583
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,940
No-No water to wash it down.

584
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:10,478
Take care of her, Chuck.

585
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:20,088
Uh...

586
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:21,356
Where is he going?

587
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:23,257
Shaw is turning himself
In to the Ring.

588
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,727
He's leading us to them.

589
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:29,398
He's sacrificing himself, Chuck.

590
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,668
Oh.

591
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:37,773
I never should have let Morgan

592
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:39,474
lay his dirty little
hands on Loretta.

593
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:41,375
She's a sweet van, my friend.

594
00:24:41,411 --> 00:24:43,278
That van's my retirement, dude.

595
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,380
And they took the van
and they left us.

596
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,215
That is a slap in the face.

597
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:48,850
It's insulting.

598
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:52,054
Do they have any idea how much
stalking experience I have?

599
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:53,288
If only they did, Jeffrey.

600
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,589
You're very prolific.

601
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,759
You're the-the
Picasso of creepiness.

602
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:01,196
It's true. And this
is my Blue period.

603
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,601
Good. There's the guy.

604
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:12,474
Blondie's new boyfriend.

605
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:14,375
We need to demonstrate our worth.

606
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:16,545
Show them that we can stalk
with the best of them.

607
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:18,246
What do you say, my friend?

608
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:21,049
Let's do the dizzle.

609
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:25,187
Shaw's going on a suicide mission?

610
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:26,555
I don't care what he says.

611
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:28,557
I am not letting him go in alone.

612
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,035
He's not going in alone.

613
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,640
Chuck, what are you doing?

614
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:46,808
Shaw needs help.

615
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:48,076
I know he does.

616
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,578
And that's why I'm going
In to bring him back.

617
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:51,079
But the air strike
is on its way.

618
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,581
You're both going to get killed.

619
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:55,250
Why are you helping him?

620
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:59,554
'Cause I know how much
you care about him.

621
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,514
Glad you could make it.

622
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,083
The director's expecting you.

623
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:29,021
Be cool.

624
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,556
You think he saw us?

625
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:32,457
Never.

626
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,060
Frisk him.

627
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,198
Stalkee is behind a gray van

628
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,334
with another male, possibly
for a sexual encounter.

629
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:44,770
Both men are physically fit.

630
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:46,005
Should be lively.

631
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,239
Jeffrey?

632
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,140
Don't make me afraid
to be alone with you.

633
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:51,644
In case you swallowed a tracker.

634
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,512
Rather err on the side of caution.

635
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,718
They're much quieter
when they're dead.

636
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:10,162
What do we have here?

637
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,198
Now we can go see the director.

638
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:40,826
This is the exact model
our federal government uses

639
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:42,794
when cleaning up hot zones.

640
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,531
Murder investigations.

641
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,375
So, does this model come
with any rebates?

642
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,981
Huh?

643
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:05,885
Morse code.

644
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:06,919
Got to run.

645
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,820
It's on the house.

646
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,104
Oh. Ugh.

647
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:27,706
Lester, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

648
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,974
I can't talk.

649
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:30,643
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no.
No worries. No worries, buddy.

650
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,011
I, too, am a little bit busy.

651
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:34,580
Uh, stalking Sarah's new
stallion, as Jeffrey would say.

652
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:35,614
You got to be kidding me.

653
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:36,548
LESTER:
Hang up the phone.

654
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,183
I've been insulted enough.

655
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,485
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no, no.

656
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,654
You guys are stalking
Sarah's new stallion?

657
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,122
Yes, on our off time,

658
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:45,424
to show you what amateurs
you're working with.

659
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:46,759
Well, can you see him right now?

660
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,394
No, we're tucked
behind a dumpster.

661
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,662
But it did look
like the Stallion

662
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:50,996
and some frat guys were heading

663
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:51,997
into a dingy warehouse
or something.

664
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:54,366
Dude is into some kinky stuff.

665
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:57,002
Okay. Listen, Lester.

666
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:59,038
I need you to tell me
where you are right now.

667
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,807
It looks like we're at the
corner of 2nd and Alvarado.

668
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,424
Hey!

669
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,059
Oh, thank you, Casey.

670
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,960
I haven't used Morse code
since basic training.

671
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,297
I use it all the time to talk
to my Marine buddies. What's up?

672
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:26,732
Okay, Shaw gave himself
up to the director,

673
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:27,900
and Chuck locked me in here

674
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,134
because he knew I would
try and rescue him

675
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,703
and Beckman's going
to bomb the location.

676
00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:32,204
Shaw dies an American hero.

677
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:33,372
Not if I can help it.

678
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:35,307
Okay, good. He's
still on the move.

679
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,009
Thank you, Casey.

680
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,345
I'm sorry. I can't
let you stay in here.

681
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:44,316
Now, Casey.

682
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,057
Hey!

683
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,392
Where is he?

684
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:54,960
Nice to see you, too.

685
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,862
Suspects have entered
the building.

686
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,430
That is incredible.

687
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:00,265
You guys are, like, the most
amazing stalkers I've ever seen.

688
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,967
I will tell my grandchildren
about you.

689
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:04,603
Wait. Wanna borrow
some brass knuckles?

690
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:06,138
Nunchuks?

691
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:09,074
Uh, why would you even have...

692
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:11,042
No. While I appreciate that,

693
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:13,545
Jeff, very much, I-I-I
don't believe in violence.

694
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:14,880
So, should they give
You a beat-down,

695
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,448
you expect us to have your back?

696
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,349
No, thanks. Okay. See you later.

697
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,187
Oh.

698
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,656
Here we go.

699
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,084
Wow.

700
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,225
Tracker's gone subterranean.

701
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,227
Location is stabilized
and remains fixed.

702
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:38,630
Agent Shaw has arrived
and the B-2 has been deployed

703
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:39,898
with bunker-busters.

704
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,233
What do you want to do?

705
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,634
Drop the bombs.

706
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:43,735
And Agent Shaw?

707
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:47,606
He's a true American hero.

708
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:57,850
Welcome, Daniel.

709
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,120
I've been waiting to meet you
for a long time.

710
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:04,590
If you're going to kill
me, get it over with.

711
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,725
I don't want to kill you, Daniel.

712
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,694
I want to educate you.

713
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,532
What is this?

714
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,467
A gift.

715
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,736
The answer you've been seeking
for all these years.

716
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,246
MAN (echoing):
Max, who loves you...

717
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,249
WOMAN: (echoing):
Happy birthday.

718
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,585
Okay, my turn. Give me the camera.

719
00:32:33,653 --> 00:32:35,954
Maybe it was a bad idea
to get you a video

720
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:38,390
for your birthday.

721
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,593
Come on. Now you're
Just wasting tape.

722
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,561
This is ridiculous.
Happy birthday.

723
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:44,863
How'd you get this?

724
00:32:44,864 --> 00:32:47,065
We have lots of information on Eve.

725
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,067
Just watch, Daniel.

726
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:52,137
It's time you learned the truth
about your wife's murder.

727
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:55,574
Thought you might like to see
some surveillance footage

728
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,542
from that night.

729
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,157
No!

730
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,393
It must be so difficult for you.

731
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,433
You didn't think
I'd come here in person.

732
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,102
I'll be in touch.

733
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:30,542
MAN (over radio):
Three minutes to target.

734
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:39,918
Huh. No flash necessary.

735
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,824
Good tranqs.

736
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,725
Freeze!

737
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:52,130
Drop it.

738
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:53,959
<i>MAN:
We got a lock on the tracker.</i>

739
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,107
BECKMAN:
Congratulations, Agent Walker.
We destroyed a Ring compound,.

740
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:51,209
hopefully eliminating
some of their higher-ups,

741
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:53,211
and you managed to rescue
Agent Shaw.

742
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:55,680
Once again, you and
your team prevail.

743
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:57,682
I can't take any of
the credit, General.

744
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,984
It was all Chuck.
He saved Shaw by himself.

745
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:01,119
Duly noted.

746
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,554
Well, Agent Walker, it's been

747
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:05,824
a highly memorable
three years in Burbank.

748
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:07,058
I look forward

749
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:09,694
to working face-to-face
with you in Washington.

750
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:11,996
Have a safe flight.

751
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:14,399
How's Shaw doing?

752
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,935
He's still unconscious,

753
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,337
but the doctors say he'll
make a full recovery,

754
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:20,905
thanks to you.

755
00:36:20,906 --> 00:36:23,308
Well, I mean, you
know he would have

756
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:24,976
done the same for me.

757
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:28,346
Look, I don't want
to pester you, Sarah,

758
00:36:28,414 --> 00:36:30,348
or become some, some nuisance

759
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,916
that you can't avoid.

760
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,351
I've seen Morgan
go down that road

761
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:35,086
far too many times to count.

762
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:37,555
And since I've already
given the fancy

763
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:39,691
eloquent version
of this speech before,

764
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:42,127
right now I'm just gonna be
blunt and honest.

765
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:47,465
I love you.

766
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:49,768
One more time just because

767
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:51,636
it feels really nice
to say: I love you.

768
00:36:51,637 --> 00:36:52,837
I feel like I've been bottling

769
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,039
this up forever. I love you.

770
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:56,307
Chuck, you don't have...

771
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:57,542
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

772
00:36:57,543 --> 00:37:00,245
I'm getting out of hand, but...

773
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:02,914
Look, you were right in Prague.

774
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:05,316
You and I-- we're perfect
for each other,

775
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:07,919
and I want to spend the
rest of my life with you

776
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:11,122
away from everyone else
and away from this spy life.

777
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,893
Chuck, I've made a commitment,
and not just to Shaw.

778
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,060
Don't go.

779
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:18,897
Don't do it.
Leave with me instead.

780
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:20,665
Today at 2:00, Union Station,

781
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,367
we go to Mexico, and after that,

782
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:23,401
anywhere that you want.

783
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:24,969
I would, however, like to go

784
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,905
and see the Eiffel Tower
at some point

785
00:37:26,972 --> 00:37:28,039
if that's at all possible.

786
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,073
Don't answer now.

787
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:31,109
Don't say a word.

788
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:33,578
I don't want to have
to convince you.

789
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:37,482
I just want you to show up.

790
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,585
I'm gonna kiss you now...

791
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:42,387
if that's okay.

792
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,411
I'm gonna go home to pack

793
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:09,347
both summer and winter wear.

794
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:13,184
I love you, Sarah Walker.

795
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:15,186
I always have.

796
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:31,135
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Morris, dial 183, please.

797
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:33,972
Dr. Morris.

798
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,692
This is Shaw.

799
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:10,909
You got a sec?

800
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,244
Uh, yeah, sure. Come on in.

801
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,317
Uh, can I get you
a drink or anything?

802
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:21,819
No, no, I can't stay.

803
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,388
I just wanted to come by

804
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:24,989
and tell you something
about Bartowski.

805
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,392
Well, if you came
to plead his case,

806
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:28,893
then that's really
not necessary.

807
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:30,194
No, he didn't send me.

808
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:31,496
He doesn't know I'm here.

809
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:33,965
I just wanted to tell you something

810
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,334
in case it changed anything.

811
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,371
He didn't kill the mole.

812
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:41,806
What?

813
00:39:41,807 --> 00:39:44,242
I did.

814
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,512
He didn't have the stones
to pull the trigger.

815
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,147
The kid's not a killer.

816
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:51,683
Just not wired that way.

817
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,785
Unlike us.

818
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,754
Just thought you should know.

819
00:39:56,822 --> 00:39:58,923
See you around.

820
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:01,626
Casey...

821
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:03,428
Yeah?

822
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:06,197
Thank you.

823
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:11,903
You have a nice life, Walker.

824
00:40:43,802 --> 00:40:45,069
Hey, Washington will have to wait.

825
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,138
We have a trace on the director.

826
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:48,673
I have the details
in the car. Come on.

827
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:50,174
Well, I need to call Chuck.

828
00:40:50,175 --> 00:40:52,644
There's no time. You
can do it from the car.

829
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:05,490
Chuck, we have
an urgent situation.

830
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:07,859
Our forensic team was able
to recover this video

831
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,861
from the wreckage
of the Ring's bunker.

832
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:12,997
The woman is Agent Eve Shaw,
Daniel Shaw's deceased wife.

833
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:14,832
Well, this is all very
touching, General,

834
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,768
but what does it have
to do with Sarah?

835
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:18,202
Keep watching.

836
00:41:18,203 --> 00:41:20,371
The data drive the Ring
recovered from the mole's body,

837
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:22,507
we now believe it contained
footage of a red test

838
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:25,276
conducted on the night
of Agent Shaw's death.

839
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,117
That's Sarah.

840
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,053
Sarah killed his wife.

841
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,788
Did you know?

842
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:38,189
I assure you I had no knowledge

843
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,223
that Agent Walker
was responsible

844
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:40,725
for Eve Shaw's death.

845
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,427
If Shaw has seen this...

846
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:45,296
if the Ring played
him this video...

847
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:47,498
Oh, my God.

848
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:49,434
Oh, my God. General,
where is Sarah now?

849
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:51,969
We believe she's with Agent Shaw.

850
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:55,973
Do you have any idea where
Agent Shaw might have taken her?

851
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,978
I still don't have a signal.

852
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:03,881
Daniel, where are you taking us?

853
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:07,485
To settle an old score.

854
