1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:02,708
Hi, i'm Chuck. Here's a few
things you might need to know.

2
00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:04,177
Your dreams are also proof

3
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:07,881
of stress the Intersect puts
on your brain,

4
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:09,950
likely leading
to serious

5
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,952
mental deterioration.

6
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,321
Shaw, you're not
bleeding anymore.

7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,756
That's right, Chuck,
I'm not.

8
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:16,757
What does that mean?

9
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:18,658
It means I'm still alive.

10
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,129
You work for the CIA?
This is about your father.

11
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:24,464
There are some very bad
people looking for him,

12
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:26,199
including a man
named John Casey.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,635
Last time he left, he made sure
that I had a way to contact him.

14
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:21,121
âª âª

15
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:49,182
Justin.

16
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,250
Ellie, hey.

17
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,284
Hey, I contacted my dad.

18
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,352
Can we meet?

19
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,020
Yeah, same place
as last time, okay?

20
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,789
Okay, I'll be there
in ten minutes.

21
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,790
<i>Hey,</i>

22
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,358
Morgan, hey, buddy.

23
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,361
Listen, I had another dream
last night.

24
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,630
It was about Shaw.

25
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,399
No, I haven't told Sarah yet.

26
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,635
Yes, I realize that honesty
is important in a relationship.

27
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:10,136
Who do you think I am?

28
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:12,038
Listen, just meet me at the
Buy More in, like, ten or 15.

29
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:13,507
Okay?

30
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,775
Whose relationship are
you talking about? Huh?

31
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,410
Uh... Morgan's, Morgan's.

32
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:18,712
Yeah, Morgan and Anna,
the past-

33
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,714
he's just been really tore up
about her lately, so...

34
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:23,950
Oh, I thought he
rejected her recently.

35
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,252
He did, he did, he did,

36
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:27,120
but the heart is a...
is a very, it's...

37
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,723
the heart is
a very complicated muscle.

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,791
Have I told you how beautiful
you look this morning?

39
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:32,926
I mean, just... aah!

40
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:34,827
Really,
and you smell...

41
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,596
...fantastic, too.

42
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:38,265
Oh, hey, maybe that was
just the Pop-Tart.

43
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,567
I got to go, bye.

44
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,869
Bye.

45
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,372
<i>Wait, wait,</i>

46
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,940
you dreamt Shaw was alive?

47
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,808
Chuck, you saw
him die, though.

48
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:50,577
You checked for
a pulse, right?

49
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:52,245
Well, he fell
into a river.

50
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,947
He fell into a river?!
Of course Shaw's alive!

51
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,848
Haven't you ever seen
a John Carpenter movie?

52
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,217
Buddy, are you going
to help me or what?

53
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,118
I can't tell Sarah
until I'm absolutely sure

54
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,687
because she has...
History with the man.

55
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:01,855
I know, I'm aware.

56
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,290
Chuck, the thing is:
if he's alive,

57
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,324
then he knows
everything about her

58
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,759
and he knows
everything about you,

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,362
everything about me- where I
work, where I live, what I eat,

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,031
shower...
Hey, buddy, hey, yo, Morgan.

61
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,732
This is
why we are going

62
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,368
to find him and figure out
what he's up to, okay,

63
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,203
but first I need to take care
of a few things here.

64
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:19,506
Remember, though,
this is between you and I.

65
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,574
Stay between me and you.

66
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,575
Okay, no problem, absolutely.

67
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,742
Listen, do me a favor:

68
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,110
before you go,
can you key me into Castle?

69
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,712
I left something down there.

70
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,147
Look, if you're
really afraid of Shaw,

71
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:29,115
I'll let you down there for
a little while. Thank you.

72
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:32,018
Thank you, you are a
lifesaver, sir, literally.

73
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,487
Yeah, good, okay, fine,
just-just don't touch anything.

74
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,455
Okay?
All right.

75
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:46,198
Okay, okay, okay.

76
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,234
Good, good, good, good.

77
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:50,804
Yes, oh, baby.

78
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,771
Come on.
Morgan.

79
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,375
What are you doing here?

80
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,710
Is Chuck up to something?

81
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,877
I don't know, you tell me.

82
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,112
You'd know better than I would.

83
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,580
Hey, have you seen, uh,

84
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,248
where they keep
the bulletproof pants?

85
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:05,085
You know, Morgan,
you and I-

86
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:07,721
we, uh, we never
talk, really.

87
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,222
Yeah, well,
talking's a bit overrated.

88
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:10,857
Plus, we don't have
a lot in common,

89
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,225
although I'd like to get
to know you better.

90
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:13,393
I mean, I don't feel
like there's...

91
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:15,962
Sit.
Okay.

92
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,133
You're going
to tell me

93
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,802
exactly what's going on and
you're going to do it right now.

94
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:37,050
Reviewing pictures
of people you killed?

95
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:39,386
I do that myself
from time to time.

96
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,855
No.

97
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,289
Chuck.

98
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,924
Chuck, we goa problem, bro.

99
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:46,092
Sarah knows about Shaw.

100
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,494
Yeah, yeah,
I broke, man.

101
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,595
Okay, y-your lady's
really intimidating.

102
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:49,929
You know, I tried
to make eye contact,

103
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,364
but she just kind of kept
pulling me in with this...

104
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,666
this gaze.

105
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,403
Morgan, how could you poss...
W- what is, what...?

106
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,504
Is that a bulletproof vest?

107
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,872
No, is that a
bulletproof tie?

108
00:04:58,873 --> 00:04:59,873
I don't...

109
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:01,774
I don't know what...
Give me a break.

110
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:07,147
That's my dad.

111
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:08,515
Why is my dad here?

112
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,716
What's the problem?
He thinks

113
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:11,384
I quit the CIA the night
of Ellie's wedding.

114
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:14,320
He does not know that
I downloaded the Intersect 2.0.

115
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:15,388
W- W-W-Wait,

116
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:16,890
wait, you didn't tell him?

117
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:17,991
Well, he spent
so much time

118
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:19,225
getting the damn thing
out of my ad.

119
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:21,661
Why would I tell him that?
Mush, mush, mush, mush.

120
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,631
Hi, hey, Dad, hi.

121
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,865
How are you?

122
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,767
What, uh, what are you...
what are you doing here?

123
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:28,968
Your sister contacted me.

124
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,637
I wanted to check
with you and make sure

125
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:31,638
that everything was okay.

126
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,539
Is that...?

127
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,409
Is that John Casey?

128
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:37,977
That is John Casey.

129
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:39,979
Of course, yeah,
you know that he works here.

130
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,282
Why? He's an NSA agent,

131
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,284
and if the Intersect
project was disbanded,

132
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:45,318
why would he...?

133
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,353
Shaw?

134
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,956
Sarah, you remember
my father.

135
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,992
Oh, hi, Mr. Bartowski.

136
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,828
I- It's great
to see you.

137
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,162
Why is your handler here?

138
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,832
Handler... no.

139
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,667
Oh, you've been
out of the loop,

140
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,202
so I can't expect you
to know this,

141
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,637
but-but Sarah and I are
boyfriend and girlfriend now.

142
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,106
Hi, sweetie.

143
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:09,075
Tell me that you're not
in the CIA anymore.

144
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:10,243
Tell me that you quit.

145
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,579
Dad, the Intersect
is out of my head.

146
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:13,847
I've moved on.

147
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:17,517
<i>I can assure you-
we can assure you...</i>

148
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,454
...that I am no longer a spy.

149
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:24,157
You know me,
I wouldn't lie.

150
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:32,803
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

151
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:09,989
This is Incredible.

152
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,224
From the outside it looks like
a regular office building.

153
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,526
Well, that's the point.

154
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:14,727
We're the CIA.

155
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,329
Nothing's what it seems.

156
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,564
Right this way.
Okay.

157
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,475
So you were able
to contact your dad?

158
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,043
You could say that.

159
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,545
He's, uh,

160
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,513
he's a little neurotic.

161
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,550
A coded message in the
classified section is his way

162
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:39,919
of getting
in tch with me.

163
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:44,156
Perfect.

164
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,858
So, once he tells
you where he lives,

165
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:48,961
we'll be able to protect him
and you can tell him everything.

166
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:51,230
What about John Casey?

167
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:52,365
If he's
a double agent...

168
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:53,532
Ellie, he's been living
in your building

169
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,167
for three years, just observing.

170
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,103
There's no reason to think
that'll change now.

171
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,841
But... this may put
your mind at ease.

172
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,377
That's a speaker.

173
00:08:04,378 --> 00:08:05,544
I don't understand.

174
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:09,482
Like I said, nothing's
what it seems.

175
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,916
It's not really
a speaker.

176
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,385
It'll protect you.

177
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:14,487
It'll block all of Agent
Casey's audio and visual reads

178
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:16,155
on the courtyard,

179
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:17,423
and, Ellie, if you
ever feel nervous,

180
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:19,324
even for a second,
just call me.

181
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,560
You know you can trust me,
right?

182
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:25,131
I do.

183
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,500
I think you should tell
your dad the truth.

184
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,469
I mean, you need to be honest
with the people that you love,

185
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:33,506
and that goes
for me, too.

186
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,007
I know, I know,
Sarah, I'm sorry.

187
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,909
I wanted to tell you about
Shaw, but it was just a dream,

188
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:38,811
and I-and I wanted to be
sure before I worried you.

189
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,046
But if you dreamt
that Shaw was alive,

190
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,114
then you dreamt it
for a reason.

191
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:43,616
I mean, the doctor said
that you're healthy

192
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:45,918
and that your dreams could be
as accurate as your flashes.

193
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,154
Right?
Ye... uh, yeah,

194
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:50,289
yeah, that's right.
Let's hope so.

195
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:52,658
I'm not letting you go to
Beckman till we know for sure.

196
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:55,194
I ran a scan on all of
Shaw's known aliases.

197
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,596
No activity since Paris.

198
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:59,698
I think our best shot
at finding him is Walker.

199
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,200
Why?

200
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,735
W- Why?

201
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:05,805
She has an... intimate knowledge
of the target.

202
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,707
I think "intimate" is a-is a
bit of a... bit of a stretch.

203
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:11,677
If Walker goes through all
the places she went with Shaw,

204
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:12,912
all the things they did,

205
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:14,080
maybe you'll flash

206
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,748
on something that leads to him.

207
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,817
Would you be okay
with that, Chuck?

208
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:20,119
Of course. Of course.

209
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:22,053
Why wouldn't I b

210
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,525
So, what exactly
did you and Shaw do

211
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:27,993
when you were in D.C.?

212
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,428
Casey...

213
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,198
...they were in and out of
meetings all day, every day.

214
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,933
I mean, the trip
was purely spy-related.

215
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:34,934
All business, no pleasure.

216
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:35,935
Well,

217
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,269
Walker, I have
here a receipt

218
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,605
from a waterfront
restaurant named Le Jardin.

219
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,307
Two chef's
tasting menus,

220
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:42,775
couple of nice
bottles of Pinot...

221
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:44,977
Doesn't sound like business
to me.

222
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:58,224
After our couples massage,
he toome to Tiffany's.

223
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,692
Did he buy you
anything? Please.

224
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:02,595
Everybody knows that you go to
Tiffany's to browse, not buy.

225
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:05,164
Are those new earrings,
Agent Walker?

226
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:15,508
Okay, so, on March 22,

227
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:18,010
you and Shaw were off-
grid the whole day.

228
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,678
What exactly
were you doing?

229
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,447
Objection.
Relevance?

230
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,983
What was so compelling
that you didn't check in?

231
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,519
We spent the day in his
loft downtown, okay,

232
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,486
at the Hoff Building.

233
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,261
Mm-hmm.

234
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,362
Was it the penthouse?

235
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:37,563
Yes.

236
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:38,564
Did you flash?

237
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:40,399
Shaw ordered the CIA
to construct

238
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,735
a TR-15 safe in his penthouse.

239
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:45,271
Whatever he's hiding in there
could lead us to him.

240
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:48,007
Looks like we're going to get
to see Shaw's bachelor pad,

241
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,009
although for some of us,
it won't be the first time.

242
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:54,947
âª Ooh, ooh, love hurts âª

243
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:57,683
âª Love scars âª

244
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:02,521
âª Love wounds and mars âª

245
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,658
âª Any heart âª

246
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:07,493
âª Not tough... âª
Hey.

247
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:08,727
Excuse me.
Yes?

248
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,628
Please, stop.

249
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:14,934
Awkward.

250
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,669
And cruel, but not incorrect,

251
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,604
because you are not playing
from your soul.

252
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,439
You're soulless
in Seattle.

253
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,275
That's quite a wad of cash you
hustled on Buy More property.

254
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,777
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
This is our dream.

255
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:26,245
We're on break.
You can't touch us.

256
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,546
I don't want
to touch you.

257
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,081
I want to help you.

258
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:30,549
In case you forgot,

259
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,518
I know a thing or two
about management.

260
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,253
You're too good
to be playing

261
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:36,522
outside a chain
electronics store.

262
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,057
If I was your manager,

263
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:40,226
<i>you might be playing inside
a chain electronics store.</i>

264
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,727
Yeah, we've already
played the Buy More.

265
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:43,796
We don't need you.
I'm listening.

266
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,531
What?

267
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,900
Having a manager
means having respect.

268
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,636
How many times do I have
to tell you? Art: good.

269
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:53,539
Commercialism:
bad, evil, weird... chubby.

270
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:55,507
But you know what?
I'm... I'm tired of it.

271
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:57,910
You want his empty words and
his razzmatazz wordplay,

272
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:00,079
you take it.
You take it, and you go solo,

273
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:02,181
and you see how that
works out for you.

274
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,950
Just try and stop me
from walking away.

275
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:06,986
Just try and stop me.

276
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:08,454
You just try.

277
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:09,588
You try and stop me from...

278
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:10,656
You're not going to even...?

279
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,124
That's what...
you know what, fine.

280
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,859
But I'm ing to take something
with me

281
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,794
that you can never have back.

282
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,762
The 'ster!

283
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,033
As in Jeffster!

284
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,934
Take the...

285
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,642
Dad.

286
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:33,846
What is going on?

287
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:35,047
How did you
get in here?

288
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:36,248
Ellie, hi.
Hi.

289
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,450
Dad, I told you that I
wanted to come to you.

290
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,518
You shouldn't...

291
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,086
What are you doing here?

292
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,290
Why do my children
always ask me that?

293
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:45,658
You're my daughter.

294
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:47,459
Of course, I'm going
to come to you.

295
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,628
Yeah, but...
And this is safer.

296
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:52,197
Okay? I-I-I...
I thought you'd be happy.

297
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:54,033
I am. I'm happy.
I'm happy.

298
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,601
I'm just...
I'm surprised.

299
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:56,669
In a good way.

300
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,736
Oh.

301
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,637
Good.

302
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,275
Shaw was a part
of our team for months.

303
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,044
He knows everything-
all of our weaknesses-

304
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,312
including this place.

305
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:07,613
I'm worried he's going
to come after Ellie.

306
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,214
We don't know what
he wants. Exactly.

307
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:10,616
Which is why I
need your help.

308
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:14,787
I need you to look after her
for me, make sure she's okay.

309
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:16,755
Until we know
what Shaw wants,

310
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,924
Ellie Bartowski
has a second shadow.

311
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:20,326
<i>STEVE
No.</i>

312
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,528
No, you were five,
and-and-and you refused

313
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:25,764
to get out of the car for school
unless you were wearing

314
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,933
the Hawkman costume
that Ellie made.

315
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,468
It's true.

316
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:31,337
I think... I think I still have

317
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:33,072
that Thanagarian helmet,
actually.

318
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,574
Dad, how do you
even remember that?

319
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:38,310
I... you know, I remember
a lot of things.

320
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:40,278
Uh...

321
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:43,215
So, what do you guys want
to do tonight?

322
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:44,917
Oh, actually, you know
what, I've got a...

323
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,352
kind of a date night with Sarah.

324
00:13:46,353 --> 00:13:47,786
We're going to be staying
downtown tonight.

325
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,788
Sorry- it was kind of
a last minute thing, so...

326
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,724
Well, uh, it'll just be
you and me, then.

327
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:53,158
It'll be great.

328
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,294
We can talk about whatever it
is you wanted to talk about.

329
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,634
Oh, no. You know what?

330
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:04,269
This is, uh...
this is the hospital.

331
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,671
I... I got to go.

332
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,906
I'm still tying up loose ends
from that Africa trip.

333
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,241
You went to Africa?

334
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:11,110
Yeah. It's...
it's such a long story.

335
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,578
I'll-I'll be back soon, okay?

336
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,479
Stay here.

337
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:22,121
Justin, thank God you called.

338
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:24,056
My dad, he just surprised me.

339
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:25,758
He's here.
In Echo Park?

340
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,626
I thought you
were getting his address.

341
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:29,595
He just showed up. What do I do?

342
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,232
John Casey's home.

343
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,733
Okay. It's going to be fine.

344
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,168
Meet me
at Bellevue Square alone,

345
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,437
and we'll figure out what to do
about your dad.

346
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:40,439
Okay.

347
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,247
So, this last-minute trip
with Sarah-

348
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:51,750
you're not going on some sort
of a mission, are you?

349
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:54,219
Dad, we just had a
really nice meal, okay?

350
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,455
What's with all
the spy questions?

351
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:59,057
Because I don't know anything
about your life,

352
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,993
and I'm here,

353
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:04,196
and I-I'm trying to figure out
what I missed,

354
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,299
I see one thing.

355
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,468
Casey works at the Buy More.

356
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:11,737
Sarah lives with you, and...

357
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:14,740
this is an active
surveillance wire.

358
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:16,141
Okay?

359
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:20,412
And your computer
is still tapped in

360
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,215
to the CIA mainframe.

361
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:24,516
So, you tell me
again, Charles,

362
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:25,984
that you're not involved
in anything dangerous,

363
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:28,520
that you're...
that you're not a spy.

364
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,896
Okay, I will occasionally
do some analysis work

365
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:39,864
for the CIA.
It's a desk job.

366
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,800
It's a glorified
paper pusher. Charles.

367
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:43,535
Dad, I sit behina desk,
and I input data

368
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:45,070
a couple of times a month.
It's nothing dangerous.

369
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:47,473
And this... this thing tonight
with Sarah?

370
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,308
Is really just a night away
with my girlfriend.

371
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,209
You have nothing
to worry about, Dad.

372
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,513
I'm just an analyst.

373
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,525
Did your ears just pop?

374
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,777
Hey, it's me.

375
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,745
Uh, I'm here and you're not.

376
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:29,414
I really need to see you.

377
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:31,250
Devon thinks
that I'm at the hospital.

378
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,485
It's just... it's getting harder
and harder to lie.

379
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:36,054
Please call me, okay?

380
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,334
So, this is Shaw's
penthouse, huh?

381
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,302
Yep.

382
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,338
Great. I'll check over here.

383
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,818
I found the safe.

384
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:12,524
Where's the safe?

385
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:14,425
Put these on.

386
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,161
Hey.

387
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:21,366
How do... how do you...
how do you get to it?

388
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,107
Oh, it's password-protected.

389
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,943
We're going
to be here a while.

390
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,477
Well, maybe we start
with something common.

391
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:35,280
You know, birthday,
pet's name... your name.

392
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,419
It's Shaw.

393
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,502
Go, go, go, go!

394
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:05,961
Wait, wait,
wait, wait! No.

395
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:07,462
We need to know what
Shaw wants first.

396
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:09,197
Okay? You get the briefcase;
I'll make the jump.

397
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,098
Okay. Well, just be careful.

398
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:14,503
Okay. Come on, Intersect.

399
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:16,638
What do you got for me?

400
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,012
This should be interesting.

401
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,927
Shaw.

402
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,267
Shaw is dead.

403
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,569
Care to join him?

404
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,907
Did you get him?
Did you get him?

405
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:55,477
If you... if you did,
make sure and check his pulse.

406
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:57,846
But help me first. Okay,
hold on. I'm coming, Chuck.

407
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:59,814
Help me first before you
check his pulse. Help me.

408
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,351
Sarah, he's coming back.
He's coming back.

409
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:07,956
Dad.

410
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,857
Just an analyst, huh?

411
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,465
So, this is my office.

412
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,200
Pretty...
pretty sleek, huh?

413
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,269
Why weren't you here,

414
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,471
sitting at one of
these computers

415
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,073
instead of dangling
from a rooftop?

416
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:26,508
Why are you still
lying to me?

417
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,176
Dad, it's like...
it's like I told you.

418
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,378
The government sees a lot
of potential in me, you know,

419
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,080
so General Beckman asked
if I would work

420
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,382
as an analyst for the CIA,
and then every once in a while,

421
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,217
I'll still go off on,
you know,

422
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,118
a little field mission.

423
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,788
Could you excuse me
just for one second?

424
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:41,423
And please don't touch
any of the computers.

425
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:43,925
'Cause I know you want to,
but don't do that.

426
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,361
So, the guy on the roof-
who was he?

427
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,331
Couldn't get a good
look at our mystery man

428
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:51,132
from the building's
security cam footage.

429
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,901
How'd he know about the loft?

430
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:55,003
Best guess: when you
accessed the penthouse,

431
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:56,738
you triggered some
sort of alert.

432
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,473
He was after this.

433
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,308
Lockbox.
Just like the one

434
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:01,476
Evelyn Shaw had.

435
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,178
Okay, well,
why does Shaw have one?

436
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,613
It's essentially a spy's

437
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,081
last will and testament.

438
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,415
All spies keep a record

439
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,450
of the information
they might lose

440
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:09,651
if they get killed
on a mission.

441
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,186
In Shaw's case,
all the information

442
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,087
that the CIA has on the Ring.

443
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,989
My bet is they're going
to want this back.

444
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:16,491
100 bucks says he's
working for them.

445
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,526
And if the Ring
is looking for this,

446
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,729
then it must mean
that Shaw is dead.

447
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,835
"My name is Daniel Shaw,

448
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,871
and if you are reading this,
it means I'm already dead."

449
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,806
I was wrong.

450
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,707
Wrong about what?

451
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,712
I've heard the name,
Daniel Shaw, before.

452
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,048
He... he's a special agent

453
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:42,884
for the CIA-
a Ring expert.

454
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:44,452
I take it that's his lockbox.

455
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:45,620
What happened?

456
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,788
That mission's over, Dad.

457
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:48,390
No, it's never over.

458
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,392
There will always be another one
and another and...

459
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,927
The reason a spy
has to have one of those

460
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,230
is because any mission
they go on could be their last.

461
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,432
For every spy, there's
someone who cares about them.

462
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,401
Someone who has
to open that box,

463
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,336
read that message,
and mourn their loss.

464
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:03,905
This is a bad business.

465
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:06,608
And I don't want my
family any part of it.

466
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,917
Sorry I didn't make it
to the square.

467
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,753
It's fine. Are you okay?
What happened?

468
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,321
I wish I could
tell you,

469
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,957
but the most pressing issue
is what to do about your father.

470
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:26,261
Do what? John Casey's
watching us like a hawk.

471
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,796
That's why
we've devised a new plan,

472
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:30,298
but it's going to require
some real spy work on your part.

473
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,367
You up for it?

474
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:43,824
âª My name is Jeff, uh, Jeff,
Jeff âª

475
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:46,127
âª That's right, I said
my name is Jeff, uh, Jeff âª

476
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:48,162
âª Uh, Jeff... âª

477
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,397
That's good, son,
but it might be a little...

478
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:51,932
lyrically lacking.

479
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:54,969
JEFF
âª Hey, girl âª

480
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:57,204
âª Whatcha got for me? âª

481
00:22:57,272 --> 00:23:00,107
âª You want to get up on here
and have a baby wit' me? âª

482
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:02,075
âª Yeah âª

483
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,078
âª Oh, I see how it is âª

484
00:23:04,146 --> 00:23:06,046
âª Well, I don't need ya âª

485
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:09,683
âª Your uterus won't fit my baby
in it anyway âª

486
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:12,086
âª My name is Jeff,
uh, Jeff, uh, Jeff âª

487
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:13,587
âª I'm the baddest man... âª

488
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:15,488
Hey, have you
seen Grimes?

489
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,558
Lost your friend, did you?

490
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,160
Can't find him
'cause he's changed so much?

491
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:20,528
But you can't help

492
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,996
but think about the days you
guys used to drink together

493
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:23,497
and hold each other
for hours and hours,

494
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:25,099
just talking about
even the silliest little things.

495
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,667
âª Lift up your frown âª

496
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:28,302
Those days are no more.

497
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:30,203
They're no...
âª My name is Jeff âª

498
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,540
âª Uh, Jeff, uh, Jeff... âª

499
00:23:32,607 --> 00:23:35,109
Don't you knock?

500
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:37,311
Shaw is alive, okay.

501
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,879
And he's bringing a reckoning
with him.

502
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,714
Ah. No one told you, huh?

503
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,216
Shaw's dead.

504
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,985
No. No. Chuck said.
He... Bartowski's wrong.

505
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,253
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

506
00:23:46,254 --> 00:23:47,955
Man, someone could have given me
a heads-up here.

507
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,690
I've had to pee
for, like, the last four hours.

508
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:51,258
But I'm not here for that.

509
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,761
Listen, would Ellie cheat
on Devon for any reason?

510
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:55,763
John Casey, if I had the
height or the willpower,

511
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,731
I would slap you across
the face right now, okay?

512
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,999
No, Ellie is
not a cheater.

513
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,401
The only way
she'd ever step out

514
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:01,936
was with someone
that she's known her whole life,

515
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:03,537
someone she trusts.

516
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:05,172
A childhood friend perhaps.
I don't know.

517
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:06,740
Mm-hmm. I tapped into her phone.

518
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,975
She left this strange message.

519
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,710
I really need to see you.

520
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,445
Devon thinks
that I'm at the hospital.

521
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:14,215
It's just... it's getting harder
and harder to lie.

522
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:15,382
That's Ellie.

523
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:17,151
Oh...

524
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,419
Oh, man.

525
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,687
So what's the deal?

526
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,222
You've done well, John,

527
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:23,757
but you're a man who lacks tact
and interpersonal skill.

528
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:25,392
Okay, on behalf
of the family,

529
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:27,928
I'll speak to the
husband, all right?

530
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:29,896
This is not gonna be fun.

531
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:33,701
Devon, yeah, so you think
Ellie's happy in your marriage?

532
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:35,035
Of course.

533
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:37,338
Why? Did she
say something?

534
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:39,573
No. No, not exactly,
but I feel pretty confident

535
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,809
that if there is something
wrong, it's your fault.

536
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,812
So, take me through
an average day, and then,

537
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,680
you talk, I find the problem.

538
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,581
Okay.

539
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,284
Well, most mornings,
I wake up around 6:00,

540
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:51,652
I pop a towel in the dryer

541
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,454
so it's warm when she
gets out of the shower.

542
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:55,556
I'll whip her up a
Belgian waffle, or,

543
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:57,258
you know, goat cheese omelet.

544
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:59,159
Something easy.

545
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:01,061
After Ellie's
daily foot rub,

546
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:02,696
I'll bike to the
farmer's market,

547
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:03,931
pick up some fresh blueberries,

548
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:05,532
or you know,
whatever's in season.

549
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:07,234
Come home, make
her a smoothie.

550
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:08,636
Organic nonfat milk,

551
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,004
flaxseed oil.

552
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:11,905
You know, something to give her
a real midday kick start.

553
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:14,575
Once we're in bed,

554
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:17,511
post-lavender bath,

555
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:20,214
I spend about 20 minutes
just watching her sleep.

556
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:22,349
She looks so
peaceful.

557
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,317
It's, like, what's she dreaming
about, you know?

558
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:27,721
Anyway, that's my day,
give or take.

559
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:29,622
Yeah.

560
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:33,861
Hey, Dad.

561
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:37,898
Is everything okay?

562
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:40,000
I- I just keep thinking.

563
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,104
Without the Intersect...

564
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,608
...why would they let you go
on missions?

565
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:49,310
I mean,

566
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:52,179
you're-you're...
you're an ordinary guy.

567
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:53,981
I'm not.

568
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:55,716
I'm not an ordinary guy.

569
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:57,751
The CIA wants me
to work for them

570
00:25:57,819 --> 00:25:59,719
because they think I'm special.

571
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:03,891
'Cause they believe in me.

572
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:05,759
You're right, Charles.

573
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,660
You are special.

574
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,666
I knew it.

575
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:16,136
You downloaded
the Intersect 2.0.

576
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:18,105
You threw a knife at my face.

577
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:19,340
Why would you do that?

578
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,141
After I worked so hard
to get the first one out.

579
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,777
Dad, knife! Face!

580
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:25,212
What if you
were wrong?

581
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:27,181
I'm never wrong.

582
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,085
Charles,

583
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:34,288
there's something
that I never told you.

584
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:36,323
The Intersect-

585
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:38,692
it can have a negative effect
on the brain.

586
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,094
Hold-Hold... Hold on.

587
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:41,962
What? You... you knew?

588
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:43,797
You-you knew,
and you didn't tell me?!

589
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:45,232
I didn't think
I had to tell you.

590
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,867
You didn't tell me
you downloaded the new one!

591
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:49,002
But that's because I knew
you would disapprove of it.

592
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,637
<i>And-and... you know what?
And you left.</i>

593
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:52,573
Again.

594
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,975
You taught me and Ellie
how to live life without you,

595
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,943
and that's exactly
what I'm doing.

596
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:06,086
I... I have to go.

597
00:27:06,154 --> 00:27:07,721
Right now.

598
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:09,356
What?

599
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:11,492
Wait. Wait. Dad. Dad,
where-where are you going?

600
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,026
I'm sorry.

601
00:27:13,027 --> 00:27:15,629
I can't stay here
and watch my son die.

602
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:23,537
Dad?

603
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:24,905
You're-you're leaving?

604
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:26,373
Weren't you going
to say good-bye?

605
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:27,708
Oh. Sorry. I'm, uh...

606
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:30,043
I still don't even know
what's wrong,

607
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,745
why you wanted me here.

608
00:27:31,746 --> 00:27:33,881
Nothing. Nothing's wrong, Dad.

609
00:27:33,948 --> 00:27:35,149
Oh.

610
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,784
I just, uh... I missed you,

611
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:38,585
and I wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

612
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:40,486
Oh, okay.

613
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:43,424
Well, you-you don't have
to worry about-about me,

614
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:44,658
uh, Eleanor.

615
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:45,826
Um,

616
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:47,060
this time,

617
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:48,961
I won't be gone as long,
I promise.

618
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:50,897
Okay.
Okay.

619
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:53,333
Take care of yourself?

620
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,980
I did it.

621
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,616
I planted the tracer.

622
00:28:09,617 --> 00:28:11,385
Nice work, Ellie.

623
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:14,188
You've guaranteed
your father's protection.

624
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,587
Where's your dad?

625
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,389
He found out I was
the Intersect, and he left.

626
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,725
<i>Chuck, he must have had
a good reason.</i>

627
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,393
<i>He loves you.</i>

628
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,162
I know. I-I...

629
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,930
I know that he loves me.

630
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,232
He just doesn't know me.

631
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,133
He doesn't know anything
about me.

632
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,936
<i>Why I became the Intersect,</i>

633
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,705
<i>that-that...
that I can help people.</i>

634
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,673
<i>That for the first time
in my life,</i>

635
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,742
<i>what I do actually
means something.</i>

636
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,211
Did you tell him that?

637
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,280
No.

638
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,815
<i>I guess I didn't.</i>

639
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,516
<i>But I can't talk to him now</i>

640
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,319
because he's gone,
and I don't know where he lives.

641
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,287
I do.

642
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,092
It's gonna work.

643
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,261
In the event
that your dad ran off,

644
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,464
I wanted you to be able
to find him, so...

645
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,532
I took this.

646
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,207
<i>Your misdemeanor aside,</i>

647
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,043
<i>my dad is an incredibly
paranoid person,</i>

648
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,545
and I'm sure that this isn't
his real address. Oh, I know.

649
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,481
But it was issued
by the Bishop County DMV,

650
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,949
and I checked all
the utilities databases,

651
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,217
and this is the only house

652
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,785
without cable,
water and gas,

653
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,022
<i>but also consumes an incredible
amount of electricity, so,</i>

654
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,790
I'm pretty sure
that's your dad's house.

655
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,225
<i>Wow. That's so...</i>

656
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,227
<i>Spyish?</i>

657
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,795
<i>Well,</i>

658
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,164
I am a spy.

659
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,407
Yeah. We're at the house.

660
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,909
Good. Don't call me again
until you have it.

661
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,639
Well, this must be it.

662
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,610
I'm just gonna go in there
and tell him how I feel.

663
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,845
Do you want me
to come with you?

664
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,247
No, it's okay.

665
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,117
But if I'm not back
in 20 minutes, you come save me.

666
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,186
Okay.

667
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,060
Where is it?

668
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,695
I don't know
what you're talking about.

669
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,996
Yes, you do.

670
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,866
My employer knows that
you have an Intersect.

671
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,469
Where's the thing
that's keeping you alive?

672
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,939
Dad, it's me.

673
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,941
Don't worry.
I'm alone.

674
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,257
Cut it. We'll make this
look like an accident.

675
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,495
Oh, that. Oh, that.
That-that's not safe.

676
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,163
That's not safe.
He shouldn't be doing that.

677
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,331
Mr. Bartowski,

678
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,233
this will all be
a lot less painful

679
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,335
if you tell me
where the Governor is.

680
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,237
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

681
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,572
Not you. Your father.

682
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,007
Aha.

683
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,142
What is he
talking about?

684
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,810
The Governor!

685
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,011
Oh.

686
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,147
It's the watch, isn't it?

687
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,784
No.

688
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,419
Tie them up.
Dad.

689
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,520
And let's clear out.

690
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,221
We don't want to be here

691
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,222
when this place goes up.

692
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,257
Sorry about this.

693
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,359
You shouldn't
have come here.

694
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,461
I didn't want to drag you
into anything.

695
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,429
Dad... Dad I came up.

696
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,265
I came up here because I wanted

697
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,166
to tell you why
I downloaded the Intersect,

698
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,068
that I'm... that I'm special,
and that I can help people.

699
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,236
But given the circumstances,

700
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,405
I think
I'm just gonna have to show you.

701
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,351
No guns!
The gas!

702
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,252
That's a good idea.

703
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,630
Does she have
the Intersect, too?

704
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,601
No, Dad.

705
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,804
That's all her.

706
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,772
Hi, honey.

707
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:37,340
Hey, come in.

708
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:40,977
I don't know
how the Ring found my cabin.

709
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,516
But I do know what they...
what they came for.

710
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:55,625
I call it the Governor

711
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:59,262
'cause it sort of
governs the Intersect.

712
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,331
See, I realized
through the years that...

713
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:02,565
that, just like a computer,

714
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,068
that th-the,
the Intersect can overheat.

715
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:06,569
Is that what's happening to me?

716
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,771
Yeah, see,
your brain is like a circuit,

717
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,775
and when you flash, it releases
a surge of electrical energy,

718
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,844
but if it's not controlled,
it can lead to dementia

719
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,081
a- a-and insanity,
maybe even death,

720
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,482
but I've been working on a fix

721
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:21,383
a- and this is the closest

722
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:24,687
that I've gotten to one.

723
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:28,157
See, i-it, um, it governs
my neural network

724
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:31,160
and helps control the
power of the Intersect,

725
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:33,029
almost like a, uh,

726
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,930
like a pacemaker would
for the heart.

727
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:37,767
Could something like that
work for the 2.0?

728
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:39,636
Well, I couldn't tell you
about it until now

729
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:42,171
'cause I needed to go back
to my cabin to be sure,

730
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,441
but, Charles, i-it will.

731
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,710
I'm gonna make you one.

732
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:52,448
You're my son,

733
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:56,519
and you downloaded the 2.0

734
00:34:56,587 --> 00:35:00,123
for the same reason I created
the original: to help people.

735
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,492
You want to be a spy.

736
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,094
I'm gonna do
everything I can to...

737
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:07,163
help you be the man
you want to be.

738
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:10,166
Thanks.

739
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:13,936
Thank you.

740
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,746
Lester, I want to help you be
the man you ought to be.

741
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:26,282
It's too late.

742
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,185
Jeff will be huge here,
then he'll be huge in Japan,

743
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,586
and then it's over.

744
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:31,754
Boy, don't you see?

745
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,390
The man made a banner
that said "Jef"

746
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,492
as if it were a question.

747
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,494
He doesn't know
who he is without you.

748
00:35:38,562 --> 00:35:40,697
You're more than just
the 'ster in Jeffster!

749
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,833
You're the 'ster
that stirs the drink.

750
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,102
I won't be fooled
by corporate trickery.

751
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,538
I will never bow down
to the man.

752
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,505
I'm not the man.

753
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,809
I'm a man...

754
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:55,878
a man who once had
a dream, too.

755
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:58,915
You ever heard
of Earth, Wind & Fire?

756
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,416
Yeah, they jammed.

757
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,353
For a short time in 1988,

758
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,723
we were called
Earth, Wind, Fire & Rain.

759
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,426
I was Rain.

760
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:13,162
âª Do you remember âª

761
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,032
âª The 21st night of September? âª
My God.

762
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,600
âª Love was changing the minds
of pretenders âª

763
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,569
I can't wear this anymore,

764
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,738
but you have the hips
of a six-year-old girl.

765
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,706
Use them.

766
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:27,877
âª Ah, ah, ba, de, ya âª

767
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:30,313
âª Say, do you remember? âª

768
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,348
Where do I sign?

769
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,317
âª Dancing in September... âª

770
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:35,685
Just depends
on your HD hookup...

771
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:36,686
Excuse me, guys.

772
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:38,788
Can I speak to you
for a second, please?

773
00:36:38,856 --> 00:36:39,889
Excuse me.

774
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:40,890
Yeah.

775
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,291
I talked
to Captain Awesome.

776
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:43,292
And?

777
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:46,596
If he'd have me,
I'd let him.

778
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,764
Look, what I'm saying is:

779
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:49,632
as much as it pains me
to say it,

780
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:52,101
if there's a problem here,
it's on Ellie's side.

781
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,269
Hey, look,
let me ask you something:

782
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,737
why are you even doing this?

783
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:58,074
I gave Chuck my word I'd make
sure his sister was okay.

784
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:02,278
You know what?

785
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:03,713
Awesome is volunteering
at the animal shelter,

786
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:04,947
Ellie is working
the late shift.

787
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:06,848
The apartment should be
completely empty.

788
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,850
Perfect.

789
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,420
<i>I'm gonna go take a look.</i>

790
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:40,583
JUSTIN Ellie, are
you with your husband?

791
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,185
No, my husband's not home.

792
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:43,986
Everybody thinks
that I'm working.

793
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:45,288
Okay, do you expect them back

794
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:46,422
anytime soon?

795
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:47,623
No, it's safe.

796
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:48,925
You're sure?

797
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:50,059
Yeah, you can come here.

798
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,294
Good, I'm already on my way.

799
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:53,195
Oh, okay, good.

800
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,400
There's someone in the house.

801
00:37:57,468 --> 00:37:58,701
How close are you?

802
00:37:58,702 --> 00:38:00,870
I'm close,
but I may not get there in time.

803
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:03,005
Go to the speaker.

804
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:06,576
Okay.

805
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,577
Now open it.

806
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,878
How?

807
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:11,714
Press all three buttons at once
and wait for a click.

808
00:38:20,691 --> 00:38:22,425
Justin, no, I can't, I can't.

809
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,759
Someone's in your house, Ellie.

810
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,628
He could hurt you,
hurt your family.

811
00:38:25,629 --> 00:38:28,264
Now take the gun.

812
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,795
Ellie, wait!

813
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,235
Justin,

814
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,070
Justin, John Casey...
Don't worry,

815
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:10,873
you're safe, come with me.

816
00:39:15,612 --> 00:39:17,613
Hey.

817
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:23,652
What's wrong?

818
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:30,092
I've been thinking about what
happened at the cabin and...

819
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,596
how you almost died.

820
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,164
You know, everything
that your dad said

821
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,799
about the life
that we've chosen-

822
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,601
he's right.

823
00:39:38,602 --> 00:39:40,636
What we do
is not safe.

824
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,740
I want you to have this.

825
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,477
My spy will.

826
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:52,548
Why are you giving me this?

827
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:54,550
Chuck, this is me.

828
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:56,085
It's everything I
know, it's my life,

829
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:58,921
and if something were
to happen to me...

830
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:04,393
Well, if anyone's going to
have it, I want it to be you.

831
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:07,263
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

832
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:09,231
You're not going
anywhere.

833
00:40:11,134 --> 00:40:13,636
And neither am I.

834
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,084
You'll be safe here
until we figure out

835
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:29,619
what to do about
John Casey.

836
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,555
I'm so sorry, I just...
I couldn't, I couldn't...

837
00:40:32,623 --> 00:40:34,056
Is my dad going
to be okay?

838
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,524
Don't worry, he's protected.
What about my husband, though?

839
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:37,059
What about my brother?

840
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,828
They're fine, I promise.

841
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:40,696
You've done everything
we've asked, Ellie.

842
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:41,964
You've been
incredibly brave,

843
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:44,300
and trust me, this
is almost over.

844
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:45,901
Now wait here.

845
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,070
I'll be back soon.

846
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:08,157
<i>"My name is Chuck Bartowski,</i>

847
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:10,660

no more waiting.
