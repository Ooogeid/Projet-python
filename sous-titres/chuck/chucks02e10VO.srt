1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,000
BUTTE, MONTANA 1990

2
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,900
She's hurt! Someone call 911!

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,500
Stand back. I'm a doctor.

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,000
All right,
sweetie. Okay.

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,700
She may have
broken some ribs.

6
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,200
Anybody know her parents?

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,800
All right, I'm gonna take her
to the hospital.

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Help me get her up.

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,200
- Ow! 
- Easy. Easy. That's
it. It's okay, sweetie.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,600
Thank you, sir.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good luck.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,000
That really hurt.

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,600
I think I sprained my wrist.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,200
Well, it's just a
flesh wound, darling.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,600
I can take you to the
hospital, or I can

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
get you some Rocky Road?

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Choice is yours.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Rocky Road.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,400
So, how much we get?

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Want to count it?

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
<i>Five and ten makes 20.</i>

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,600
Thank you. Have a nice day.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,700
Hey.

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,000
Long day?

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Boring day.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Well, not sure
if it's the excitement

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,500
that you're looking for,

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,000
but, uh, you want
to come over tonight

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
for a fake date
with Awesome and Ellie?

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
I promise fake cuddling,
but real pizza.

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,900
I'm sorry, Chuck.
I- I have plans.

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,400
Oh. Is there a mission tonight?

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
I- I don't remember
getting the memo.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,900
Uh, no.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
No mission. Just plans.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,500
Of course. Plans.

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,600
Like any other single
28-year-old spy

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
with an evening
to herself would have.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm sorry, Chuck,
but it's personal.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,200
AUTO AUDIO INSTALL
JUST ASK A NERD.

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,000
Hey.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,900
So, uh, ready for the
big mission tonight?

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,700
What mission?

44
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,800
You don't have to
play games, okay?

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,100
I know. You and Sarah-
super secret mission.

46
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,700
There's no mission, moron.

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,000
She's taking a personal day.

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
I didn't realize we
got personal days.

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,100
Well, you don't. We do.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
Any idea what she's up to?

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,900
- Yep.
- Well?

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,400
It's personal.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,700
Giving us a little privacy
so we can hook up.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,900
Come here.

56
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,800
- Come on.
- Morgan! No!

57
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sick of hooking up
only at work.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Ah, I'd love to go some
place else, but where?

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,300
My mother's always home,
you have three roommates.

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,500
I mean, I'm open
to suggestions.

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,700
Really? Good! Here.

62
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,300
The Buena Burbank Apartments.

63
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,900
They have really cute
one bedrooms.

64
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
See, I can't afford this.

65
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,100
We could together. We're ready

66
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
to take the next step.

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,700
Wow. We...

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,000
That's, um...

69
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
That's a very big
step, you know, and

70
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,200
I think that it's not something
that you should rush into.

71
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,900
I think that it's something
you should discuss.

72
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,200
I mean, look at this
place, all right?

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
72-inch plasma,
super comfy couches,

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,500
all the free coffee
we can drink.

75
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I mean, come on, baby.

76
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
We are living the dream.

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,200
Whose dream, Morgan?

78
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,600
Everyone's.

79
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,900
Hey, Chuck, you ever wonder

80
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,700
if you're not man enough
to hang onto your woman?

81
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,100
I need a Nerd Herder.

82
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,200
Uh-uh. No. Emmett found Jeff's
underwear in the back seat,

83
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
and he's having them
all reupholstered

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,500
as a safety precaution.

85
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,600
Okay, Morgan, I need
to borrow your bike.

86
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,900
Sure. Yeah, sure. Why?

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,500
It's personal.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,500
Plans, huh?

89
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,000
Honey, you look like
a million dollars.

90
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,900
How old is this guy?

91
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,300
Oh.

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,900
FORGERY

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,600
FRAUD

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,800
LARCENY

95
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
CHUCK

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,900
Let's eat.

97
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,700
Uh, excuse me
just a moment.

98
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,900
Yes, I-I'd like
the linguini

99
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,400
with the clam
sauce, please.

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,100
How did you find me?

101
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,600
The GPS on your watch.

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you doing here?

103
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,300
Look, I'm-I'm sorry.

104
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,400
I came for backup only.

105
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
I told you, it was personal.

106
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,500
I know. I know, but I flashed.

107
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,600
Look,

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm all... I'm all
for a little time off,

109
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
and God knows, you deserve it,
but I think that you should know

110
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,200
that the much, much,
much older gentleman

111
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,300
that you're having
dinner with right now

112
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,700
is a very bad man, Sarah.

113
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,900
- Chuck...
- Let me finish.

114
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
The guy is a total loser,
all right?

115
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,800
Absolute bottom-feeding,
scum of the earth,

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,300
have I mentioned,
considerably older man?

117
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,800
All true,
but I'm a hell of a dancer.

118
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,800
Chuck, I'd like you
to meet my dad,

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Jack Burton.

120
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,900
Dad, this is my boyfriend,
Chuck.

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
A real pleasure, sir.

French toast, whipped cream,
fresh strawberries.

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
- Just how you like them. 
- When I was 12.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
Well, you need to eat something.

128
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,700
Big day at work.

129
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,800
What is it you're
doing again?

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,100
Making milkshakes?

131
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,200
Frozen yogurt.

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,900
Oh. Sounds stimulating.

133
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,700
Pays the bills.

134
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Well, yeah, I
can see that.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,300
Very believable.

136
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,600
And what is that
supposed to mean?

137
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
This place. Your job. Your name.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Sarah Walker?

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
That schnook from
last night. Chippy?

140
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
- Chuck. 
- You're working an angle.

141
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
I mean, he's probably the son

142
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,800
of some, uh, rich
Beverly Hills family?

143
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,300
Look, Chuck is my boyfriend,
and he makes $12 an hour,

144
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,600
so you stay away from him.

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,300
Hey, you don't want
to cut me in, fine.

146
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,900
I don't need his money.

147
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
I got my own.

148
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
Oh, my God.

149
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,300
That looks like almost
a million dollars.

150
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,100
Well, Christmas
came a little early.

151
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,100
For you.

152
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,800
No, thanks.

153
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm not interested
in your stolen money.

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,700
Stolen? That's what you think
of your old man,

155
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,900
some two-bit thief?

156
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
Darling, a thief has
to run out of town

157
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,100
as fast as he can,
but a good con man...

158
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,300
A good con man can leave
whenever he wants.

159
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,200
I remember, Dad.

160
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,400
So, who donated the money
anyway?

161
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,500
A couple months ago,
I flew over to Dubai.

162
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,800
You wouldn't believe
the kind of money

163
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
they got floating
over there. Oh!

164
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,100
This particular donation is
compliments of Sheik Rajiv Amad.

165
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Amad? The Saudi oil family?

166
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,200
My daughter knows her Arabs.

167
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,500
I got to go to work.

168
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Um...

169
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,700
forgetting something?

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,400
Have fun at the office.

171
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
<i>GENERAL, In the spirit
of full disclosure,</i>

172
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,700
my father has conned
Sheik Rajiv Amad

173
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,600
out of nearly
a million dollars.

174
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,300
Hit the big time.

175
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Give the order,
and I'll bring him in.

176
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?! You're gonna arrest
your own father?

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Isn't that kind of
a conflict of interest?

178
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,900
If Agent Walker's
uncomfortable,

179
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,500
I'd be happy to
make the arrest.

180
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,100
No one is getting arrested. Yet.

181
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Amad's been on the CIA's
terror watch list for years.

182
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,100
He's suspected
of funding terrorist regimes

183
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,700
in Afghanistan and Kenya.

184
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,900
We have no recent photos,

185
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,200
and he goes by a number
of different aliases.

186
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Any information
your father could provide

187
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,300
about the sheik's
financial holdings

188
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,800
would be valuable intel.

189
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
General, my father is unaware

190
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,700
of my CIA career.

191
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,600
In fact, I'm not sure
he would be all that proud.

192
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,700
No one is asking you

193
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,000
to compromise your cover,
Agent Walker.

194
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
Just talk to your father.

195
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
Take the Intersect with you.

196
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
General, my father...

197
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,800
Your father conned
a very connected,

198
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,200
very dangerous man.

199
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,700
You better find out how deep

200
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,800
he's in before the sheik does.

201
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,100
- Captain Morgan.
- Hey, buddy.

202
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,800
Uh, have you
seen Chuck?

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,300
Left for work. What's up?

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
What's up?

205
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,700
Basically, my life is
over, that's what up.

206
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,700
You ready for this?

207
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,600
Anna asked me
to get an apartment together.

208
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
Whoa!

209
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Big step, little man. All right.

210
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know
about all right.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
I- I... You know what, man?

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
I just don't think
I'm ready for that.

213
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,600
Things are good with us.

214
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,300
You know, why-why
rock the boat?

215
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,300
Permission to speak freely?

216
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,300
There are no
secrets between us.

217
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,300
Would you agree
that you have no credit,

218
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,900
no life plan,
no apartment, no car,

219
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,200
no adult responsibilities
of any kind?

220
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,700
On rare occasion,
I do my own laundry.

221
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Time to grow up, Morgan.

222
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,500
I know. Here's the thing.

223
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,300
This apartment-
it's a lot of dough.

224
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,000
It'll clear me out.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're a little short on cash,

226
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
you know, we'll lend it to you.

227
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Don't worry about it.

228
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,100
Wait a minute.

229
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,500
You'd do that for me? Really?

230
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,500
Yeah.

231
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,700
That's-That's super cool, man.

232
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,100
Why?

233
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,500
Because I believe in you.

234
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Consider it an investment
in your future.

235
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Whoa. Are you...
Are you sure about that?

236
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,300
Yes, I'm sure.

237
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Besides, you'll pay me back.

238
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
12% interest every week,
or it goes up two points.

239
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,100
Absolutely. What does that mean?

240
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,500
$2,500 should cover it.

241
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,100
There you go, Morgan.

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,900
Welcome to adulthood.

243
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,900
We've been waiting for you.

244
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,300
<i>Sarah was just bluffing
with Beckman, right?</i>

245
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,000
I mean, she'd never
arrest her own father.

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,900
Why not? Guy's a criminal.

247
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Been in and out of jail
her whole life.

248
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,100
But he... but he
seems to care, though.

249
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,600
You know, I
mean, at least

250
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,500
he's attempting to
have a relationship.

251
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I don't even know where
my own father is.

252
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,900
Oh, that's sad.

253
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,000
You've confused me with someone

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that cares about your life
before the Intersect.

255
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,500
Good session, buddy.

256
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,300
Really feel like
we had a breakthrough there.

257
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,800
So long, Chuck.

258
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,400
We had a good
run, didn't we?

259
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Stuff of legend.
Where you headed?

260
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,600
Adulthood.

261
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,100
Anna and I are moving in
together.

262
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,300
Really? That's fantastic!
Congratulations, buddy.

263
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

264
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Enjoy your youth,

265
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,800
Charles.

266
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,800
Enjoy every damn
minute of it.

267
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,700
Dude, have you seen her?!

268
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,600
Who?

269
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,700
Just the hottest piece ever

270
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,300
- to come into this store! 
- Not even human.

271
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
- Smoking hot.
- Where?

272
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,100
Follow your boys.

273
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,700
1981 DeLorean DMC.

274
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Only 9,000 made.

275
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,200
<i>The exact car from
Back to the Future.</i>

276
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,000
Actually,

277
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,500
<i>the Back to the Future car
had a Porsche engine.</i>

278
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,000
When's it going
to be done?

279
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Few weeks.

280
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Months, at least.

281
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,500
Well, hopefully the iPod
adapter will help me sell it.

282
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,700
Are you serious?

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,400
How could you have any trouble
selling this treasure?

284
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
The passenger door
doesn't work,

285
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,900
the gas mileage
is horrible,

286
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,600
and if it actually goes
over 22 miles per hour,

287
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,100
it stalls.

288
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,500
REALLY?

289
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll take it.

290
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,800
Deal.

291
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes!

292
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,900
Good boy.

293
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,600
<i>He's not a schnook!</i>

294
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,100
He's a wonderful caring,

295
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
intelligent guy.

296
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,500
Who's a class A schnook.

297
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,300
Look, you don't want
to cut me in, no problem.

298
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,800
But don't play me
for a fool.

299
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
The guy has 2,200 bucks
to his name.

300
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
How do you know?

301
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
I lifted his ATM card
last night.

302
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,400
I wanted to check him out

303
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,100
'cause I was worried
about you.

304
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
And now that you know
he's broke?

305
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Now, I'm really worried.

306
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,500
I'm going to get a cab.

307
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,800
Charlie,

308
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
- there you are.
- Hi.

309
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,700
Good to see you again,
Mr. Burton.

310
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, please, please, Jack.

311
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,700
Nice tie.

312
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,100
Looking sharp, young man.

313
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,500
Well, I think he's warming up
to me.

314
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,400
This accidentally fell
into my father's pocket.

315
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,400
It's okay.

316
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,900
He's just being
protective of you.

317
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,200
And after the way
I behaved last night,

318
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
I can't say that I blame him.

319
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Chuck, you're attributing
good intentions to him

320
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,400
because you're a good person.

321
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,900
Well, he must have done
something right.

322
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,800
You turned out pretty good.

323
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Let's go.

324
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,000
<i>The trick wasit had to be
an actual accident.</i>

325
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Angel here was the best.

326
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,700
She could make a real doc

327
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,200
believe that she had
a broken arm.

328
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,900
Uh, that's because
I did.

329
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,100
One time-
that's only because

330
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,600
the armored truck
hit a patch of ice.

331
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
Unforeseeable
act of God, honey.

332
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
At least your childhood
was filled with excitement.

333
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,900
No kid had as much fun
as you did.

334
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,400
Um,

335
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,400
so this latest,
uh, score?

336
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,800
Sarah said you were just
in Dubai?

337
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,900
Sure it's okay?

338
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,700
Oh, he's fine. Trust me.

339
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Always, darling.

340
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,100
Never forget that.

341
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,100
Something about, uh,
a rich sheik?

342
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm not a boastful man, Charlie,

343
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,100
<i>but this was my Mona Lisa.</i>

344
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
These oil guys
were just

345
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,600
dying to buy anything American.

346
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Oh, no. You didn't.

347
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,700
Oh, yeah. Of course I did.

348
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,000
I think I'm missing
a step here.

349
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,900
He pulled a
Lichtenstein.

350
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,200
A Lichten what?

351
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Lichtenstein is a crazy
invention of my father's.

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,400
A German billionaire
who has fallen on hard times,

353
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,100
and needs to sell
something fast.

354
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,600
So, like, a piece of art,

355
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,800
- or jewelry?
- Bigger.

356
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,100
A boat? A plane?

357
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Closer, Charlie.

358
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,400
But I brought you

359
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
to my hotel for
a reason.

360
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
I sold them that.

361
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,100
You...

362
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,500
What?! You sold them

363
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,400
Nagamichi Plaza?
That's incredible.

364
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,500
That's dangerous.

365
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
- They're going to find you.
- Oh, relax.

366
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,000
The 700 grand
is a finder's fee

367
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,700
for putting them in touch
with Lichtenstein.

368
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,900
By the time they know it's gone,
I'll be on an island.

369
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
Remember, Charlie,
the bigger the lie,

370
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
- the easier...
- The easier it is to believe.

371
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,700
Very good.

372
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,700
<i>You think your dad
bought us as a couple?</i>

373
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,900
- He's a pretty sharp guy.
- He has his moments.

374
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,100
Maybe we should
amp up the PDA.

375
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,500
Try and sell it
a little better.

376
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,700
Very funny.

377
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Just make sure you
have your wallet.

378
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,400
Oh!

379
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,600
I just flashed.
That's him.

380
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
That's Sheik Rajiv Amad.

381
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,200
- Stay here. 
- What do you think he wants?

382
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,100
What do you think?

383
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,300
Lichtenstein.

384
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
Too bad
he doesn't exist.

385
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,300
<i>This, uh, this has all</i>

386
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,800
been a terrible
misunderstanding.

387
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,900
Why don't we

388
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,700
meet in the morning

389
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,400
in Mr. Lichtenstein's
office

390
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,100
and we can settle
this whole mess.

391
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,200
You must think I'm a fool,
Mr. Burton.

392
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,400
I want my money.

393
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,900
Well, you want
your money back,

394
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,300
that's fine,
but I have to warn you

395
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,600
then the deal is off.

396
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,400
In fact,

397
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,800
uh, this is
Mr. Lichtenstein's

398
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,900
personal secretary right here.

399
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,100
Ms. Applebaum?

400
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,400
May I present
Sheik Rajiv Amad.

401
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
It's a pleasure to meet you.

402
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,900
Mr. Lichtenstein has

403
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
been expecting you.

404
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,500
How's tomorrow at 2:00?

405
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,600
I have a better idea.

406
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,800
Why don't we go
get him right now?

407
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,400
I thought so.

408
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,500
There's no Lichtenstein.

409
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,100
Mr. Lichtenstein?!

410
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Is there
a Mr. Lichtenstein here?

411
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,500
<i>Ja.</i>

412
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,000
Uh, Mr. Lichtenstein,
you have a message.

413
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Uh, Sheik Rajiv Amad,

414
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
may I present

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,700
Hans Lichtenstein.

416
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Unfortunately, Mr. Lichtenstein
only speaks German.

417
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,100
But he'll be happy to meet you
tomorrow at his office.

418
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
2:00?

419
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Okay.

420
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,700
But if I don't get
my building,

421
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,500
he's a dead man.

422
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,500
Translate that.

423
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Okay.

424
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
I knew you two
were on the grift.

425
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,100
???

426
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,000
Hey, honey,
why is there

427
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,400
$2,500 missing
from our account?

428
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,400
I forgot to tell you,
I lent it to Morgan.

429
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,200
I can only assume

430
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,400
that you met some other Morgan
at work,

431
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,100
because the thought
of you giving away

432
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
a hunk of our nest egg

433
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,800
is just too horrific
to consider.

434
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,300
I didn't give it away.

435
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,300
I lent it to him

436
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,800
so he can get an
apartment with Anna.

437
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,400
Uh, Chuck, how much does Morgan
make at the Buy More?

438
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,300
Uh, about 12 bucks an hour.

439
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,900
Not including
his always

440
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,300
appreciating comic
book collection

441
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,500
which I would value
in the $500 area.

442
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,300
Devon...

443
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,200
It was an investment
in his future.

444
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
You know, so he could
become an adult.

445
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,700
That would probably be Morgan.

446
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,900
He's giving me a ride to work.

447
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,300
On what, his handlebars?

448
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,300
No, uh,

449
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
uh, Morgan,

450
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,400
Morgan bought a barely
functioning '81 DeLorean

451
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,500
that...

452
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,900
only goes 22 miles an hour,
so I better get going.

453
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,000
See ya.

454
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,100
You don't have to say it, babe.

455
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,700
I'll get our money back.

456
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,200
<i>General, I'd like to apologize</i>

457
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,000
for last night.

458
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
Chuck never should have
gotten caught up

459
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,900
in my father's
ridiculous con.

460
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,500
I recommend we place the
Intersect in protective lockdown

461
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,000
till we're sure the sheik
is out of the country.

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,900
And waste the perfect setup?

463
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,100
I'm not sure I follow.

464
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,000
The CIA has been trying to
locate the hidden bank accounts

465
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
of the Amad family for years.

466
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,100
If you can convince him
to wire you the funds,

467
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,300
we can access those accounts
and freeze them.

468
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,600
Uh, funds for what?

469
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,500
The building.

470
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
It will need to be
at least $10 million

471
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
to access his international
accounts.

472
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,700
General, is the agency
asking us to commit fraud?

473
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,500
No, that would mean the CIA has
some knowledge of your mission.

474
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,900
How are we supposed to sell a
60-story building in one day?

475
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,500
Ask your father.

476
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,900
He seems to be very proficient
in his chosen profession.

477
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,800
- Wait, this is the sound
coming from here. 
- Oh, that's...

478
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,300
Yeah, you thought
that the...

479
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,700
- No.
- Do you know where Morgan is?

480
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,100
Who's to say?
If he was able

481
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,200
to get a hold of some
high-grade plutonium,

482
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,400
he could be anywhere.

483
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
Any place.

484
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,000
- Any time.
- The Old West perhaps?

485
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
If I could travel
in time,

486
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,900
I'd go to Lester's birth.

487
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,600
I'd love to see the look
on your face

488
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,100
when you emerged
from the vaginal canal.

489
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,500
Morgan went to the DMV to get
plates for the DeLorean.

490
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
I lent him that money
to get an apartment,

491
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
not blow it on some
stupid car.

492
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,400
What?!

493
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,300
That money was
for our apartment?!

494
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I'm gonna kill him.

495
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,800
Get in line, Anna.

496
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
All right,
here's the thing.

497
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,700
I beg both of you
to reserve judgment

498
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,900
until you've seen
the plate.

499
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,900
'Cause you are
gonna be..

500
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Oh. Yeah.

501
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,500
I nailed it, right?

502
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,100
You have exactly one day

503
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,700
to get my money back
to me or I pluck you

504
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
from head
to toe.

505
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
Start with the groin.

506
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
He won't be using that region
for a while.

507
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,100
But, honey...
I got it for us.

508
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,300
<i>There is no reason
to walk away now.</i>

509
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,500
You know, I think we
could get the sheik

510
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,000
to pay a three
percent deposit.

511
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Market value is over
$300 million...

512
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's a lot of dough.

513
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,700
Remember darling, pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered.

514
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,400
Well, the bigger the lie,
the easier it is to believe.

515
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,900
We can do this.

516
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,300
I guess, uh, 5 mill each
ain't too bad.

517
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,700
Two point five.

518
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,700
You want my help, you
have to use my team.

519
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
What team?

520
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Mmm.

521
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,300
He's got a cop face.

522
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,900
No offense.

523
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,700
Look,

524
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,900
either he's in,
or none of us are.

525
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
Fine. But he's your problem.

526
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,900
All right, Sarah and I
will handle the deal.

527
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,000
Cop Face,

528
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
you're security.

529
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,700
We can switch names
if you'd like.

530
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,800
I can be Cop Face
and you can be Schnook.

531
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
We'll use our account number

532
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,000
for the wire transfer.

533
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Don't trust you.

534
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,700
No offense.

535
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Uh,

536
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
question-
what about me?

537
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
<i>I mean, I'm familiar
with Hogan's Heroes</i>

538
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,000
<i>and Castle Wolfenstein,</i>

539
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
but beyond that
my German is a little rusty.

540
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Schnook, your job is going
to be toughest of all.

541
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,100
You need to sit there
and not say a word.

542
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,900
All right, everybody
gather around.

543
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,500
First, we need

544
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,900
<i>to evacuate the current
building management.</i>
NAGAMICHI BUILDING 51ST FLOOR

545
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,700
Can I have your attention
please?

546
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,300
We need everyone out of this
office immediately.

547
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,900
This floor is being fumigated.

548
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,500
We have already

549
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,100
released toxic fumes.

550
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
That can lead to infertility

551
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,200
and low sperm count.

552
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,900
All right,
you heard them.

553
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Everyone out.

554
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Let's go, people.

555
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,500
Quickly. Quickly.

556
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,400
<i>Next,</i>

557
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,300
<i>we need to redecorate
Lichtenstein Enterprises.</i>

558
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
<i>Cop Face,</i>

559
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
<i>you're going to use
the gifts God gave you-</i>
LOBBY

560
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,100
<i>your cop face.</i>

561
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
They're here.

562
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Showtime.

563
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,700
<i>Most importantly,
we need to convince him</i>

564
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,400
<i>that we don't want
to sell the building.</i>

565
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,600
<i>He's the one
getting the deal, not us.</i>

566
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,900
I'm sorry,
Mr. Lichtenstein

567
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
will be in Prague
on Friday.

568
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,800
No, Monday
he's in Moscow.

569
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Wendy, I don't want
to be interrupted.

570
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,900
I don't care
if Mr. Trump calls.

571
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,100
Tell him the building
is no longer for sale.

572
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,900
I'll see him next week
in New York.

573
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,700
- Gentlemen, welcome.
- We'll have

574
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,600
to call you back next week.

575
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,000
Bye-bye.

576
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,300
Mr. Lichtenstein
will see you now.

577
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,300
Gentlemen,
may I present to you

578
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,800
Mr. Hans Lichtenstein.

579
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,000
Well, I'm sure

580
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,100
you're very busy,
so we'll make this

581
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,500
as painless as possible-
after your lawyers

582
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,700
examine the contracts
and the inspections

583
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
are done, we can have
a more formal meeting.

584
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,600
For now, we only require
a three percent deposit

585
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,500
to take the property
off the market.

586
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,000
And that would be...

587
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,800
$10 million.

588
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,100
First, I would like
to have a word

589
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,800
with Mr. Lichtenstein.

590
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Of course.
I'll translate.

591
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
<i>Herr Amad m. chte ein Wort
mit Ihnen.</i>
Mr. Amad would like a word with you.

592
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,900
I'm sorry.

593
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,700
I don't trust you.

594
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,900
I brought
my own translator.

595
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,300
<i>Hallo, Herr
Lichtenstein.</i>
hello, Mr. Lichtenstein.

596
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,100
<i>Irgendetwas, das
Sie sagen m. gen,</i>
anything you wish to say...

597
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,600
<i>sagen Sie durch mich.</i>
... you say through me.

598
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,400
That is the worst German accent
I have ever heard.

599
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,300
You... you butcher
my language.

600
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,000
The deal is off.

601
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,000
Sounds like Colonel Klink.

602
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,000
So, as far as you know,
no one ordered

603
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
an exterminator today?

604
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
I'm on my way now

605
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,900
to find out what the hell
is going on.

606
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,100
We got company.

607
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,200
Time to wrap it up.

608
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Amad.

609
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
It looks like
the deal is off,

610
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
but if I could have
your account number,

611
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,500
I'd be happy to wire you

612
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,200
the $700,000
that you gave

613
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
- to Mr. Burton.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

614
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,700
Now, there's no
reason to panic.

615
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Everyone,
calm down.

616
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,900
We can work this out.

617
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,300
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

618
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,500
Out of my building.

619
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,400
The deal is off.

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,600
Mr. Lichtenstein
has been offended.

621
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,900
Everyone out of the building.

622
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
There's no reason
to panic.

623
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,600
Uh, we're all
businessmen here.

624
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,000
Let's just sit down
and finish...

625
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
Enough!

626
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,400
You're all crazy.

627
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,800
No more games.

628
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,100
This is my building.

629
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,200
We had a deal.

630
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,000
Uh, well, Sheik, would you care
to, uh, type in

631
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,200
your account number
for security purposes?

632
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,200
Uh, just go ahead
and do the typey type.

633
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,300
<i>Feel free to look
over the space.</i>

634
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,900
We'll, uh,
give you a moment.

635
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,300
Never do business
with Germans.

636
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,700
Who the hell are you?

637
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,000
And how did you
get up here?

638
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,100
Why does that wall
say Lichtenstein?

639
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,200
To Lichtenstein.

640
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,600
Well,

641
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
you pulled it off, kid.

642
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
You made me
a believer.

643
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,100
Well, my German
is a little rusty, but...

644
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,900
No, no, that you two
are a couple.

645
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,400
For later, Cop Face.

646
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,500
Oh, victory smoke. Thanks.

647
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,800
You did good, baby.

648
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
- So did you.
- I'm gonna get some ice.

649
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,500
Well, I'm not one
to say I told you so,

650
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,600
but I think that worked out

651
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,000
pretty good, now,
didn't it?

652
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I guess he pulled through
for me... this one time.

653
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,600
Uh-huh.

654
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,000
Yes, General?

655
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,000
Mission accomplished.

656
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,400
The money was transferred
to the CIA account

657
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,500
about an hour ago.

658
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,800
Beckman never got the money.

659
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,400
The laptop is gone.

660
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,500
So is my cigar.

661
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,500
Hey.

662
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,700
They were all
out of fruit,

663
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,100
so I was forced
to bring up

664
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,700
a couple chocolate
croissants.

665
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,900
Oh, I guess I have no choice
but to take those off you.

666
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,100
Come in.

667
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,600
You okay?

668
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm fine.

669
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,300
My dad will turn up
somewhere,

670
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,900
but, uh, I guess
the real crime

671
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,500
is that we didn't get
to freeze the sheik's accounts.

672
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,400
Well, I'm sorry
if I pushed you

673
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,900
into trusting your father.

674
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
If there's one thing I learned
from my father,

675
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,400
it's be ready
for disappointment.

676
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,500
And if it's anyone's
fault, it's mine.

677
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,300
No, it's not.

678
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,800
11 years ago, my father
left Ellie and me.

679
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,200
He's a...

680
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
he was an unusual man.

681
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,700
I guess that's generous.

682
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
An engineer.

683
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,600
We used to get Christmas
cards and birthday calls,

684
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,100
and then one year it
just... it just stopped.

685
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,800
I don't know why.

686
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
What I do know

687
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,500
is that it
wasn't my fault.

688
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,600
Granted, it took a significant
amount of time and...

689
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
an incredible
amount of therapy

690
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,600
to come to that
realization,

691
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,500
but...

692
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400
you need to know that
your father's sins

693
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,500
are his and not yours.

694
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,700
That's pretty eloquent
for 9:00 a. m.

695
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,000
What can I say?

696
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,900
I am an articulate schnook.

697
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,100
Lucky for me.

698
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,800
You're alone?

699
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Yes, General.

700
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,800
We've tracked down Jack Burton.

701
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,700
He checked into a downtown motel

702
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,100
under the alias, Guido Merkins.

703
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,300
Well, I understand the
sensitivity of the situation.

704
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,500
I'll go alone.

705
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Agent Casey?

706
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,200
Yeah?

707
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,600
Tell Agent Walker I'm sorry.

708
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Roger that.

709
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,200
<i>Where am I going
to find $2,500?</i>

710
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,200
Charles.

711
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,200
Hey, my man.

712
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Looking well
as usual.

713
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,800
Oh, my, and that... that scent.

714
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,300
It's like the beach
after the rains.

715
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,000
What do you call it?

716
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Deodorant.

717
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,900
What do you want?

718
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,100
I, uh... I need
to borrow some money

719
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,500
or your future
brother-in-I's gonna...

720
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,100
pluck me from head to toe.

721
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,600
- How much we talking?
- Um,

722
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,500
not too much.

723
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,100
$2,500?

724
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,100
Give or take.

725
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,000
You did good, babe.

726
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
<i>No kid had as much fun
as you did.</i>

727
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,900
UNKNOWN CALLER

728
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,200
What?

729
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Baby, I'm sorry,

730
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,700
but I got a perfect excuse
for what happened.

731
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,900
Well, I'd love
to hear all about it.

732
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,100
Some other time.

733
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
Just remember,
I did it all for you.

734
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,400
So touching.

735
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,700
Oh, so touching-
family reunion.

736
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,300
Now, where the hell
is my money?

737
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,500
I don't have it.

738
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,100
Well, then,
we have a real problem.

739
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,600
Don't give it
to him, honey.

740
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,900
If anything happens
to my father...

741
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,600
What, you will con me
out of more money?

742
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,900
No... I'll kill you.

743
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,600
Then, bring me what is mine,

744
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
and we won't
have a problem.

745
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,100
Okay?

746
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
I'll call you in an hour.

747
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,500
TRANSMISSION LOST

748
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,400
Thank you so
much for this.

749
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,300
Oh, yeah.

750
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,700
Do you mind?

751
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,400
Oh, I can't
know your PIN?

752
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,400
I'll give you mine if it
makes you feel better.

753
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,500
- There are some boundaries, Morgan. 
- Okay.

754
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,900
All right,
all right, I'm sorry.

755
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Oh, my God.

756
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,300
"Oh, my God," what?

757
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,800
Oh, you're broke,
right? It's okay.

758
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,300
Don't feel bad,
dude. You know what?

759
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,900
There are places
I could use some grooming,

760
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,000
SO, FORGET ABOUT IT.

761
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,300
ALANCE INQUIRY
CHECKING ACCOUNT
ACCOUNT BALANCE

762
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Hey, hey, Sarah.

763
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,700
Look, I hope this
isn't a mistake

764
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,500
and the CIA has decided
to compensate me

765
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
- for my numerous acts of heroism... 
- Later, Chuck.

766
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,300
but there happens to be
an extra- oh, I don't know-

767
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,400
$10 million in my ATM account.

768
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,600
What? Why would my father

769
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
- put the sheik's money in your account? 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

770
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,200
Again, we're not so sure that
this is coming from your father.

771
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm still clinging
to the compensation theory.

772
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,100
Leave it there.

773
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
You know, that's
not a bad idea.

774
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
It should earn a couple
thousand a day in interest.

775
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,400
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

776
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,600
It's personal.

777
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,300
Hey, hey.

778
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
- You seen Walker?
- Yeah, she just left

779
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,300
in a real big hurry
with two duffel bags

780
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,500
stuffed full of T-shirts
and some serious firepower.

781
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Where are you going?

782
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,700
It's personal.

783
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,000
Morgan.

784
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
- Morgan.
- Yeah, buddy.

785
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,300
Morgan, I'm gonna
loan you the money.

786
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,400
Oh, thank you.

787
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,000
First, I need to
borrow the De-Morgan.

788
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,800
It's an emergency.

789
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,100
Oh, absolutely, yeah,
yeah, yours, done.

790
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,100
What's up?

791
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,500
It's personal.

792
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,500
Treat her well, my friend.

793
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,300
That's close enough.

794
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,500
You have something for me?

795
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,000
Where's my father?

796
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,500
Hey.

797
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,100
Yeah.

798
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Nothing.

799
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,700
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

800
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,600
I have your money right here.

801
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,500
- Hey, no!
- Grab her gun!

802
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,300
Mr. Lichtenstein,
thank you for joining.

803
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,200
Here to sell me
the DeLorean?

804
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,300
I have your money, okay?

805
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,400
And I can wire it to you
right now.

806
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
If you're lying,

807
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,600
I will put a bullet in her head.

808
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,700
All I need
is your account number.

809
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,700
Please. We're just a couple
of bad con men

810
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,400
who got in way too deep.

811
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,700
All right? All we want to do
is give you your money back.

812
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,900
Come take it and let us go.

813
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,200
ACTIVE ACCOUNT
ENTER ACCOUNT#

814
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
The sheik's account number. Hmm.

815
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,900
Decent plan, Bartowski.

816
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,300
Of course
I'll never tell him that.

817
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,600
There. You have
your money.

818
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,200
Pleasure doing business.

819
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,000
Now kill them.

820
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,100
What?

821
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,100
OKAY.

822
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,600
Hold it right there!

823
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,000
U.S. Treasury.

824
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,800
Don't anybody move.

825
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,700
Send 'em up,
boys. I got him.

826
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,300
I got Lichtenstein.

827
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
- Come on.
- Oh!

828
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,400
Yeah.

829
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah, you're really...

830
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,600
You're really selling it there,
Casey.

831
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,500
Yeah.

832
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,400
Is this a joke?

833
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
Huh? Where's your backup?

834
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,200
Oh. I'm just the tip
of the spear.

835
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,100
Rest of the crew's
on their way up.

836
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,400
I've been following
these grifters for months now.

837
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
You know, if you gentlemen
would be willing

838
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,900
to testify, I'm sure

839
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,400
we can get the weapons
charges dropped, hmm?

840
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,200
Drop it!

841
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,300
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

842
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,000
You lower your weapon,
or I will kill your father.

843
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,700
If I did that to him,
imagine what I'll do to you.

844
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,200
Drop your weapon!

845
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,500
Oh!

846
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,800
Amad's getting away.

847
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,100
Not at 22 miles an hour
he's not.

848
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,100
All clear.

849
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Dad.

850
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,600
Hey.

851
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah, thanks.

852
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Little rough with
the cuffs, though.

853
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,700
Yeah. Call it in.

854
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,900
You didn't use blanks?

855
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,100
What's wrong
with you people?

856
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
It's just a flesh wound.

857
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,100
Yeah. Hi.

858
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,400
I'd like to report
a stolen '81 DeLorean.

859
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,200
License plate is
D- E-M-O-R-G-A-N.

860
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,400
???

861
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Thanks to your efforts,
we were able to freeze

862
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,400
nearly a billion dollars
of the sheik's foreign accounts.

863
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,300
Well done.

864
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,200
General.

865
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,800
Hmm.

866
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,600
Now, to the unpleasant news.

867
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,600
Agent Walker, we're sending
a unit to your hotel

868
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,100
to pick up your father
for the previous

869
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,400
embezzlement charge
at 5:00 today.

870
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,900
Say your good-byes.

871
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,700
- That's all.
- General?

872
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,400
As you know,
Mr. Burton was invaluable

873
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,800
in the seizure
of these funds.

874
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,100
Perhaps that could lessen
his prison sentence.

875
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,500
Prosecution will be made aware
of that.

876
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Thank you.

877
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,400
<i>You're not going
to believe this.</i>

878
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,700
The police just called.

879
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,300
The DeLorean was stolen.

880
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,700
Morgan, I've been meaning
to tell you...

881
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,900
Dude, do you know
what that means?

882
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,100
They have to impound the car.

883
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
I'm gonna get
Blue Book value.

884
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,600
I'll pay back Awesome,
and I'll still

885
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,300
have ten large!
Dude, I'm rich!

886
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,700
Aah! We're rich.

887
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Now, we can move in together
in style.

888
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,500
I am doing the whole living room
in shabby chic.

889
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Love you.

890
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,900
<i>Love you.</i>

891
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Oh. Kiss. Kiss. Oh. Mmm.

892
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,800
Yummy kisses.

893
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,500
Well, you have to grow
up sometime, you know?

894
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,700
The right girl, the right time.
I'm proud of you, buddy. Thank you.

895
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,000
Dude, you're not

896
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,800
gonna believe
what just showed up

897
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,600
in the Audio Install.

898
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,100
- Morgan, no!
- Yes.

899
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,800
- No.
- Yes.

900
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,600
DO NOT.

901
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,700
Well, it couldn't hurt

902
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,000
to look, you know...

903
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,200
FOR SALE

904
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,900
FOR SALE

905
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,000
Aah! Ooh!

906
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,100
Boy, lucky
you're a good shot.

907
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,600
But a good con man doesn't
need a gun, and he can leave...

908
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Leave town whenever he wants.

909
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,900
I know.

910
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,500
Uh, Dad, can you get
me some Rocky Road?

911
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,300
There's a store
around the corner.

912
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,500
Sure thing, darling.

913
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,000
Why did you put the
money in Chuck's account?

914
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,100
I needed to put it somewhere
'cause I didn't trust Cop Face.

915
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,300
But you trusted Chuck?

916
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,200
I read people.

917
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,700
That's the only
real talent I got.

918
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,100
One thing I know-

919
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,700
that kid would never betray you.

920
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,900
I made a $10 million bet
that he loved you.

921
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,400
Turns out I was right.

922
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,300
I'll be back in a minute.

923
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,100
Uh, Dad?

924
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
Can you make it a double scoop?

925
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,200
Sure, darling.

926
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,800
Hello, Charlie.

927
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
I've kind of grown accustomed
to Schnook.

928
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So have I.

929
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,000
I, uh... I wanted to
thank you for coming back

930
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,700
when I gave you ten
million reasons to leave.

931
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,500
But one really good reason
to stay.

932
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,200
And she would have done the same
for me.

933
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,800
Yeah, I believe she would have.

934
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,200
Lucky for me,
she met the right schnook.

935
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,200
He went over there...

936
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,900
My daughter is some
kind of cop, isn't she?

937
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,100
Yeah. Yeah.

938
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Something like that.

939
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,900
She turned out pretty good.

940
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,300
Even with a lousy father.

941
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Take care of her.

942
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,400
I'll do my best.

943
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,300
You okay?

944
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,400
I'm fine.

945
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,900
Here.

946
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,600
He'll be back soon.

947
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,300
No, he won't.

948
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:16,900
