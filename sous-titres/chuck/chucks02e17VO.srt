1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,716
Okay, I have to say this.
We should never do that again.

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,284
Mission's over, Chuck.
Plan went just fine.

3
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:14,614
Yeah, except that your plan
necessitated that we do actual plumbing.

4
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:17,599
And, for the record, none of
us knows how to actually plumb.

5
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,695
We're going to burn
these jumpsuits, right?

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,480
I second Chuck's motion.
No more plumbing on future missions.

7
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,772
What, are you going soft,
Walker, huh?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,056
It doesn't matter.
Beckman got the intel she wanted.

9
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:30,279
Bunch of nancies. Ew.

10
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:33,508
You need to change at Casey's?

11
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:35,368
Huh? Oh, no, thanks.

12
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,302
Actually, Ellie and Awesome are...
out of town looking for a wedding site.

13
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:41,827
So I'm good to shower
a couple hundred times.

14
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:43,966
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow?

15
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,881
Sarah, have you heard anything
from Beckman about Orion?

16
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:50,975
Uh, not yet.

17
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,219
These things take time.

18
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,309
Gotcha. Okay.

19
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,524
She gets how important it is,
though, right?

20
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,044
I mean, you know,
if we could find Orion, then maybe

21
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:04,730
I can get all these secrets out of
my head, and go back to my old life.

22
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:06,774
She gets it, Chuck.
We all do.

23
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,317
You want that, too, right?

24
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:11,193
Of course I do, Chuck.

25
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:13,698
- Of course. I mean, you deserve that.
- Great.

26
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:15,950
That's... that's great.

27
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,425
I mean, I've only seen that little bit
of Beckman's office behind her chair,

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,601
but I can only imagine she's got

29
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:24,882
a whole crack squad
of brilliant analysts

30
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,257
working hard trying to find
Orion in the next room.

31
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:30,970
Chuck, leave the search for Orion up
to the team of brilliant analysts.

32
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,085
You need to get some sleep.

33
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,755
Why are you on?

34
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:34,444
All clear.

35
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:36,265
Alert FULCRUM...

36
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,462
Orion's gone.

37
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:39,839
Ice.

38
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:42,476
He was just here.

39
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,039
Let's go.
Get the computer.

40
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,102
A drink?

41
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,387
It's been a hard
day for FULCRUM.

42
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,836
<i>Incoming!</i>
<i>Take cover!</i>

43
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,143
<i>Down, down!</i>
<i>Get down!</i>

44
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,402
Wh...? When did this happen?

45
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,817
During the night.

46
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,159
Look on the bright side.

47
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:17,238
We don't have to buy TP for,
like, years.

48
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,789
Why start now?

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,803
Oh, no.
They defiled our home here.

50
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:24,495
- This is our castle.
- Why would someone do this?

51
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,816
- Who could do this?
- Finally!

52
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:30,135
Someone tried
to clean up this store.

53
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:31,885
Barclay.

54
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,972
Assistant Manager Barclay.
Beverly Hills Branch.

55
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,007
Or, for you, "sir."

56
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,822
I should have brought my resume.
Ouch.

57
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:42,972
So, Bar-clay,
you guys did this, huh?

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,791
Clever trick, Bartowski.
We admit nothing.

59
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,929
Although, we are in Burbank.
That should be a crime.

60
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,365
- I know, I know.
- Okay, Sir Barclay,

61
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,074
hypothetically speaking,
why would someone like yourself

62
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,204
and your incredibly colorful
and well-coordinated

63
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,474
team do this to our store?

64
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,989
- I know why.
- Hello, Michael.

65
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:05,578
Emmett.

66
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:06,767
Barclay.

67
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:09,665
You see, Barclay here is upset
that we're getting the new

68
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,698
Roark Instruments laptop
before they do.

69
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:15,728
We're getting the R7 gaming laptop
first? No one has even seen it yet.

70
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:18,193
- Bet your britches.
- We're the flagship store.

71
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:20,822
- We should get those computers.
- Flagship of my ass.

72
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:22,700
Now get out of here, Barclay.

73
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,137
You think Morgan over there is tough?
Wait till you see this guy.

74
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,977
- How was that, Michael?
- We got to work on that growl.

75
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:36,077
- Uh, sir, what are we going to do?
- I tell you what we could do.

76
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,821
We could assemble a counterstrike.
All right, all I need is a couple kegs

77
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,372
- of Silly String, and maybe...
- No retaliations.

78
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,830
Calm and collected.
That's the Buy More way.

79
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:46,208
Now, clean this place up!

80
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,758
You feeling okay, computer?

81
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,680
I know your secret.

82
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,786
Yeah, okay.
Who's doing this?

83
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,715
Your cleverness has been noted.

84
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,806
You're the Intersect.

85
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:24,987
We have to meet.

86
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,035
Why are we meeting?

87
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:30,575
Because I'm Orion.

88
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:34,959
You can hear me?

89
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,217
The computer is not
secure for long.

90
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:41,121
I'm sending one of mine
to your current location.

91
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,463
What? Hello?

92
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,703
- Hello?
- Hey, Chuck!

93
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:52,349
Hi. Hi. Hi, Sarah.

94
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:53,978
What was it?

95
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:55,097
Um...

96
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,234
There's something that
I should probably tell you.

97
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,820
What?
What did you say?

98
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,141
I found him.

99
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,614
I found Orion.

100
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:07,825
Or, actually, he found me

101
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,676
about ten minutes ago
in the Buy More.

102
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,992
He tapped into one of
the Nerd Herd computers using,

103
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:13,832
I might add,
a very cool kind of hack.

104
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,818
Chuck.

105
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,667
How is that possible?

106
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,487
I... I It probably has something
to do with my search.

107
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:24,425
<i>Your</i> what?

108
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,220
Chuck put together everything
he knew about FULCRUM and Orion,

109
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,680
and then he built an
automated Web search.

110
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,724
I think I hit
one of his security nets.

111
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,047
That's not how this works, Bartowski.
You don't conduct your own operations.

112
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,940
What did he say?
Orion.

113
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:39,276
Well, he knows I'm the Intersect.

114
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,692
And he's going
to send me a computer.

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,804
Where's the computer going?

116
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:44,781
To me.

117
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:48,085
I... I think. I don't... We didn't
really nail down the details.

118
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,444
I want that computer
under lock and key.

119
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,286
Orion's computers are nextgen,

120
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,401
capable of overriding
military defenses,

121
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:56,682
even hijacking
computerized weaponry.

122
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,168
God help us if it falls
into the wrong hands.

123
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,814
Delivery for Charles I. Bartowski.

124
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,181
What is it?

125
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,222
Says electronics.
A computer?

126
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:13,974
The Roark 7.

127
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:16,403
Take that, Beverly Hills.

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,607
I'm Chuck.

129
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:23,989
You just leave it with me.

130
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,034
Thanks.

134
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:16,932
Nothing.

135
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:19,503
Orion hasn't delivered the computer yet.
Do you think he's going

136
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:22,047
- to bring it personally?
- No, he's going to stay away for now.

137
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:23,669
Got it. Cool.
So we wait.

138
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:26,799
Why didn't you tell me?

139
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,588
Chuck, your search for Orion
was a rogue operation.

140
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,579
Do you know how dangerous that is?

141
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,094
Very.

142
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,591
And I didn't tell you.

143
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:39,309
And you didn't tell me.

144
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:42,479
Okay, you're right.
Completely and totally right.

145
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,665
But, Sarah, I want to get this thing
out of my head so I can go back

146
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,088
to my old life and have a chance
at a real relationship.

147
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:51,176
Do you really think the NSA and the CIA
are going to be cool with that?

148
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,069
You should have trusted me.

149
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:01,078
- Dude, what am I doing here?
- Come on. It's in Jeff's office.

150
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:04,482
- Wait. No, no, no. Jeff's office?
- Don't worry. You got to see this.

151
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,975
No, you don't understand.
I don't want to go into Jeff's office.

152
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,299
- It makes me feel... uncomfortable.
- I know. Morgan, it's that good.

153
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,566
Come on in.

154
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,484
Long time no see, Morgan.

155
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:24,356
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Wait.

156
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,115
Look at this.

157
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:33,069
What is it?

158
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:35,035
It's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

159
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,024
Liquid cooled, titanium housing,
over-clocked processor.

160
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,662
Gentlemen, this is a work of art.

161
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,374
We're trying it out before
we give it to Big Mike.

162
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,084
You're here in case we get caught.

163
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,192
Yeah, we figure Big Mike won't
come down too hard on his boy.

164
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:50,275
Thanks.

165
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:01,558
Whoa, whoa, close it, close it.
Big Mike will know that we turned it on.

166
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,146
No, just say you can't identify.

167
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,766
- Should I?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,348
Uh, yeah, you better believe it.

169
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:20,890
It's a simulator game.

170
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,663
Who should we target?

171
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,416
Buy More.

172
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,042
Orion has taken control

173
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,348
of a Predator drone
based out of Edwards.

174
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,460
Signal matches one
he used in Hong Kong.

175
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,234
Drone was on an armed targeting run.

176
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,456
- Is there a target?
- Please don't say Buy More.

177
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:57,590
Orion sent you a computer all right.
It's inside a Predator drone targeted

178
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:59,366
to kill you.
How thoughtful.

179
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,823
Why would he...

180
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:03,191
There's no time. We got to get
everybody out of the store.

181
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:06,175
Fire alarm. Okay, Chuck, you
stay here and monitor the drone.

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,792
Boredom.

183
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:17,080
Feels like we're flying
an actual Predator.

184
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:19,553
- I give it three stars.
- Three stars? You're a cretin.

185
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,433
The details are incredible. The graphics
processor must be running on...

186
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,580
Hold on a second. Why are we trying
to blow up our own store here?

187
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,859
Shouldn't we be targeting
a certain Beverly Hills location?

188
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:46,729
Guys, guys, wait.

189
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,010
- The drone is changing direction.
- Where's it heading?

190
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:53,625
Telemetry puts it at the corner
of Wilshire and Doheny.

191
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,796
That's the Beverly Hills Buy More.

192
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,535
Why would Orion
target another store?

193
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,584
He wouldn't.

194
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,105
But I know who would.

195
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,056
Look for Morgan.
I'm on my way.

196
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,006
Morgan, call me
as soon as you get this.

197
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,218
Don't think, just hit the callback
button right now.

198
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:17,425
No sign of Morgan,
Jeff or Lester. Those morons have

199
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,076
the computer, don't they?
Which one dies first?

200
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,804
Look, just go-go-go check

201
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:24,409
the loading dock, and I'll look
somewhere else. Go, now!

202
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,578
Hold on a second, guys.

203
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,816
It's Chuck again.

204
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,666
Don't answer it;
he's after my computer.

205
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,446
Yeah, but he's called twice; he never
does that. It could be an emergency.

206
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,216
- Why he'd call me, I have no idea.
- No! Morgan, no.

207
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,123
- Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, hey. Where are you?

208
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:40,083
Uh, with Lester in Jeff's office.
It's actually very nice.

209
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,422
Morgan, you have to listen to me.
You have to stop playing

210
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:44,483
- with that computer right now.
- Uh, why, Chuck?

211
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:46,453
Buddy, just trust me and do it!

212
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,680
- Yeah, sure, Chuck.
- We are almost at Beverly Hills.

213
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:50,331
Time to pull the plug, all right?

214
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,545
- Jig is up. Jeff stop him. Yes!
- Really?

215
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,920
Chuck is our leader!

216
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,189
No, he is your leader
for some weird reason!

217
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:58,581
Ah! You hurt me!

218
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,447
Give it to me, Lester!

219
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,012
No, no, no!

220
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:06,743
Chuck, you stop!

221
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,647
You stop right there!

222
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:19,890
That really hurt.

223
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,001
- I want just one of them!
- No.

224
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:24,036
Sarah,...

225
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,918
you're in the little boys' room.

226
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,644
What the living heck
is going on here?

227
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,889
Is that it?

228
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,565
Is that the Roark 7?

229
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,276
- No, uh, actually, this is...
- Yes it is, sir.

230
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,051
We wanted to take a closer look at it.
I figured it'd be okay.

231
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,705
It's my fault.
Crazy me.

232
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,242
Nobody touches this computer
until it goes on display tomorrow.

233
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,322
We are being watched, people!

234
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,788
We can't screw this up!

235
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,248
Calm and collected.

236
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,680
<i>Calm and collected.</i>

237
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,212
Such ne'er-do-wells we have here.

238
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,020
Emmett, I want you
to stand guard tonight.

239
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:05,075
Nobody gets close
to this laptop, got it?

240
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:06,720
Affirmative, Michael.

241
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,708
Barclay and the Beverly Hills boys
will be gunning for it.

242
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,807
I want that computer back, Jeffrey.

243
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,046
It's calling me, and I must

244
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,791
- have it.
- An after-hours job.

245
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,315
No problem.

246
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,904
So I guess we know
what our mission is:

247
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,836
rob the Buy More.

248
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,461
Tonight, after the store closes.

249
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:31,286
At least nobody else
knows it's here.

250
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:35,942
Welcome, Vincent.

251
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,970
It's good to see you survived
the Hong Kong incident.

252
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,627
We found Orion.

253
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:45,262
Picked up a signal matching the
computer he used in Hong Kong.

254
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,885
It originated from a retail
store in Burbank, California.

255
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,847
Is it a Buy More store?

256
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:52,740
Yes, it is.

257
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:56,330
Would you like me
to pick something up for you?

258
00:14:56,455 --> 00:15:00,007
FULCRUM has lost operatives there.
We believe it's a CIA substation.

259
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,263
The risk is too
great for an operation.

260
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:03,728
Sir, madam,...

261
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:05,717
you know me.

262
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:07,326
I can't let this go.

263
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,918
If I don't have your support,
I'll do it myself.

264
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,898
Then proceed, Vincent.

265
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,235
We appreciate your initiative.

266
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,260
It was a lawless town,

267
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,735
Shane, Marshal Dillon,
Clint Eastwood.

268
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,290
Little girls in comparison

269
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,025
to Milbarge.

270
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:36,956
Oh, God.

271
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,575
Okay, what's the plan?

272
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,921
You got us into this mess, why don't
you come up with the plan for once.

273
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:55,495
Okay. All right.

274
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,456
You two distract Emmett
with your super spy skills

275
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:00,041
while I go hit Big Mike's office.

276
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,192
He keeps the combination
of the safe in his desk.

277
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,884
Keeps the combination in his office?

278
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:05,549
It's a Buy More, Casey. Relax.

279
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,883
Oh, no, no, no, no.

280
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,157
There are no guns in my plan.
Okay? As annoying as Emmett is,

281
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:15,432
you cannot shoot, tranq,
or karate chop him in any way.

282
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,118
You put him in charge.

283
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:19,166
All right.

284
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:21,794
Let's go.

285
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,195
Hello?

286
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:33,366
Ooh, that better not be a rat.

287
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:44,669
I'm hearing things.

288
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,088
Just like Fresno.
Just like Fresno.

289
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,368
He's gonna find us.
We're gonna get fired.

290
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:02,026
I'll be turning tricks again
by the end of the week.

291
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,359
- I can throw my voice.
- A diversion, good idea. Go, go, go.

292
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,547
Caw-caw.

293
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,413
Oh, my God, what was that?

294
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:14,767
Did... did you throw your voice?

295
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:15,700
I think.

296
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,487
Seven hours to go.

297
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,204
I almost got it, Casey.

298
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,903
<i>I'm in the office.</i>

299
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,819
Way to go, Jeffrey.

300
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:32,330
So throwing your voice really
turned out great, didn't it? Huh?

301
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,825
What other tricks do you know?
When you saw a woman in half,

302
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,800
do you actually saw her in half?

303
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:42,294
Listen, I thought I lost you.

304
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:44,525
I'm scared, man.

305
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,615
I think I wet my pants.

306
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,191
Just a little.

307
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:23,893
Ha.

308
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,803
Ha. What are the chances?

309
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:28,273
Two burglars robbing the same place?

310
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,108
What a funny coincidence.

311
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,424
Hilarious.

312
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,153
Give me the computer.

313
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,823
We got to get out of here.
Lester, come on.

314
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,955
Let's go.

315
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,847
I've tried to help you
over the years, Jefferson.

316
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,118
I've drowned myself
trying to help you.

317
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,461
But you're a moron.
In the end, that's what you are.

318
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,004
You're a Buy Moron.

319
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,317
Do you get that?
Do you?

320
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:54,390
Lester.

321
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,444
Hang on a sec, Jeff,
I just got to...

322
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,130
Hi.

323
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,149
Who are you?

324
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:05,188
Run! Run! Run!

325
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,048
Die, intruders!

326
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,190
Die!

327
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,483
Mother! Mother!

328
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,363
- Mother?! Mother?!
- That's right.

329
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:15,591
Nobody messes with this Buy More.

330
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:16,613
Nobody.

331
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,216
You want to mess with me
and my store?

332
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,642
Well, bring it on, bitches!

333
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,624
- That felt good.
- Casey!

334
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:30,084
- I had to that.
- Guys.

335
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,631
You get one chance.

336
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:36,132
Drop your guns.

337
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,565
Um, sir, they don't have any guns.

338
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,758
I personally put this mission together,
and I forbade them from packing.

339
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,223
Why would you do that?

340
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,075
I don't know.
I just, you know...

341
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,011
I think that guns
make things too easy,

342
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,997
and I like my spies to be tough.

343
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,231
Look, you're not gonna
shoot anyone, right?

344
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:54,825
It would be unprofessional not to.

345
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:00,701
You had a gun?!

346
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:03,621
- I always have a gun.
- Don't you dare move.

347
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:06,507
Guys...

348
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,158
I... I really didn't need
to see that.

349
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:20,257
Oh, sweet Bolonia.

350
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:23,840
Who's your Big Mike?
Who's your Big Mike?

351
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:32,897
I'm busy, Emmett. What?!

352
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,301
Okay, be right there.

353
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,770
Morgan! Wake up!

354
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,009
We got trouble at the store!
Beverly Hills made their move!

355
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:43,888
Oh, thank God.

356
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:47,765
I contacted Langley.

357
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,144
They'll send a team to dispose
of the body tomorrow.

358
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,011
Guys, I don't understand. That was
supposed to be the easiest mission ever.

359
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,014
- How did a FULCRUM agent show up?
- How did he know the computer was there?

360
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:58,405
- Who else knows about it?
- All right, well, we got plenty

361
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,573
of scary questions,
now let's get some answers.

362
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,608
Don't touch that computer.

363
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,388
- Why?
- You weren't contacted by Orion.

364
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:08,828
Uh, what? Wait, wait.
He knew that I was the Intersect.

365
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:11,477
- Who else could possibly know that?
- FULCRUM.

366
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,314
My analysts believe
you walked into a FULCRUM trap.

367
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,154
Are you certain?

368
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,536
- I didn't think...
- No, you didn't think. None of you did.

369
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,939
And you put this entire
operation in jeopardy.

370
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:24,320
But, General, if it's Orion, this laptop
is the only way for us to contact him.

371
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:25,954
- Major.
- If I could just...

372
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,709
We can't take that risk.

373
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,097
My NSA technicians
will inspect the computer.

374
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:32,359
Sarah, please.

375
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:37,670
I'm... I'm sorry, Chuck.

376
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:39,088
Orders.

377
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,739
General, we don't have time to send this
computer off to Washington and wait.

378
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:46,573
If this really is Orion,
he may not contact us again.

379
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:48,793
You're right, we don't have time.

380
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:51,434
That's why I'm taking over
this operation directly.

381
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,937
I'll be on site within the hour.

382
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,367
What? You're coming here?

383
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:57,565
Hopefully I won't have
to shut down Operation

384
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,128
Bartowski because
of one foolish mistake,

385
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,881
but if FULCRUM knows
who you really are,

386
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:04,530
pack your bags, Chuck.

387
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,179
You're leaving with me.

388
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,409
Tell your family and friends...

389
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,329
Tell them nothing.

390
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:18,878
General, I implore you.

391
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,381
Don't use "implore." Only use words
that you actually use.

392
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,092
Here's why I think
that Orion is legit.

393
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,969
- I don't say "legit."
- Chuck.

394
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,632
- Is Beckman here?
- Uh, she's on her way.

395
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:30,682
- What about the computer?
- It's inside Castle.

396
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,142
Beckman has a containment unit
en route to move it out.

397
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,471
Guys, look, I am certain that
Orion is not FULCRUM, okay?

398
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:39,155
This is the real guy. If I could just
get five to 45 minutes with her,

399
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,921
- I could convince the General.
- No, she doesn't want to see you.

400
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:43,611
Please just wait in your room.

401
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:46,698
<i>Secure the perimeter.</i>

402
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,992
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about my search, but...

403
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,353
It's okay.
I'll explain it to her.

404
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:52,495
Now, go.

405
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,453
<i>All clear.</i>

406
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,797
Is the asset secure?

407
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:08,534
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:11,077
It was a highly
professional team, Michael.

409
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:13,757
There must have been 30...
40 of them.

410
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:15,656
They stormed the store.

411
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,379
And they took the new laptop.

412
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,211
What do you think?
Barclay?

413
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,470
Whoever did this broke
some serious laws here, boss.

414
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:26,050
It's Barclay, all right.
I can smell him all over this.

415
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,934
Hey! We came as soon as we heard.

416
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:29,947
Heard what?
Nobody called you.

417
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,494
Correct. Bingo. Yeah, no,
they closed the tap at Benny's,

418
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,664
saw the commotion,
wanted to see what was going on.

419
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,926
- I'm calling the police.
- Put that phone down.

420
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:38,862
Oh, God.

421
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:40,711
We can't let them
get away with this.

422
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,356
Okay, we can't be calm
and collected this time.

423
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:46,380
Let me see it.

424
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,432
No, Morgan.

425
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:55,568
We will remain calm and collected.

426
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,727
We will be calm and collected

427
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,782
when we go to Beverly Hills tonight

428
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,615
and we will be calm and collected

429
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,928
when I use my manager's
code to get into the store.

430
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,869
And then we will be
calm and collected when

431
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:09,876
we burn that mother loving
store to the ground.

432
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,730
- Sir, what exactly are we doing here?
- Payback.

433
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:27,786
I see.

434
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,217
Does payback involve
illegal activities?

435
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:31,587
Damn well better.

436
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,034
Wake up Chuck...

437
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,439
Hello, this is Chuck speaking.

438
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:53,790
<i>Hello, Chuck.</i>
<i>Where's my computer?</i>

439
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:55,496
Orion... Orion?

440
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,246
Um... uh, unfortunately,
your computer

441
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,463
is currently locked up in a
top secret government facility.

442
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:03,917
<i>- You have to get it.</i>
- I can't. My handlers think

443
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:06,983
that you're FULCRUM, and to be perfectly
honest, I'm on the fence myself.

444
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:08,156
<i>I'm not FULCRUM.</i>

445
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:09,523
Thanks.

446
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:12,158
Thanks, I'm glad we cleared that up,
but how can I be certain?

447
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:13,761
<i>Look at your computer.</i>

448
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:28,454
How did you know
that was in the Intersect?

449
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,777
<i>I put it there.</i>

450
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,447
<i>A long time ago.</i>

451
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,621
You really are Orion.

452
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,538
Wake up, Casey.
The '80s are over.

453
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:42,985
I lied to Chuck earlier.

454
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:45,088
He's done what no one else could do.

455
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,219
He found him.

456
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,712
Chuck found Orion.

457
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,213
General, why lie to him?

458
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,258
Orion is extremely important
to this project and to Chuck.

459
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,655
Important?

460
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:57,138
Don't think for a second that you can
tell me what is important, Agent Walker.

461
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,140
I've had an army of
analysts and spies

462
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,265
hunting for Orion since before
you were in a training bra.

463
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:05,574
After the first Cipher
was completed,

464
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,605
Orion purged his personal
records and disappeared.

465
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,484
We've been looking for him
ever since.

466
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:11,853
So has FULCRUM.

467
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:14,530
Neither of us has been able
to lay a hand on him.

468
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:15,863
Until now.

469
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,071
Until Bartowski.

470
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:21,412
<i>You need to go.</i>

471
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,902
No, look, I have to tell Sarah
and Casey what you just did.

472
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:26,526
It's proof that you're Orion.
And, on another note,

473
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,753
I've got a small convention
of agents gathered in

474
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,976
my courtyard, and my team
is in a high-level meeting.

475
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:32,237
<i>You can't trust them.</i>

476
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:34,911
Who, Sarah and Casey?
They save my life on a regular basis.

477
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:36,499
<i>Go to your computer.</i>

478
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,852
So, we're dealing with the real Orion.
How dangerous is he?

479
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,990
<i>When FULCRUM made a</i>
<i>move on him in Hong Kong,</i>

480
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:50,162
he nearly destroyed an entire
building with a stolen Predator.

481
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,984
Beckman is tiny.

482
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,071
<i>General, what if Orion</i>
<i>can help Chuck</i>

483
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,239
<i>remove the Intersect,</i>
<i>erase it from his mind?</i>

484
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,592
Yeah, yeah.
Good question, Sarah.

485
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,455
<i>That's exactly what I don't want.</i>

486
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,086
<i>Chuck Bartowski is absolutely vital</i>
<i>to national security.</i>

487
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,666
<i>He can never meet Orion.</i>

488
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,793
Do you understand that,
Agent Walker?

489
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:12,708
Yes.

490
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,849
<i>What?</i>

491
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:16,510
Sarah, no.

492
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,679
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

493
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:23,832
<i>You have 40 seconds to exit.</i>

494
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:25,582
<i>Their surveillance is down.</i>

495
00:27:25,707 --> 00:27:27,173
What about the agents?

496
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,628
<i>Leave the watch.</i>
<i>Go now.</i>

497
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:09,841
Identify.

498
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:11,661
Hold very still.

499
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,927
What's happening?

500
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:15,142
Hold still.

501
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,698
Uh... that's good.
Who did you think I was?

502
00:28:22,353 --> 00:28:25,076
<i>I'm sorry, I had to make</i>
<i>certain this wasn't a trap.</i>

503
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,982
- Orion.
<i>- Hello, Chuck.</i>

504
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:29,790
<i>It's good to finally see you</i>
<i>face-to-face.</i>

505
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,876
Yeah.
Yeah, same here.

506
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,552
- Can I... can I ask you a question?
<i>- Of course.</i>

507
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,721
The Intersect
that's in my head right now...

508
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,521
<i>You want to get it out, don't you?</i>

509
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:47,571
Yes, yes, I very much do.

510
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,190
<i>- We need to meet first.</i>
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

511
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,276
- My calendar is pretty wide open.
<i>- When can we meet tonight?</i>

512
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,236
- Tonight?
<i>- I'm in Los Angeles.</i>

513
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,254
<i>We have much to discuss</i>
<i>meet me here in an hour.</i>

514
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,206
<i>Orion out.</i>

515
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,044
Okay.

516
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,764
Chuck out.

517
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,509
Don't scream.

518
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,583
I have a splitting headache.

519
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:18,172
You're... you're not dead.

520
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,450
A modified poison
extracted from blowfish.

521
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:29,934
FULCRUM agents are taught
to survive its near-death state.

522
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,019
That sounds like a fun class.

523
00:29:32,652 --> 00:29:33,863
Not really.

524
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:35,606
Now...

525
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:38,943
I need you to do exactly as I say.

526
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,813
- Stand up.
- Stand up... I'm standing.

527
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,508
Sorry, sorry.

528
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:49,729
Let's go.

529
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,103
I don't care what
Bartowski thinks he wants.

530
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:55,017
<i>- I want Orion.</i>
- General.

531
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:56,715
What is it, Walker?

532
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,668
I need to say something.

533
00:29:59,037 --> 00:30:00,965
Chuck Bartowski has risked his life

534
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,528
for this country.

535
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,386
But he's not a spy, and he knows it.

536
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,304
He's a spy until I say he isn't.

537
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,658
General, Chuck knows
that Orion is out there,

538
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:13,062
and he is not going to just sit in
his room and do what we say. He...

539
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,064
- What is it?
- Where is Chuck?

540
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,064
- The watch has him in his room.
- No, this is Chuck we're talking about.

541
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:28,531
He would have come up with some
excuse to come in here and meet

542
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:30,560
- the general in person. Check his room.
- What?

543
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:33,339
Walker's right.
Chuck's a social butterfly by nature.

544
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:35,416
Checking the Castle.

545
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:47,173
No, wait, wait, wait, run the tape back.
There's got to be something else.

546
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:49,335
Chuck would leave us a clue or something

547
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:17,720
Okay.

548
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:20,377
I shut off the security cameras.

549
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:21,954
We're clear.

550
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:23,443
My God.

551
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,382
It's beautiful.

552
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,641
Oh, it's so clean

553
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,326
and fresh, like...

554
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,596
- Douches.
- Oh, my God.

555
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:40,078
You know what we'll do?

556
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:42,281
We'll draw little funny faces
on them. How about that?

557
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:43,223
Nope.

558
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,319
- What's that?
- My fiddle.

559
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,946
We're going to play music?

560
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,406
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, hold on a second.

561
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,283
Wait, wait...
stand by here, everybody.

562
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,981
Can I have a moment of your time?

563
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:55,616
If we could just, uh, talk about
what's about to happen here,

564
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:59,114
okay, and see what emotions
start bubbling up, and... talk.

565
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:01,588
You and I will talk.
We'll just talk it out.

566
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,764
This isn't you, sir.

567
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:06,759
They hit one of my men.

568
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,593
Then, let Emmett
have the bat, all right?

569
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,452
Let him take his revenge
out on the store.

570
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:12,337
That... that sounds vaguely sane.

571
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:13,286
Here.

572
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:15,391
I can be destructive.

573
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:21,930
All right! So...

574
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,553
What to hit first?

575
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,101
How about that?

576
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,576
All right, one more time.

577
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:35,458
With feeling.

578
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:53,235
Oh, God.

579
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,550
Okay, team...

580
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,451
We should run now.

581
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:05,092
- <i>Viva la</i> Buy More!
- Burbank style!

582
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,781
How long have you known Orion?

583
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:15,409
I don't really know him.

584
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:17,455
You're CIA, right?

585
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,716
Sure.

586
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:21,040
Name's Carmichael.

587
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,617
I've heard of you.

588
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:25,446
Orion was coming out
of the cold for you.

589
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,046
That's excellent work.

590
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,133
I've been after him for three years.

591
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:31,550
What's your secret?

592
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,297
<i>Someone's approaching from the east.</i>

593
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:37,598
I need you to stand by the window

594
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,556
so Orion can see you.

595
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:59,480
Tell him it's safe.

596
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:03,727
Tell him it's safe.

597
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:16,970
It's safe.

598
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,065
Downstairs.

599
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,059
Take him!

600
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,534
Run...

601
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,434
Take him to the roof.
Chopper's on the way.

602
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,214
On behalf of FULCRUM,

603
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,842
I'd like to thank you,
Agent Carmichael.

604
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,851
I wish I could give
you a proper reward.

605
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:08,464
But, fortunately,
I have to shoot you.

606
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,974
It would be unprofessional not to.

607
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,875
No, no, they have Orion!
They're gonna take him to the roof!

608
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,219
- No, we're not...
- I can save him!

609
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:38,570
No!

610
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,938
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

611
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:55,806
Yes, General, I read you.

612
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,494
We have to get outta here.
A Predator's heading toward us.

613
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:02,964
- He's trying to take himself out.
- Chuck, we have to go now.

614
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:05,654
No, no, I can do this.
I can reprogram the Predator.

615
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,370
Come on!

616
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:17,552
- We are leaving, Chuck.
- No! No, no, no, I have to do this.

617
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:19,505
- He can't die!
- Chuck, you can't save him.

618
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,428
Okay, you can't fix this one.

619
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:43,254
It's better that Orion didn't
fall into FULCRUM's hands.

620
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:44,900
He knew what they would do to him.

621
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:46,620
He knew what they would gain.

622
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,935
General, you don't want the Intersect
out of my head, do you?

623
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,627
No, I don't.

624
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,798
Ma'am, Chuck has done everything
that we've asked of him.

625
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,054
Agent Walker,
you want to protect him.

626
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,677
But playtime is over.

627
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,929
Chuck, I hesitate to say this.

628
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,181
Please, please, hesitate.

629
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:09,226
We are in the midst
of a secret war with FULCRUM.

630
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,680
And I believe the
outcome of this fight

631
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:14,336
will rest squarely
on your shoulders.

632
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,775
- Oy.
- No, listen to the man.

633
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,986
He's right.
I'm no spy.

634
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,557
Do you know how many agents
I've lost to FULCRUM?

635
00:37:21,682 --> 00:37:24,848
How powerful they are?
Only this operation,

636
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:27,660
only <i>you</i> have found
a hole in their armor.

637
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:30,191
See, I can't lose you, Chuck.

638
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:31,645
I need you.

639
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,251
It's time for you to become a spy.

640
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,088
- Yes!
- Yes!

641
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:40,021
- Yes!
- Yes!

642
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,421
Love the smell of Burbank
in the morning!

643
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:45,394
Smells like victory!

644
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,611
Hey!

645
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:48,223
We know what you did.

646
00:37:50,397 --> 00:37:51,709
Well, do you now?

647
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,533
You went too far, Michael.

648
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:55,689
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, you won't.

649
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:57,824
It ain't the Buy More way.

650
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,883
- What?
- You know the rules.

651
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:02,432
They cut their prices by 10%,

652
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:03,906
we cut ours 15.

653
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,185
They give away toasters,
we give away microwaves.

654
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:09,620
They put their hands on one of ours,

655
00:38:09,898 --> 00:38:12,148
we find their
assistant manager and...

656
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:16,402
You get the picture, don't you?

657
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,413
We're leaving. But...

658
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:26,509
speaking for my store

659
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:29,097
and the city of
Beverly Hills as a whole,

660
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,642
we do not approve of your methods.

661
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,533
Well, you're not from Burbank.

662
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,262
Thanks for stopping me back there.

663
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:47,377
The store doesn't need any more
trouble than it's already got.

664
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,034
What is it, sir?

665
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,998
Rumors mostly.

666
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:54,992
There's been some talk about
a store in the area closing.

667
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:57,459
People being fired...
Times are tough.

668
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:58,764
Sure, yeah.

669
00:39:00,364 --> 00:39:02,426
We can't let that happen.

670
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:04,851
Don't worry, son.

671
00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:07,322
We won't.

672
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,740
<i>If you're watching this, Chuck,</i>
<i>it means something happened to me.</i>

673
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:44,673
<i>Probably something not so nice.</i>

674
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,631
<i>Well, I hope we were able to meet,</i>

675
00:39:46,756 --> 00:39:48,927
<i>I hope I was able</i>
<i>to tell you my real name.</i>

676
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:52,452
<i>The cards you're looking at are</i>
<i>the schematics for the new Intersect.</i>

677
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:55,250
<i>I stole them from FULCRUM.</i>
<i>Show them to no one,</i>

678
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:57,076
<i>but study them.</i>

679
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,410
<i>You will need to</i>
<i>understand that computer</i>

680
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:01,939
<i>if you want to get the</i>
<i>Intersect out of your head.</i>

681
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:03,659
<i>And yes, it's possible.</i>

682
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,819
<i>If you can find FULCRUM's Intersect,</i>

683
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:07,745
<i>if you can get inside,</i>

684
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:10,115
<i>you could get your old life back.</i>

685
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:11,803
<i>Good-bye, Chuck.</i>

686
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:14,119
<i>This disk will self destruct</i>

687
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,888
<i>in five seconds.</i>

688
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:18,744
<i>Always wanted to say that.</i>

689
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:27,760
Chuck? Hi.

690
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:32,054
She's wrong, you know.
I'm not a spy.

691
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:35,677
Look, Beckman is a soldier

692
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:37,967
and she see things
in black and white.

693
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:40,228
But she is right about one thing.

694
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,083
We're in the middle
of a fight with FULCRUM.

695
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:45,275
Yeah, uh...

696
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:48,100
I get that, I do.

697
00:40:48,743 --> 00:40:50,363
But this is not my future.

698
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:53,262
This is what I'm doing right now.

699
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:55,786
But I will get my life back.

700
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,788
Yeah, of course you will, Chuck.

701
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,094
We're still a good team, right?
You still trust us?

702
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,587
I trust you.

703
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,340
Of course I do.

704
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:10,383
I'm on your side, Chuck.

705
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,717
I know.

706
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,224
Well, I... I better go.

707
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:18,634
Yeah.

708
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:21,415
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm a little beat.

709
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,291
Okay.

710
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,412
Is Walker on board
with this mission, Major Casey?

711
00:41:30,537 --> 00:41:31,781
Yes, ma'am, 100%.

712
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,822
You have no reservations about
how she feels toward the asset?

713
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,159
No, ma'am.

714
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:39,079
I want everything you have
on her and Bartowski.

715
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:42,666
Video surveillance
and your unedited report.

716
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,042
Don't you trust me?

717
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:45,752
I don't trust anybody.
