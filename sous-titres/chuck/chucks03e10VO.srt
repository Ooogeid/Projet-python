1
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:03,799
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things</i>

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,266
<i>that you might need to know.
The Ring used me as a decoy.</i>

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,566
You said I was safe, bro.

4
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:07,400
Babe, we need to get away.

5
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:08,366
Where do you want to go?

6
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:10,267
Doctors Without Borders.

7
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:10,999
I'm a spy, buddy.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,567
My best friend is a spy?

9
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:15,534
This is the best news
I've ever heard!

10
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:29,167
Dismissed.

11
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:32,934
Lieutenant Alexander Coburn?

12
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,566
Thank you for your service,
Lieutenant,

13
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:38,832
but you have not qualified

14
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,367
for training with Special
Operations Command.

15
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,933
You'll be returning home
with your unit at 0800 tomorrow.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,900
Dismissed.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
Dismissed.

18
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,934
Tic Tac?

19
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,033
I'm sorry, Colonel?

20
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:06,967
I know it's silly,
but they remind me of home.

21
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,833
Go ahead and keep them.

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,800
I have a feeling you're
gonna be out here a while.

23
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:18,832
How would you feel if I told you

24
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,100
that there was a covert
black ops team

25
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,900
of America's finest snipers,
rangers and men

26
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:27,701
willing to do anything
to protect this country,

27
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,167
and that team wanted you?

28
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,401
I'd say that sounds
like a dream come true, sir.

29
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,900
And I'd say you have
quite a choice to make.

30
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:39,134
Either go home to your family

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,701
or you become the soldier
you always dreamed you could be.

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,434
So, tell me,
Lieutenant Coburn...

33
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:51,900
...are you ready to die today?

34
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:03,534
I'm glad you took my call.

35
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,501
In a matter of hours,
General Beckman

36
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,534
is gonna give you and your team
a Trace Cell Mission

37
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:10,900
to test the CIA's
security system.

38
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,734
I need you to pick something
up for me while you're there.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,867
I know you'll make
the right decision.

40
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:27,434
You always do.

41
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:40,967
02200 and... two.

42
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,034
Uh, p.m.

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,301
NSA Agent John Casey
in his apartment,

44
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,301
speaking to an
elderly gentleman.

45
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:53,401
And I detect
a hint of Midwestern...

46
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,634
I hear footsteps!

47
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:58,467
Coming in from behind me,
closer, closer now.

48
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:01,100
Whoever finds this video,
I want you to...

49
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,400
Oh, it's just you, Chuck.

50
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:06,601
I thought you were KGB,
maybe even a ninja.

51
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:08,266
Although in that case,

52
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,832
your footsteps would've been
a lot quieter, wouldn't they?

53
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,733
Probably.
Yeah.

54
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,133
What are you doing?

55
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:13,667
A little spy work.

56
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,166
I think Casey's getting a
mission. Want to listen?

57
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,100
First of all, if Casey
was getting a mission,

58
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,067
I would know about it because
I would be getting a mission.

59
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,932
And secondly, you're being kept
out of the loop for a reason.

60
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,367
Spy work is dangerous,
buddy. I can...

61
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,334
Ooh, ooh.

62
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,701
Pleasure working with you again,
old friend.

63
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,668
Working on what?

64
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,634
<i>Good morning, team.</i>

65
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:49,200
Your task this week
is a Trace Cell Mission.

66
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,733
Uh, excuse me, a Trace Cell?

67
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:52,500
It means spy-proofing
our own security.

68
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,467
The CIA's most valuable assets

69
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,634
are held in a subterranean vault
at our Los Angeles facility.

70
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,033
You'll need to break through

71
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,700
15 levels of security
to get there.

72
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,067
Will Shaw be joining us?

73
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:05,234
No, Shaw's in D.C.

74
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:07,133
Agent Walker,
you'll need to catch

75
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:08,566
a later flight to meet him.

76
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,200
You have your orders. Good luck.

77
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,600
This is just great.

78
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,900
So, now you're gonna
go meet Shaw in D.C.

79
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,167
Does everyone have a secret
mission within a mission?

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,966
It's not a mission, Chuck.

81
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,466
This time it's personal.

82
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,334
Oh, oh, right,
right, of course.

83
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,501
Well, that would make sense
why I was kept out of that loop.

84
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,267
My work is here, Chuck,
so, please, stay focused.

85
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,501
We are up against the best
security in the world tonight.

86
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,467
Our own.

87
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,167
That's the door to level two.

88
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:50,333
A hallway.

89
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:51,466
Well, seems easy enough.

90
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,367
Uh-uh.

91
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,433
Oh.

92
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,899
This is where
you flash.

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,199
Just relax, Chuck,
you've got time.

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,100
Nobody's banging down
on the door.

95
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:24,034
* *

96
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,500
Mission accomplished.

97
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:34,100
Pace yourself, Chuck,
we've got 14 more levels.

98
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,768
That was manageable.

99
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,199
Now, Walker,

100
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,301
watch the door.

101
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:55,734
Hey, uh, shouldn't
we stick together?

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,034
No, always gotta have
somebody watch your back.

103
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,300
I got yours.

104
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,201
The box we need
is around here.

105
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,833
There it is.

106
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,400
Did you just take something
out of that box?

107
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:53,668
No.

108
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:56,367
I literally just
watched you close it.

109
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,467
Hey, hey, look,
if you're working on

110
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,434
some secret side
mission, tell me.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,767
Breathe a word of this
to anyone,

112
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,333
you're as good
as a dead man, Bartowski.

113
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,234
You understand?

114
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,167
Is everything okay?

115
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,800
Yeah.

116
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:29,091
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

117
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,900
Chuck, hey.

118
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,633
I need you to do
me a solid, bro.

119
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:10,934
I need you to help Ellie commit
to Doctors Without Borders.

120
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,467
What?
I- I thought that she did.

121
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,434
Yeah, well, so did I,
but I think it all hit her today

122
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,200
that it meant leaving L.A.
and leaving you.

123
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,599
Now, she's
gonna come to you

124
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,500
and I need you to back
me up on this, bro.

125
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,332
That's probably her now.

126
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,168
Okay. Okay.

127
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:28,434
Is Devon here?

128
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:32,300
Chuck, I got it.

129
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,133
You-you got "it"?

130
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:37,534
What is it?
What is this?

131
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,300
Ellie, Ellie, this is amazing.
Oh, my God.

132
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,000
Neurology fellowship at USC?

133
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,366
You've wanted this since
you were in Middle School.

134
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,432
I know, I know.

135
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:48,633
But what do I do?

136
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,366
Doctors Without Borders
is the only thing

137
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,333
that Devon has been
excited about in weeks.

138
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,134
Yeah, well, you know,
sometimes your dream job

139
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,700
isn't always what you
expect it to be.

140
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,100
<i>Unfortunately, your mission</i>

141
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:06,867
at the CIA facility
was a day too late.

142
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:08,233
The vault had already
been compromised

143
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:11,001
and a new drug
called Laudanol was stolen.

144
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,801
Military scientists were able
to create a prototype pill

145
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,767
that could suppress emotions
in battlefield soldiers,

146
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:19,867
make them stronger,
faster, fearless.

147
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,499
Wait a minute,

148
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,633
no fear?

149
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:23,833
Could that help me flash?

150
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,267
Well, maybe, but then

151
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,367
you wouldn't feel
anything, Chuck.

152
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,433
Right, but I could work...

153
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,332
perfectly.

154
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,167
We'll never know
unless we get it back.

155
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:36,101
We think this might
have been an inside job.

156
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,766
Only a handful of our people
knew the Laudanol

157
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:40,867
was being kept in box 092407.

158
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,700
Oh, yes.

159
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,167
I get it now, you're good.

160
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,666
You are good, General.

161
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,567
You guys, you are good,
very good.

162
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,966
This is a test, right?

163
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,200
Bartowski.

164
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,599
First there was the solo
mission on the plane,

165
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,966
then turning an asset,

166
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,100
now this time it's,

167
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:57,101
"Chuck, will you
betray your country

168
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:59,000
"or will you turn in
your friend and partner,

169
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,766
John Casey,
for stealing the pill?"

170
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,734
I'll play ball, okay?

171
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,801
Guilty. He did it.

172
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:10,300
Are you positive
you saw Colonel Casey

173
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,300
take the pill, Mr. Bartowski?

174
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,333
Yeah.

175
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:19,134
No? No.

176
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:22,433
No, I would-I would actually
not use the word "positive."

177
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,101
It was very poorly lit
in that, um...

178
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:28,034
I- I'm wrong half the time.

179
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,667
Colonel Casey?
So...

180
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:32,634
Would you care to respond?

181
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hang on a second.

182
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:44,268
Let's just all take
a breath here, okay?

183
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,667
John Casey is one of the
most loyal spies out there.

184
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,700
He would never do anything
to jeopardize the CIA.

185
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,667
Casey, tell them!

186
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,667
With all due respect, General,

187
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,767
I will exercise my right
to remain silent

188
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,734
under the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution.

189
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,834
What?

190
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,134
What are you doing?

191
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,901
Agent Walker, please relieve
the colonel of his weapon.

192
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,034
John, you want to tell me
what's going on?

193
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,333
<i>Which is why I said
Left 4 Dead 2 would be better</i>

194
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,500
as an expansion pack...
I need your help.

195
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,033
The answer's yes.

196
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,067
<i>I already set the DVR to record
the Mork and Mindy marathon.</i>

197
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:54,599
This is not that.

198
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,500
This is, uh, this
spy related, okay?

199
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,201
Did you happen to record
Casey's conversation last night?

200
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:03,567
That would depend.

201
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,534
No, don't worry, don't worry,
you're not in trouble.

202
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,633
I actually need your help.

203
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,267
Oh, sweet.
I knew you'd come around, dude.

204
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,866
Yeah, sure, absolutely.

205
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:12,866
What do you need,
audio or video?

206
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:14,299
Whatever.

207
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,834
MORGAN
2100 and 43 p.m.

208
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,366
There's a chill in the air

209
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,267
and hint of vanilla.

210
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:27,467
A man enters
Casey's apartment.

211
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,633
Is that static?

212
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,534
Carrots actually.

213
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,801
I'm sorry. I get
hungry on a stakeout.

214
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:49,001
Holy crap. What is
it, Chuck? I want in.

215
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,666
You know what, Morgan?
Trust me, in this case,

216
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,667
the fewer details you know,
the better.

217
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,001
Call me if you need me.

218
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,233
Hey, show some respect.

219
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:11,700
This guy was one of the best
that we had. Sorry, ma'am.

220
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,667
Still no sign
of the Laudanol.

221
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,333
Sarah.

222
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:20,900
I just flashed.

223
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,033
Casey is being played.

224
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,399
His old commanding officer's

225
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,566
a guy named James Keller.

226
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:25,900
High up in special ops.

227
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:28,767
He's the guy who turned
Casey's former sensei,

228
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,967
because now
he's a member of the Ring.

229
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:32,700
What? Casey doesn't
know anything.

230
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,299
We got to talk to him
and tell him

231
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,633
who this Keller guy
really is.

232
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,167
We can't. Casey
committed treason.

233
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,866
And he's still
refusing to talk.

234
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,567
They're moving him to a
black site in Thailand-

235
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:44,300
outside of U.S. torture
jurisdictions. When?

236
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,900
Tomorrow morning.

237
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:49,201
Okay, then we've got
to break him out before then

238
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:51,801
and clear his name. If we do
this, and if we get caught,

239
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,033
we're gonna be tried
for treason,

240
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,533
and you're gonna
lose everything

241
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,001
and you're never going to get
a chance to be a real spy.

242
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,234
Is that what you want?

243
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,867
It's Casey.

244
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,367
You sure you're okay
missing your flight to D.C.?

245
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,066
Yeah, Shaw can wait,
Casey can't.

246
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,000
He's in a holding cell
on level 15.

247
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,733
Now all we have to do
is just break through

248
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:18,966
the security
we just spy-proofed.

249
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:20,266
Well, it's only
been 24 hours.

250
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,234
I'd be surprised
if they fixed anything.

251
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,667
All right then.

252
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:25,601
Time to save the day.

253
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,034
Chuck, are you okay?

254
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:43,167
Well, that wasn't
there before.

255
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:50,700
Alert the general.

256
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:52,701
We've captured
two infiltrators.

257
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,734
I see you've encountered
my new security measures.

258
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,734
Well done. Well done.

259
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,366
Yeah, really
excellent work.

260
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,199
You deserve a medal

261
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,667
for adjusting all these
security measures

262
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:08,767
so quickly.

263
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:09,866
Yes, General Beckman,

264
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,767
the spy-proofing
is excellent.

265
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:13,266
Who to thank?

266
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:16,634
Uh, Fitzroy.
Stanley Fitzroy.

267
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,300
It means "son of the king."

268
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,967
Did you get that,
General? Fitzroy?

269
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,932
Son of the king-
she knew that as well.

270
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:24,433
That's incredible.

271
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:26,300
Yeah, okay, great.

272
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,201
Uh, my name
is Charles Carmichael.

273
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,100
And this is my partner
Sarah Walker.

274
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,366
Uh, we're secure.

275
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,668
Please forgive
the intrusion

276
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,066
and condescending tone.

277
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,401
I wasn't informed that
you two were coming.

278
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:42,000
But then that must
have been the point.

279
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,900
Um, do you like what I did
on level one?

280
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,832
Very impressive.

281
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,700
Very.

282
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:49,832
Very, very.

283
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,534
In fact, uh, I think
we'd both love to see

284
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,233
what you've done
with level 15.

285
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,400
Mm-hmm.

286
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:56,700
Well, let me show you.

287
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,601
I'll give you the tour.

288
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,267
<i>I thought you'd be happy
for me.</i>

289
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,667
Babe, I am.

290
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,800
But if we do Doctors Without
Borders, we could save lives.

291
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:14,467
We can save lives here in L.A.
next to my brother.

292
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:15,932
I just talked
to Chuck this morning.

293
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,266
He thought it was
a great idea.

294
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,667
Oh, really? I find
that hard to believe

295
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:20,533
because I told him about USC
and he was happy for me.

296
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:22,534
Well, then I guess
we'll go talk to Chuck.

297
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,767
Oh, nice to see you, too.

298
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,701
Third opinion never hurts.

299
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,967
Ellie agreed to do this. I agreed
to do Doctors Without Borders,

300
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:41,000
which is a fantastic organization,
She said, and I quote, "I'm in."

301
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,366
but that was before
I found out about my

302
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,500
<i>Médecins Sans Frontières,
USC neurology</i>

303
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,133
is every good doctor's
fellowship at USC,

304
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,234
dream job. which is,
like, my dream job.

305
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,534
Devon, it appears to me
you're being completely selfish.

306
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,800
Morgan, sidebar now.

307
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,767
Just a sec, babe.

308
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,234
You can't tell Ellie
to stay here. Why?

309
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,634
If you had all the information
that I had,

310
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,333
you'd know that it's not safe
for her here.

311
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,866
If you had all
the intel I had,

312
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,768
you'd know that it is,
in fact, the safest place

313
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,099
for her to be.

314
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,701
What exactly do you
mean by that?

315
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:10,932
Nothing. Chuck's here.

316
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,000
He'd look after her.

317
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,701
Yes, but Chuck's job

318
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,833
can sometimes be

319
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,668
more demanding
than most would expect.

320
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,233
Indeed, sir, indeed.

321
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,767
Sure, Nerd Herding
does often call for

322
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:26,900
more than just
computer installs.

323
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,799
Do you know?
Do you know?

324
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,466
Do I know what? What
do you think I know?

325
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,166
I don't think you know half
what you think you know.

326
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,501
Fine. On three,
we both say what we know.

327
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,566
Okay.

328
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,266
One, two, three.

329
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,400
Chuck's a...
Chuck's a...

330
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:40,301
Oh, my God, you know.
Oh, my God, you know.

331
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,767
When did you know?
When did you find out?

332
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:42,600
A while, bro.

333
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,534
Man, it is so cool, huh?

334
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,668
Yeah, it's awesome, but
every time I go on a mission,

335
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,734
I put Ellie in danger,
and I can't have that.

336
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
Right.
I didn't think about that.

337
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,932
Wait, you went on missions?

338
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,700
You haven't?

339
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:55,700
What? Of course, dude...

340
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,601
You guys... I never
saw you out there.

341
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,134
Hmm-hmm.

342
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,867
Ellie, I've been thinking,
kids in L.A.,

343
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:06,366
eh, they don't need your help.

344
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,534
You know, with their
fancy designer jeans

345
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,634
and Lady Gaga sunglasses.

346
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,800
I say far, far away is where
a doctor could do the most good.

347
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,233
I think that you should go

348
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:16,566
and do Doctors Without
Borders, all right?

349
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,266
<i>Médecins Sans
Frontières.</i>

350
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,099
<i>Medecinse So Franswarez.</i>

351
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,034
<i>Médecins Sans Frontières.</i>

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,633
<i>Médecins Sans

353
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:26,967
<i>So, that was 14.
Here's level 15.</i>

354
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,867
I'm just so glad you're pleased
with my new security measures.

355
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,533
You know, I'm kind
of your biggest fan.

356
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:32,932
Really?

357
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,900
Yeah, yeah, I read and file
all of your mission reports.

358
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,900
Remember when you
reverse-engineered

359
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,066
an antidote to that bioweapon

360
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,566
and kissed Colonel Casey
only to realize later

361
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,199
it was all for naught?

362
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,334
That must've been exciting
and scary

363
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,667
at the same time, huh?

364
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:46,832
Can we just skip
the details for now?

365
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,667
We'll get
into that later.

366
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:51,200
Right now I'm-I'm really
interested in how you've

367
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:52,667
secured this holding cell.

368
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm the newest security measure.

369
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,501
I have the only key card
in the whole building.

370
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:00,301
This card is the only thing

371
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,967
that stands between the bad guys
and the holding cell.

372
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,199
Stanley...

373
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,266
Hmm?

374
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,167
We're gonna need that key card.

375
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,866
But...

376
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,767
Oh.

377
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,600
Oh, no.

378
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:16,933
I'll swallow the key card
if I have to.

379
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:20,133
Well, that's weird.

380
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:22,301
If we're still out here,
how is the alarm going off?

381
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:23,899
Somebody's coming.
We don't have time for this.

382
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,800
Time for what?

383
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:28,866
Was that absolutely necessary?

384
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,767
Yes.

385
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,967
There, look, Casey.

386
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:43,167
I really hope
that wasn't me.

387
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,967
Don't take another step.
We just want the Colonel.

388
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,401
Casey, you don't
understand.

389
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,799
Keller is not who
you think he is.

390
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,133
He's part of the Ring.

391
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:12,701
Let's go, John.

392
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,499
I can't believe that Casey's
a member of the Ring.

393
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,866
What are we supposed
to do now?

394
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,433
We just broke out of
a CIA facility.

395
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:39,632
We gotta get out
of here first.

396
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,533
Worry about finding
the Ring later.

397
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,234
When three of my agents
are arrested for treason

398
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:52,334
in 24 hours,
it reflects poorly on me.

399
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,000
Look, General, Casey...

400
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,499
You don't know
John Casey.

401
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,966
Not the way you think.

402
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,267
His real name is Alex Coburn.

403
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,800
We've unsealed his file
and this is what we've learned.

404
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:04,767
Alex Coburn faked his death
in Honduras

405
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:07,967
in 1989,
the same day that John Casey

406
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,733
was recruited for NSA Black Ops

407
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:11,467
by a Colonel James Keller.

408
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,000
Keller must've
recruited him again

409
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,166
and this time for the Ring.

410
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,566
And it's crucial
the Laudanol

411
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,233
doesn't fall
into their hands.

412
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,134
The only reason you're not
in federal prison right now

413
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:21,633
is because I have a mission
only you can accomplish.

414
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,234
Find and capture
Colonel John Casey.

415
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:26,201
Dead or alive.

416
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:35,033
Whoa!

417
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:36,934
Don't say a word.

418
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,133
Casey?

419
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,532
Mm-hmm.

420
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,600
I get it, I get it.

421
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,567
This is some kind of
mission, isn't it?

422
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,532
Yeah, that's right.

423
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,567
How would you like to be
a part of a very important,

424
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:50,933
very secret mission?

425
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,834
Yeah, yeah, can I get
a cool call name

426
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,233
like Condor or Lady Fingers?

427
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:56,134
Yeah.

428
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,967
Three years...

429
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:01,734
three years of missions,
training, I'm his friend.

430
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,433
How can all of that
have been a lie?

431
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,468
I don't know,
some people change.

432
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,067
You move forward as a spy,
and the line between what's

433
00:22:08,134 --> 00:22:10,267
right and wrong becomes
more and more gray.

434
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:12,734
You don't know what
to believe in or...

435
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,700
who to believe in.

436
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,401
I thought you had changed.

437
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:24,133
What do you mean?

438
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:28,767
I know that you want
to be the perfect spy,

439
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:31,934
and I know what
it means to you

440
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:34,734
and what you've sacrificed
to get there.

441
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:41,401
But please don't lose that guy
that I met three years ago.

442
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,267
Don't give up on the things
that make you great.

443
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,734
I'll always be that guy.

444
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:08,033
Sarah, I...

445
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:10,067
We should probably focus
on the Laudanol.

446
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:13,134
So, the only reason

447
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:15,234
that Keller would go to all
that trouble to break Casey out

448
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:16,666
would be if he still
didn't have it.

449
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,233
Which means if we get to it
before Casey does,

450
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:19,532
we've got a shot
at catching him.

451
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,500
Yeah, except there's
nothing left in the apartment.

452
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,666
What about the Buy More?

453
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,899
No, Casey's smarter than that.

454
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,166
He knows he would
never get past

455
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,033
those surveillance
cameras undetected.

456
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:28,532
He would have to use somebody.

457
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:33,034
And that someone would have
to be either desperate, stupid,

458
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:35,334
or just plain willing to do
anything to impress him.

459
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,400
<i>Planet of the Apes, huh?</i>

460
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,100
Planning on watching that alone?

461
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:01,101
<i>Yeah, well, you know me,
I can't get enough POTA.</i>

462
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,333
Liar.

463
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:03,566
You hated the original

464
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,800
because their upper
lips never moved.

465
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,733
I just...

466
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:09,767
I know,
it's just so unrealistic!

467
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:11,233
Morgan, did Casey ask you
to come here

468
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:12,400
and get something for him?

469
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,200
No, never.

470
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,101
Really? Really?
Is that so?

471
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:17,433
And could that something

472
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,233
be in the case that
you're holding right now?

473
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,467
That is absurd.

474
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:21,933
Now you're just
making stuff up.

475
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,733
Now you're just trying to...

476
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:25,632
Listen, this is my
first mission, Chuck,

477
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:26,766
and I don't want
to screw it up.

478
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,100
Now Casey, he told me

479
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,101
that I can't tell you anything,
and I won't.

480
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,499
I'm a rock.

481
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,167
If you give me that case
right now, I promise that later

482
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:36,334
I will answer all questions
that you have

483
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:38,700
about any of my missions.

484
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,566
In sordid detail?

485
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,467
Promise.

486
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:48,400
You're making
the right choice.

487
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,401
Okay, you're making
the right choice.

488
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:54,767
Sarah, I got it.

489
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:08,967
Where's Grimes?

490
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,766
You convinced the little rodent

491
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,100
to give you the case,
didn't you?

492
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:16,301
I knew he was weak.

493
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:19,834
Tell me where it is, now.

494
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,267
Don't make me do this,
Bartowski.

495
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,966
Don't shoot.

496
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,867
Give me the case
and I won't have to.

497
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,433
I believed in you.

498
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:44,401
I trusted you.

499
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,000
Chuck.

500
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,467
I know everything, Casey.

501
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:50,567
I know everything, okay?

502
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,767
I know that you used
to be Alex Coburn.

503
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:56,434
I know that you work
for James Keller,

504
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,734
and that you stole
the Laudanol for the Ring.

505
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:05,734
The only thing I don't know
is why.

506
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:24,267
Alex Coburn...

507
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,000
I had a fiancée.

508
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,934
Now she thinks I'm dead.

509
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:31,833
And if I don't turn over
the Laudanol to the Ring,

510
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,633
they're gonna kill her.

511
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:42,768
Her name's Kathleen McHugh.

512
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,334
20 years ago, she was the girl
I was gonna marry.

513
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:46,832
Love of my life.

514
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,501
But to be a spy
and protect our country,

515
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,600
I had to give up
that life.

516
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:51,866
And now she's going to die

517
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,033
because of a decision I made.

518
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:54,967
No, we're not gonna
let that happen.

519
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:56,233
If I don't deliver
the Laudanol

520
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:57,400
to his location
in the next hour,

521
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:58,866
they're gonna kill her.

522
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,667
What are we waiting for?

523
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:01,999
Let's go save her.
If I don't show

524
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,100
at the meet, Keller will
know something's wrong.

525
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,267
Well, then Chuck will
go to Kathleen's.

526
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,767
Yeah, yeah,
Sarah's right, I'll go.

527
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:09,668
Look, just give me the
address, I'll sneak her

528
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:10,866
out of there,
put her in a safe house.

529
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,199
I will protect her, Casey,
I promise.

530
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,700
You could be charged
with treason.

531
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,301
Hell, you didn't even know
I was Alex Coburn until today.

532
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,667
I don't care who you were.

533
00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:19,568
I know who you are.

534
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:23,367
And you're not in this alone.

535
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:26,667
Keller still expects you
at the meet.

536
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:28,568
What are we going to do?

537
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:34,534
Let's go to a meeting.

538
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,501
I'm alone, I'm unarmed.

539
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,000
All I've got is this here Cuban.

540
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,733
You mind?

541
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,634
Smoke it.

542
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:19,767
Hi, uh, Ms. McHugh?

543
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:21,433
Yes, may I help you?

544
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:22,899
Yes, I'm with the gas company.

545
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,034
I was just checking your
meter here out back,

546
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,367
and yeah,
I do detect a gas leak.

547
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:29,434
I'm sorry to tell you, so
I need you to leave with me.

548
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,401
Come on!
Oh...

549
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,768
Back inside the house.
Back inside the house quick!

550
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,133
But I thought you said...

551
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,999
Well, ignore everything
I said previously.

552
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,434
The gas leak is actually
outside the house. What?

553
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,401
Trust me, ma'am, it's my job
to smell these things.

554
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:43,767
See, I've been doing
it for years.

555
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:44,932
The whole cul-de-sac
could blow right now!

556
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,234
So, I need you back inside,
back inside the house.

557
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,201
Inside, inside!

558
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:54,100
Okay, this is, um,
this is getting kind of weird.

559
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,733
Who are you really?

560
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,434
I'm sorry, I promise
I'm not crazy.

561
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:03,100
This is for your own good.
Huh?

562
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:04,999
Hey!

563
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,734
Hey, let me outta here!

564
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:20,734
Hello, Alex.

565
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,234
You got the Laudanol?

566
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,267
I knew I could count on you.

567
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:37,134
Good soldiers always
follows orders.

568
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:40,999
You know, you wouldn't be
in this mess if you'd done

569
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,301
what I told you
20 years ago.

570
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,334
You were supposed
to let go of her.

571
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,634
Stop caring.

572
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:51,568
Tic Tac?

573
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:54,899
What the hell is this?

574
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,833
Your breath stinks.

575
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,067
You think you're just
going to walk out of here?

576
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,467
I got five men outside.

577
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,967
The one thing
I always taught you,

578
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:07,267
make sure you have
someone watch your back.

579
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:10,167
I know.

580
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,467
Five against one.

581
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:56,200
You didn't think this through!

582
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:57,866
You can't kill me

583
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:00,167
or Kathleen will die.

584
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,534
You'd never call them off.

585
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,501
You're right.

586
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,967
They're already at the house.

587
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,099
Gas company, Ms. McHugh.

588
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm the gas company.

589
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,566
Guys, how far are you?

590
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,400
<i>Five minutes.</i>

591
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:34,401
Look, anything immediate, you're
gonna have to handle yourself.

592
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:35,932
Yeah, well,
everything is immediate!

593
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,199
Well, then you have to flash.

594
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,466
I can't.
There's too many of them.

595
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,367
Take the pill, Chuck.

596
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,233
What pill?

597
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,234
You gave him the pill?
It's in your right pocket.

598
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:48,200
The Laudanol was developed to
calm emotions, eliminate fear.

599
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:50,033
Chuck, it can make you

600
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,934
the Intersect you were
always supposed to be.

601
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:56,832
Gas company, Ms. McHugh.

602
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,733
Open up!

603
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,967
Chuck!

604
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,100
I just checked the meter,
everything's fine.

605
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:25,150
Come on,
let me out! Help!

606
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,899
Thank you so much... Hey!

607
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,034
Wait a second.
What the...?

608
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,800
You're not from the gas company.

609
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,433
I'm not afraid...

610
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:48,334
of any of you.

611
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:02,100
Chuck! Chuck, stop!

612
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,067
Oh, my God.

613
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,000
Do I know you?

614
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:01,034
Kath, I'm sorry.
I- I can't come home sooner.

615
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,667
I've got one more mission.

616
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:05,067
I think I'm going really
be able to help people.

617
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:06,733
You don't have to explain.

618
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:09,134
You love what you do
and you're good at it.

619
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,134
I just want you to know,
if something happens to me,

620
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,967
no matter what, I love you.

621
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,799
Listen, you're never one
to get emotional with me,

622
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,266
so don't let
your guard down now.

623
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:24,634
That way you can get back to me
in one piece.

624
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:27,167
Got it?

625
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:30,200
Yes, ma'am.

626
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:32,833
And when you do come back,

627
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,000
I've got some news...

628
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,067
Tonight at 2200,

629
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:41,401
Lieutenant Alex Coburn
will be killed in battle.

630
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:44,734
He'll die a hero
and be given a hero's funeral.

631
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,334
From this point on,
your name is John Casey.

632
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,334
Make it a good life,
soldier.

633
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:59,534
The authorities just
arrived, Ms. McHugh.

634
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:04,200
Mom.

635
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:06,033
Alex.

636
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:09,334
What's with the police
cars outside?

637
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,334
It's okay. Shh, it's okay.

638
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:14,534
I'll be all right.

639
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,233
Casey...

640
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:17,899
Wait.

641
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,566
You-you can't just...

642
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:20,999
What's dead is dead.

643
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,900
It's too late now.

644
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,667
Despite the success of
the mission, Colonel Casey,

645
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:37,333
you abused your
privileged position

646
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:38,966
and if you were
anyone else,

647
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,867
you would be right back in jail.

648
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,134
But you are not just anyone.

649
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:49,067
And I'm about to give you
your second second chance.

650
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:51,501
Which is two more
than most people get.

651
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:52,799
Thank you, General.

652
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,568
Second chance as a civilian.

653
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,666
Um...

654
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,866
but, uh-uh, General,

655
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,599
Casey has given his entire life
to this country.

656
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,568
I mean, surely you can't
just make him start over.

657
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,534
He's done it once before.

658
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,900
He shouldn't have a problem
doing it again.

659
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,934
For the final time,

660
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,900
you are dismissed.

661
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:29,267
Good luck, John.

662
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,267
Mr. Bartowski...

663
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,568
Please escort Mr. Casey

664
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:47,568
off government property.

665
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:11,067
I want to commend
you, Agent Walker,

666
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:12,833
for your work
with the Intersect.

667
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,732
He seems to need you
less and less.

668
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:18,667
Yes, uh,
Chuck has certainly changed,

669
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:21,834
and he is well on his way
to becoming the perfect spy.

670
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,700
A while back you requested
a transfer out of Burbank,

671
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,133
and I haven't forgotten.

672
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:28,834
There's an empty seat on
my flight back to D.C.,

673
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,467
if you'd still
like to go.

674
00:38:30,468 --> 00:38:32,033
We could discuss it
on the way.

675
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:34,434
I leave in an hour-

676
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:36,401
if you'd like to join
me, Agent Walker.

677
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,334
Thank you.

678
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,767
* *

679
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,999
Hey, stranger.

680
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm sorry, you are?

681
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:54,200
Your brother,

682
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,899
who you never see.

683
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,433
How are you?

684
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,534
You okay?
You look exhausted.

685
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,034
I am. It's this, uh, it's this
Doctors Without Borders thing.

686
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:05,767
I think Devon really
wants to do it.

687
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,734
And I did, too.

688
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:10,633
So I think I'm going
to do it, Chuck.

689
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,067
Yeah?

690
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,034
Yeah.

691
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:18,667
USC neurology- that's
kind of been your dream

692
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,633
ever since you
were a kid, El.

693
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:21,933
I know, I know.

694
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:24,468
But dreams change.

695
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:26,700
And if there is one thing
that I know for sure,

696
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,400
it's that I want
to be with Devon.

697
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,100
And it might require
some sacrifice

698
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,632
from both of us,

699
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:35,367
but he's the best choice
I ever made.

700
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:39,501
There you are, El.

701
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:41,700
Hey, uh...

702
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:44,600
can I steal you away?
Yeah.

703
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,600
Love you. Both.

704
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,666
Babe...

705
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,867
I realize that I
didn't congratulate you

706
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:07,732
for getting
the fellowship.

707
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:10,401
And that was only
my first mistake.

708
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:12,300
But I should have
talked to you first.

709
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:16,301
If this is important to you,
then it is important to me.

710
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:19,900
I'm sorry I lost
sight of that.

711
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,201
Babe, take the job.

712
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:24,700
We'll make it work.

713
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:26,667
Together.

714
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,568
See?

715
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:41,733
This space can work.

716
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,367
It'll be great
for civilian life.

717
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:47,033
I mean, take
a look around.

718
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:51,101
You got a... you
got a nice chair.

719
00:40:57,733 --> 00:41:00,767
You know, you can
still go back.

720
00:41:03,134 --> 00:41:06,934
The general made the terms
of my dismissal crystal clear.

721
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:15,101
I was talking
about Kathleen.

722
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:22,000
She lives right
around here, man.

723
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:25,534
And, uh,
you got a daughter, Casey.

724
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:31,600
You know I made my decision
between love and love of country

725
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,000
a long time ago.

726
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:35,967
And it was the right
decision for me.

727
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:40,766
Now you have to make a decision

728
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:42,667
whether that's
the right one for you.

729
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,967
Walker's a good woman.

730
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:52,633
It's still not too late.

731
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:04,934
D.C.'s beautiful
this time of year.

732
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,599
You from this area?

733
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,366
No.

734
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:11,301
But I'm thinking
of moving here.

735
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,381
