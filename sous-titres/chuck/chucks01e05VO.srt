1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,330
Chinese.
- Chinese?

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,500
Oh, yeah, man.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,600
That's what "an evening
with morgan" is all about.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,930
You didn't forget
to tell her, did you?

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,100
About "an evening with morgan?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,110
No. No, no, no, no.
Of course not. No.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,390
She's been looking
forward to it all week.

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,370
When are we going to hang out with your funny little friend?
- " yeah?She says that?

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,650
Good, good, good.

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,760
Make sure her head's
in the game, okay?

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,130
This is kind of her big shot to prove to me
she has something to bring to this relationship.

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,730
Feel me?

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,370
Hey, nothing but feeling you.

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,180
Good, good, good.

15
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,130
"an evening with morgan"
will begin at 7:00 sharp.

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,700
Bring your "a" game.

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Love ya, pal.

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,090
"an evening of morgan"?

19
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,640
Okay, so here's the thing.

20
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,320
He's my best friend, and i haven't
really gotten to spend any time with him

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,520
or ellie this week, and so he really wanted
the whole bunch of us to hang out tonight.

22
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,530
For "an evening of morgan"?

23
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,480
I thought being stationed in the
khyber pass for six months was brutal.

24
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,970
If you're so sad about not being
included, casey, you can just say so.

25
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,850
Dinner with you and morgan?

26
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,740
I'd rather afghani warlords
bleed me from my liver.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,230
He's a happy person.

28
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,860
I appreciate that about him
- and he works hard, so...

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,570
"an evening with morgan"
will consist of three acts.

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,980
Act one, dinner.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,610
What are we having?

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,210
A little delicacy
called sizzling shrimp.

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,620
That's right. That's right.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,880
We're going to pack our bellies so full of
shrimp you're going to make a seal jealous.

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,520
Wow! Sounds like quite a night.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,510
Oh, and that's just the beginning.

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,670
Dinner will be followed by a screening over at
chuck's of the greatest kung fu film ever made.

38
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,150
Enter the dragon.
- Enter the dragon.

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,910
Prepare to die, my bearded friend.

40
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,350
Bring it. Bring it on.

41
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,340
Come on. Come on.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,420
What are you doing?

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,630
Okay, and the third act can
only be found here in chinatown.

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,750
There he is. Be cool.

45
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,200
Hey, wait a minute.

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,960
I thought you were
off this stuff, buddy.

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,990
Yeah? Well, i'm
sorry, chuck. Right?

48
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,460
Daddy needs his
fix, you know? Dude.

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,050
You know how i feel
about fireworks!

50
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,430
You know what? To defeat fear,

51
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,820
one must embrace fear.

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,610
I'd rather embrace my limbs.

53
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,090
Specifically, all of them.

54
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,030
No fireworks. No sale.

55
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,860
Well, can i say something?

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,850
This evening gets
as asterisk, okay?

57
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,950
We've still got our
shrimp on, though.

58
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,850
No, no, no, no. You got to be
kidding me. They can't be closed.

59
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,380
"an evening with morgan" has to
at least include sizzling shrimp.

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,150
Morgan, it's okay.
We'll do it another time.

61
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,290
No, no. I got this. I got this.

62
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,390
Lucky for us, i got connections.

63
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,750
Well, got to give
him points for effort.

64
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,930
My friend juan, he's a dishwasher.

65
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,750
Leaves his keys for me
in case of emergencies.

66
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,190
Hey, we got to make this
quick. Ellie's waiting for us.

67
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,220
You hear that sizzle?

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,240
Like the sound of angels' laughter.

69
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
Wait here.

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,840
That waitress.

71
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,110
She's mei-ling cho,
chinese intelligence.

72
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,230
Never stepped foot
on u. S. Soil before.

73
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,170
Sizzling shrimp, anyone?

74
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,870
My god!

75
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,930
Well, you can just call me morgan,
babe, but i appreciate the enthusiasm.

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,470
This the woman you saw tonight?

77
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,250
Yeah.

78
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,650
Read through these.

79
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,860
Twice. Let us know if
you flash on anything.

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,490
Call the director. Tell him
we got a priority code orange.

81
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,700
Guys, is there any way that
this can wait until morning?

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,690
'Cause i kind of have a
priority code ellie and morgan.

83
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,430
They're waiting for us for dinner.

84
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,360
China's top spy is in los angeles.

85
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,750
We don't know why she's here,
what she's planning to do.

86
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,190
You, my friend, may be the only
one who can figure that out.

87
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,320
That's your priority. Copy?

88
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
Copy.

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,580
Hey, sis.

93
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
Good morning.

94
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,430
Or not.

95
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,050
Could you pass the berry loops?

96
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,150
Are you sure you don't
want any sizzling shrimp?

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,390
Right.

98
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,670
You know, 'cause we have a
whole lot of that left over.

99
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,320
'Cause i got back late last night.

100
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,070
This is the point
i'm trying to make.

101
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,980
And you're making it very
well, i want you to know that.

102
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,330
You know, it's one thing to let
several pounds of shrimp go to waste,

103
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,240
it's another to stand me up,
but to leave me with morgan?

104
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,440
And i-i-i feel terrible
about that, believe me, i do.

105
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,380
You know how much i
adore sizzling shrimp.

106
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,870
And you.

107
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,040
More specifically you.

108
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,970
It's just... Sarah wasn't
feeling well, and...

109
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,070
Oh, well, what is it? I'm a doctor.

110
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,660
I believe, uh, she
had a spastic colon.

111
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,990
Yuck. I know.

112
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,060
A girl that beautiful with
a colon that spastic...

113
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,760
Well, you know what tomorrow is.

114
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,830
Absolutely, yes.

115
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,490
It's our, our very own october
version of mother's day,

116
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,400
and i wouldn't miss it
for the world, i swear.

117
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,120
I should hope not.

118
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,590
But then again, i never figured that you
would pass on sizzling shrimp, either.

119
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,140
So i went over the department of defense
files on mei-ling again this morning.

120
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,270
Sorry, no flashes.

121
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,260
Well, she's here for a reason.

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,650
Maybe you'll flash
on something tonight.

123
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,830
Tonight?

124
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,610
Yeah, we're running a
surveillance op on her.

125
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,030
We're gonna tail her, see if you
flash on anyone she's talking to.

126
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,590
Might tell us why she's here.

127
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,460
My first stakeout. Okay.

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,570
Okay, yeah. What do i need to
bring? Sweater?Light jacket?

129
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,690
No, you just bring that
computer in your head.

130
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,840
Okay, you know what?

131
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,300
I have a lot more to offer this
team, other than the intersect.

132
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,650
For instance, what are we
doing for tunes tonight?

133
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,570
I can make a stakeout mix.

134
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,660
Big mike: john.

135
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,840
Need all the green shirts
in my office, on the double.

136
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Have fun.

137
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
That's really not... Fair.

138
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,350
Sales are down, people.

139
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,490
There's too much horsing around.

140
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,610
And what this team needs is some
good old-fashioned motivation.

141
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,710
Morgan: i couldn't agree
with you more, big man.

142
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,440
24 hour sales
competition. Starting now.

143
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,230
First prize
- iphone.

144
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,790
Second prize
- large pizza, two toppings.

145
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,590
Third prize...

146
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,070
Don't even say small
pizza, all right?

147
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,490
'Cause that's not a
prize. That's a punishment.

148
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,280
I eat a small pizza and not only
am i still hungry, i'm angry,

149
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,720
and you wouldn't want me
hungry and angry, all right,

150
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,700
'cause then i get kind of cranky, then i
get a little mean, then i kind of get sleepy.

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,830
Third prize is you
get to keep your job.

152
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,110
Last prize... You're fired.

153
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,370
Doesn't sound like much of
a prize either, am i right?

154
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,890
Let me show you the
deluxe model, okay?

155
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,600
Now, supposedly, this baby
makes delicious milkshakes.

156
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,730
You probably want to hold off
on the calories some, hoss.

157
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,790
Let me show you the
exercise equipment.

158
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,890
They're actually
right over here, so...

159
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,990
If it's for the game,
buy the big screen, man.

160
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,830
Game's over, return it.

161
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,690
Break it, kick a freakin'
hole in the thing.

162
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,110
Money back guarantee, dude.

163
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,430
We'll even pick it up for you.

164
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,340
This is crazy.

165
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,950
I know i'm the salesman, but, uh,
how much you want for your shirt?

166
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,370
'Cause i've been looking for something
to go with my beard, you know,

167
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,680
and this thing is just...
Actually, you know what?

168
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,490
Let me see the label. Can i just...

169
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,120
Grimes!

170
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,120
You are the worst
salesmen i've ever seen.

171
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,870
Vultures are circling.
Get it in gear!

172
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,220
We're in trouble, chuck.

173
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,940
Harry tang's plan to eliminate
us has gone into full effect.

174
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
The sales competition?
- Yeah, man. -

175
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,230
You think you can carve out about an hour
after work, help me with my sales technique?

176
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,410
Tonight?
- Yeah.

177
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,280
I'm sorry, buddy. No can do.

178
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
I already made plans
with sarah tonight.

179
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,580
Okay, all right.

180
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,100
Tomorrow, me and you, a
little morgan time, huh?

181
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,840
Tomorrow i've got
mother's day with ellie.

182
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,780
I could only miss that if there
was a major national emergency.

183
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,550
So to speak.

184
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,460
Listen to me, chuck.

185
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,740
Dude, it's me, all right?

186
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,400
Now, i'm begging you here.

187
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm-i'm on my knees.

188
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,280
You know, hat in hand,
that sort of thing.

189
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,920
Help me, chuck bartowski,
you're my only hope.

190
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,020
Okay, okay.

191
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm going to go out
with sarah tonight,

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,900
i'm going to try and wrap that
up early enough to get back here,

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,590
help you and then i'll hang
out with ellie tomorrow...

194
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,390
Yeah, yeah, i think
i can make that work.

195
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,490
I knew i could count on you, bro.

196
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
I hope so.

197
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,890
Hey, we have a bogey at 6:00 here.

198
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,470
Uh, excuse me. Someone send in
an order for sizzling shrimp?

199
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,750
A mr. Carmichael?

200
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,370
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.
That's me. I'll take that.

201
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,860
Thank you very much.

202
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,340
You go ahead and keep the change.

203
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Thank you..
- Have a good night.

204
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,140
What?It's for morgan.
I called it in.

205
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,510
The idea behind a stakeout is to
remain inconspicuous, you moron.

206
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,830
Uh, hello?

207
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,930
That's why i used an alias.

208
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,450
Hey, i think we have some company.

209
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,890
Chuck: who's that?

210
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,820
Casey: old ironside is ben lo pan.

211
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,050
He's the local big
shot businessman.

212
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,280
Owns, like, half of chinatown.

213
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
And there's mei-ling.

214
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
We're on.

215
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,570
Chuck: hey, hey, hey, she's gonna get ahead of us.
- No, we're good.

216
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,740
Always leave a 30-yard cushion
from your target on the tail.

217
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,420
She's following ben lo pan's limo.

218
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,310
Oh, a tail on a tail.

219
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,660
Does that mean, like,
a 60-yard cushion or

220
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,030
would you say the regular tail
rules apply in this situa...

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,570
Glocks on a crotch
rocket. My kind of gal.

222
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,780
Those aren't glocks.

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
They're chinese
army-issue pistols.

224
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,290
She's not here on a spy mission.

225
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,300
She's here to assassinate
the guy in the wheelchair.

226
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,910
You sure?

227
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,340
Yeah, i'm pretty sure. You know,
locked away in the brain here.

228
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,100
I mean, i'm not bragging. The
intersect's doing all the heavy lifting.

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,100
Okay, we can't wait for the cops.

230
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,440
By the time they get here, mei-ling
or ben lo pan may be dead or both.

231
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,530
Mei-ling could be a small
part of a larger operati0n.

232
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,420
We need her alive. We want
to find out what she knows.

233
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,950
We catch her, the chinese spy
has a lot we'd love to hear.

234
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,240
All right, chuck, pull
the car around front.

235
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,680
What?Around the front?
Then what do i do?

236
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,030
Stay in the car.

237
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,810
My four favorite words.

238
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,420
Hi-o.

239
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,060
Chuck's not here, morgan.

240
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
My four favorite words.

241
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,640
Get out.

242
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,080
Not favorites, but at
least we're dialoguing.

243
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,480
He's on a date with sarah.
I'll tell him you stopped by.

244
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,520
I would appreciate that.

245
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,970
He's supposed to be
helping me right now.

246
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,260
If i don't become a better salesman
by tomorrow night, i could get fired.

247
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,480
Although, i guess i could just
crash here until i land on my feet.

248
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,940
As inspired as that makes me to help
you, i would rather just change the locks.

249
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,190
I'll let myself out.

250
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,290
Now my four favorite words.

251
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya.

252
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,700
Oh, don't eat me! Boy, you're dead.

253
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,180
Come on.

254
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,480
* private eyes, they're
watching you, they see...

255
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,930
stakeouts are kinda fun.

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
The bar's crowded. Is he here?

257
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,450
No.

258
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,550
Hey, you on the list?

259
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,660
Hands in the air now!
- Easy. Federal agents.

260
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,090
Against the wall.

261
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,260
Come on. You're
making a big mistake.

262
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Your boss is in danger.

263
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,530
They think we're with her.

264
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,240
What?

265
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,770
They think we're with her.

266
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,870
No kill shot.

267
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
I hate playing nice.

268
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,990
Gunshots. Gunshots.

269
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,100
Listen to sarah and
casey; stay in the car.

270
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Hey, the wheelchair guy.

271
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,950
Hey, let me help
you get out of here.

272
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,140
Yeah, help me! Help me!

273
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,820
A lady's trying to kill me.

274
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
My car, this way.

275
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,170
I think i'm fine now.

276
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,270
Here, here you go.

277
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,960
Chuck: why is he tied up?
Throw him in the trunk!

278
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Chuck: what? The trunk?

279
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,540
That's not very... Nice.

280
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
Why would you...

281
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,830
Where are they taking him?

282
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,640
I don't know! I don't know!

283
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,510
You work for him?

284
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,260
What?No, no, no, wait
- hold on a second.

285
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,530
I was just trying to help an old guy in
a wheelchair, who puts people in trunks.

286
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,020
You idiot.

287
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,810
That old man is triad.

288
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,750
Chinese mafia.

289
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,060
That was my brother
he threw in the trunk!

290
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,840
Your brother?

291
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,050
You were trying to...
- Rescue him.

292
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,140
Until you got in the way.

293
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,860
Sarah: federal
agent! Drop your gun!

294
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
No, no, no! No, no,
no, s-sar-sarah...

295
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,680
Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah.

296
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,230
Are you hurt?
- No.

297
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,820
What the hell just happened?

298
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,210
She was just trying
to rescue her brother.

299
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I guess i was wrong.

300
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,170
What, are we carpooling now?

301
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,600
Just heard back from washington.

302
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,490
They confirmed mei-ling's story.

303
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,480
Her brother lee cho's a
low-level bureaucrat from beijing.

304
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,210
He was kidnapped on a
business trip to I.a.

305
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,170
By local triads.

306
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,080
The chinese received a ransom call asking
for the release of a triad captain in beijing.

307
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,110
They refused.

308
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,880
Sarah: mei-ling
was here on her own.

309
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,150
Her government never
signed off on a rescue op.

310
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,910
Chuck: what's the connection
to the guy in the wheelchair?

311
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,210
Sarah: well, the feds have always
suspected that he had triad roots,

312
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,460
but they could never prove it.

313
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,580
Okay, so what do we do now?

314
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Nothing. We stay out of it.

315
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,610
Hold on a second.

316
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,500
I watched that guy get
stuffed into a trunk.

317
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,630
And it's because i got it wrong.

318
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,580
We're not going to start an
international incident over

319
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,430
someone not even the
chi-coms care about.

320
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,430
Let it go, chuck, huh?

321
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,370
Sarah, i screwed up,
okay? It's my fault.

322
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,980
Her brother's going to
die, and it's all my fault.

323
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,550
No, it's her fault.

324
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,220
She went off the grid and she
disobeyed orders coming here.

325
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,780
Yeah, but her superiors didn't
even give her a choice. Come on!

326
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,920
Sarah, i'd have done the same thing, if
it was ellie. I'd have done the same thing.

327
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,960
Minus the shooting
apart the club part.

328
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,530
I know how you feel.

329
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,630
It was hard for me, too,
when i first started.

330
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,880
But the truth is we can't
save everyone, chuck.

331
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,970
Big mike must not have been clear
about how a sales competition works.

332
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,730
The idea here, morgan,
um, is to sell things.

333
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,560
I can't get fired.

334
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,050
How will i eat?

335
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,560
I'll starve on the soup line.

336
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,370
I hate soup, all right?

337
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,580
Soup is not a meal.

338
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,500
It's hardly an
appetizer, for god's sake.

339
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,670
Can i have your locker, dude?

340
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,900
I call his buy more windbreaker.

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,570
Fine, but i get his name tag.
- Fine.

342
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,460
Can i say something?

343
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,260
You guys need me, okay?

344
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,860
'Cause with me gone, someone else is going
to have to be the butt of all the jokes.

345
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,940
Let me tell you something, jeff,
you don't want to carry that mantle.

346
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,460
Maybe you do want to carry that mantle.
- We'll take that mantle.

347
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,510
Right?
- Yes.

348
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,950
Listen, you're not gonna let me take
the bullet on this one, right, guys?

349
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,510
Yes. Absolutely. Nice knowing you.

350
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,370
Nerd herd. Bartowski speaking.

351
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,750
Mei-ling: i'm looking
at you right now.

352
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,850
Oh, you're looking at me right now.

353
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,160
Who is this?

354
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,430
Let's just say you owe me.

355
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,880
For ruining my rescue operation.

356
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,480
Mei-ling.

357
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,940
Mei-ling: put your hand down.

358
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,870
If you signal your friend, it's
the last thing you'll ever do.

359
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,050
By the way, nice mustard stain.

360
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,110
Where are you?

361
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,410
Not near the kelly
clarkson display.

362
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,710
What exactly do you want?

363
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,430
The triads put a clock
on my brother's life.

364
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,940
He dies in nine hours,
if i don't do something.

365
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,170
Okay, yeah, about that. About that.

366
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,390
Listen, i'm really, really sorry.

367
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,110
And if there's anything that
i can do to make up for it...

368
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,430
Help me rescue him.

369
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,340
I'm a dead man.

370
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,370
Dude, i'm in last place
in the sales competition.

371
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,940
If you do not help me,
i am gonna get fired.

372
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,850
One word to him and
you're a dead man too.

373
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,930
Not now, morgan, please.

374
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,110
I have a really,
really upset customer.

375
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,190
Dit!

376
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,890
Listen to me. Listen to me.

377
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm a good samaritan.

378
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,560
I just helped the wrong guy.

379
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,220
I help people run computers,
not rescue operations.

380
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,590
I tailed you and your handlers.

381
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,070
You have a team watching your every step,
which means you can help, and you will.

382
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,160
I'll be in touch soon.

383
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,780
Hello? Hello...

384
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,860
Want a hot dog?

385
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,960
It's an emergency.

386
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,590
So, listen, i've been thinking
a lot about last night.

387
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,300
And, you know, you guys were talking
about how the spy could be valuable to us.

388
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,770
So, i was thinking, what
if we could convince her to,

389
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,660
i don't know, like, uh,
give up some secret stuff...

390
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,400
You mean defect?

391
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,220
Defect!Yes!

392
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,870
People do that kind of
thing all the time, right?

393
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,590
<i>the hunt for red
october. white nights.</i>

394
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,420
<i>white nights
- gregory hines, baryshnikov, dancing their way to freedom.</i>

395
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,960
Well, as long as you've done
serious research on the subject.

396
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,930
You get her to defect, i'll help
rescue her brother personally.

397
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,620
Why are you bringing this up?

398
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,980
Well, she sort of...

399
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,160
Just... Called me.

400
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,990
She called you?Where?

401
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,100
At the buy more.

402
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,420
I think she might've been in the store,
too, because she knew my every move.

403
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,960
She even knew that i
had mustard on my tie.

404
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
What?Hey, where are
we... Wait a minute!

405
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,910
Hey!Hey, morgan... Hey, buddy.

406
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,340
Listen, i'm really
sorry about last night.

407
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
I got home really late.

408
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,370
Yeah, don't sweat it, man. It's
just my livelihood at stake.

409
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,210
What about tonight?
Maybe after mother's day.

410
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,350
Working a double shift, you know.

411
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,850
It's my last chance to kind of make
enough sales to, uh, not get fired.

412
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,950
Thanks, though, pal.

413
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,880
Chuck...

414
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,020
There's a delivery of hard drives in
the storage cage you need to sign for.

415
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,140
Great. Thank you... Jeff.

416
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,370
Where's chuck?

417
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,960
Storage cage signing
for a delivery.

418
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,390
I thought deliveries come at 6:00.

419
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,490
I guess they got here early, dude.

420
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,910
Oh, hey, i think that's for me.

421
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,450
Please tell me that's not real.

422
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
The gun, not the clipboard.

423
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,820
Real enough?

424
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,980
Listen, listen, they agreed to
help if you would just defect.

425
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,690
What?

426
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,120
It's really not that
bad here, you know.

427
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,280
The chinese food's pretty good.
Have you tried sizzling shrimp?

428
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,030
Drop the gun! Drop it!

429
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,950
Let go...

430
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,280
Shoot me, i shoot him.

431
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,640
Chuck: hey, hey, i got an idea.

432
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,800
How about a new plan that
involves less shooting.

433
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,800
Casey... Casey...

434
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,300
You agreed to help if
she defected, right?

435
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,120
I would never...

436
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,120
Why? Too much loyalty
to your government?

437
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,840
The same one that left
your brother for dead?

438
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,270
If i defect, i can
never go back to china.

439
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,370
I will never see my brother again.

440
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,900
And if you don't, you'll lose him
forever. And you don't want that.

441
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,200
Guys... Promise mei-ling you'll help
rescue her brother if she defects. Please.

442
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,260
Please?

443
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,700
Promise. Now let the kid go.

444
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,990
How do i know i can trust you?

445
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,090
You don't have any other choice.

446
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,880
Casey: this is the floor
plan of ben lo pan's estate.

447
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,330
My intel says they're
holding my brother here...

448
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,600
Near the center of the mansion.

449
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,080
Getting in is one thing, getting
out is going to be the real trick.

450
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,120
Lo pan's got a private
army of security guards.

451
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,350
When the alarms go, they'll
be on us like white on...

452
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,450
Thank you, casey.

453
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,060
Hey, what up, sis?
- Oh, good.

454
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,680
Did you remember to
defrost the chicken?

455
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,570
You know that i did.
And you know why?

456
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,540
Because it's mother's
day and i'm here for you.

457
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,270
Prodigal brother returns.

458
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,550
You need some help?
- Yes. Thanks.

459
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,220
So this will be fun
- just you and i.

460
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,450
It's been a while.
It's been too long.

461
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,960
But tonight is all about
brother-sister bonding.

462
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,910
You know, catching up. Catching up,
by the way, with no distractions.

463
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,550
And as soon as i answer this
call, i will turn it off, i swear.

464
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,790
Hello.
- It's casey.

465
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,910
Get over here. I want to
see if you flash on anything.

466
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,310
What was that?

467
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,760
Nothing, nothing.

468
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,120
It's casey
- john casey my coworker. He needs some help with decorating tips.

469
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,770
Like color swatches?
I could help with that.

470
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,170
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't want to... x

471
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,310
No, that's very thoughtful of
you, i really appreciate that.

472
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,610
But he's a guy's guy. You
know, he wants a man's opinion.

473
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,380
He's a hunter, so he's
really into hunting

474
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,350
and he doesn't quite know
which deer to mount, on...

475
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,490
Well, you have a couple of
hours before dinner, so...

476
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,010
I need to focus on
the kitchen anyway.

477
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,010
You sure?
- Yeah.

478
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,210
Oh, you know what, why don't you
take him some of my special guacamole.

479
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,090
You know, like as
a housewarming gift.

480
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,250
That...

481
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,750
Wow, thank you, sis.

482
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,070
That's really thoughtful of you.

483
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,110
Just make sure to keep
it away from sarah.

484
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,460
This is definitely not
good for her spastic colon.

485
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,060
Yes, you're... Got it,
right. Yeah, the spastic...

486
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay, i promise i will be
back by 8:00. I promise.

487
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,970
Hi. Hey, i brought
ellie's secret recipe.

488
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,110
Just trying to help out the
mission any way that i can.

489
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:02,940
Can't really stay.

490
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,730
There are at least ten guards we know of
stationed at these points here, here, here.

491
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,160
Sarah: the security
cameras are tkx-50's.

492
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,150
They're a little outdated, but
they're equipped for remote access.

493
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,250
Either of you familiar with them?

494
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,910
Chuck: i am.

495
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,020
Yeah, we used to
sell them at buy more.

496
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,520
Did a bunch of installs
a few years back.

497
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,780
They're pretty easy to access.

498
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,670
Good.

499
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,950
Every warm body helps.

500
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,010
I'm sorry... Me?

501
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,730
No, no, no, no, no.

502
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,920
Look, as much as i wish that
i could help you, i can't.

503
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,890
I made plans with my sister
that are nonnegotiable.

504
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,140
But, of course, i know that you wouldn't
be in this mess if it weren't for me.

505
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,420
I want to be with my sister and you
obviously really want to be with your brother.

506
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,870
We're like one big whacky
transatlantic family.

507
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,960
I owe you. I'm in.

508
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,270
Okay, fine.

509
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,470
But you don't leave the
van under any circumstances.

510
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,540
I just need to be home by
8:00, if that's at all possible.

511
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,790
Casey: chuck?Chuck?
Chuck, am i coming through?

512
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,890
Yep, i gotcha.

513
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,200
* oh, hey, we have liftoff!

514
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,910
Oh!Half a big gulp. New record.

515
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,130
I am spartacus.

516
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,770
Hey, guys.

517
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,500
Kind of need your help.

518
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,370
Oh, last in the sales competition,
chuck not here to bail you out this time?

519
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,760
Why else would i be here?

520
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,010
You know, by helping
you out, aren't we...

521
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,420
Aren't we messing with
the laws of nature?

522
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,610
I mean, the weak die, and the...

523
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,250
The strong prevail.

524
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,390
Who are we to play god?

525
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,140
I'll give you half my pizza
if i get into second place.

526
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,960
The wounded raccoon.
- The wounded raccoon.

527
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,080
Don't know what that
is, but whatever works.

528
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,180
Whatever w...

529
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Watch this.

530
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
That's a great product, huh?

531
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,850
It's two gigs of memory.
Extended warranty.

532
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,640
Yeah, it's a little pricey,
but you know what? I'll take it.

533
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
It's a gift for my sick nephew.

534
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,570
Sick nephew, huh?

535
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,260
Tell you what.

536
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,950
Don't tell anybody, but
it's on sale at large mart.

537
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,510
Save yourself 50 bucks.

538
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,210
You'd give up a sale just to
save me $50? That's so sweet.

539
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,265
Ah, just, uh...
- You know what?Here.

540
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:01,410
Call me sometime for coffee.

541
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,250
Wow, i will. Coffee
s-sounds great. x

542
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,830
Lester: look at the little man.

543
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,080
So weak. So pathetic.

544
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,750
And you wonder why you're last
in sales and about to get fired?

545
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,140
Maybe if you spent your time selling
merchandise instead of trolling for phone numbers

546
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,530
you wouldn't be flat broke, and living
with your mother and be forced to...

547
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,540
To pick leftovers out of the
garbage so that you can eat.

548
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,670
Can i have my number back, please?

549
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,270
Well, let me just...

550
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,500
Are you kidding me? What was that?

551
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,840
The wounded raccoon.

552
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,570
Yeah, you-you berate and humiliate
the salesman in front of the customer,

553
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,090
like so, which i-i
thought we did very well.

554
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,180
And the customer feels so bad,
that they'll, they'll buy anything.

555
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,750
It's the-the pity sale.

556
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,020
Always wondered if it worked.

557
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,870
Guess not.
- No, it does not. It does not.

558
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,160
Sarah: all right, listen, the
guards are looking at a static loop.

559
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,960
You're our eyes, chuck.

560
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,210
If you see any trouble
coming, you let us know.

561
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,040
Got it. Let's just make
this quick. 7:15's my curfew.

562
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,730
Okay, we're going inside.

563
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,940
Casey: chuck, what do you see?

564
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,190
Uh... Let's see... x

565
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,170
Okay, i've got, i've got one guard
by himself at the security monitors.

566
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,270
Thank you.

567
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,960
Good, good, good work, but
let's not get cocky, huh, team?

568
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,830
Shut up, chuck. What's next?

569
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,950
Right, right... Looking...
Looking... Looking...

570
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,000
Okay, okay.

571
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,820
I've got, i've got three
guards in the kitchen area.

572
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,470
Sarah: we see them.

573
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,140
Be careful. They're, they're
bigger than the first guy.

574
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,820
All right, kicking butt.

575
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,260
Casey: what happened
to "don't get cocky"?

576
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
My bad. Professional faux pas.

577
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,270
Wait, hey, hey, hey, what happened?

578
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,420
I
- i lost all visual on the security cameras.

579
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,850
Guys? Guys?

580
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,420
All i can see is what casey's
lipstick camera is picking up.

581
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,300
Put down the book,
ironside. Hands up.

582
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,430
Guys, if you're seeing
this, you might want to run.

583
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,200
You think?

584
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,090
Perfect timing, mei-ling.

585
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,060
Your government has just refused
my final offer for your brother.

586
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,310
Hopefully they will
change their minds,

587
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,470
now that i have two american
agents to barter with.

588
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,410
Sarah?

589
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,650
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

590
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,150
Chuck, it's casey. Don't talk. I can't
hear you. Go home. Repeat: go home.

591
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,250
Do not call the cops;
don't do anything. Go home.

592
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,270
Casey?Casey?

593
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,670
Chuck: they're taking
them to the bamboo dragon.

594
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,280
Chuck: okay, okay. All right.

595
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,750
What are the rules for tailing?

596
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,010
Tail rules.

597
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,730
30... 30 yards.

598
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,370
Or was it 30 feet?

599
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,040
I should've taken notes.

600
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Chuck: oh, god.

601
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,190
* hey, chuck, it's ellie.

602
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,860
Well, you've officially missed mother's
day, which is a first, i might add.

603
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,220
I just... I don't know what
happened to you tonight, or...

604
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,420
In general.

605
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
You know, the least that
you could have done was call.

606
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,950
Anyway, um...

607
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,100
Forget it. Bye.

608
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,310
Let me guess, chuck's
not here, right?

609
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,520
That is becoming
common around here.

610
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,870
Yeah, tell me about it.

611
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,290
I can't believe chuck
missed mother's day.

612
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,670
You know, all i wanted was for him to meet a great
girl, and he finally did, and now i never see him.

613
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,560
You know what?

614
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,930
Maybe we sit chuck down and force
him to break up with sarah, you know?

615
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,900
Dump her completely.

616
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,410
Who needs her?

617
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,630
Kidding. Kidding, kind of.

618
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,720
It's not that i'm not happy
for him, i just miss him.

619
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,040
No, i get it.

620
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,040
Chuck's been through
some tough times.

621
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,600
Getting kicked out of stanford,
and then jill breaking up with him.

622
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,650
You know, you got
him through all that,

623
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,140
and no one knows that better
than he does, believe me.

624
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,040
How are things at work?
- Oh, awful. Thank you for asking.

625
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,210
There's this, uh, sales competition,
and i'm pretty much last.

626
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,340
So what are you gonna do?

627
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,190
Same thing i always do: get fired.

628
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,270
Are you sure that
you want to do that?

629
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,770
Truth is, chuck and i always
complain how boring the buy more is.

630
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,900
So tomorrow i'm just gonna go up to big mike
and do the only honorable thing left to do.

631
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,820
What's that?

632
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,050
Well, what any respectable warrior like
bruce lee would do: fall on my sword.

633
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,910
Hari-kari.

634
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,580
Fire myself.

635
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,500
You mean resign?

636
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,810
Yeah, okay, that
sounds better, i guess.

637
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,030
Oh, god...

638
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,130
Please let me keep my fingers.

639
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,770
Come on. Come on.

640
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You can yell at me later.

641
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,850
This is the part where we hide.

642
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Ben lo pan's getting away.

643
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
Wait here, wait here.

644
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,400
Forget it, ben.

645
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,340
It's chinatown. You
ever see that movie?

646
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,920
Ellie...

647
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,780
Ellie, i am so, so, so sorry.

648
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,510
What happened, chuck?

649
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,010
Were you kidnapped or something?

650
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,670
Me?

651
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,750
No. No, no.

652
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,850
I, uh, went over to casey's.

653
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,410
I went to casey's, chuck.

654
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,510
No one was there.

655
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,290
When did we start keeping
secrets from one another?

656
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,850
You know what, look,
if-if you'll just...

657
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,790
If you'll just let me explain...

658
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,000
There's no need
- i figured it out.

659
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,650
I know.

660
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,790
You do?

661
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:30,510
You have another girlfriend for
a long time, and you're in love.

662
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Yeah.

663
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,230
I am... Lying to me.

664
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,980
Missing our most
important day like...

665
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,420
Like you're in high school.

666
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,570
I mean, do you even know that
morgan's about to be fired?

667
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,920
Ellie, i can't apologize enough.

668
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,080
I...

669
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,010
Everything that
you're saying is right.

670
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,920
I guess that i'm just so, um...

671
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,990
I'm, i'm so head over heals, um, that
i'm not thinking straight, you know?

672
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,000
Listen, i know that this is the first
big thing to happen to you in a while.

673
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,200
And you feel like your
life isn't going anywhere.

674
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,630
Your job's not either, and you're
not superman out there saving the day.

675
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,850
But you're good person, chuck.

676
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,640
You're a good brother
and you're a good friend.

677
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,130
Don't lose that.

678
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,200
Do you think, do you think
maybe that we could, uh...

679
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,545
Reschedule mother's
day, like, tomorrow?

680
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:29,070
I know that that is ridiculously unorthodox i get that,
and i know that it's my fault that we even have to do it,

681
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:35,080
but, um, i mean it is our holiday.

682
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,610
So, i think we could
make up around the rules.

683
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,110
I say, yes, you'll be there.

684
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,530
I promise.

685
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:51,760
You know, if there's anything going with
you- life, girl, job- you can come to me.

686
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,210
What's that?

687
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,580
My letter of resignation.

688
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,820
You got a new job?

689
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,250
No.

690
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,560
Didn't t think anyone else
is stupid enough to hire you.

691
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,530
So what's up?

692
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,050
I'm last in the competition.

693
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,590
Yeah, i know it's a shock
that i'm last, but...

694
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,080
Here we are.

695
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,250
And now i fall on my sword.

696
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,600
Head high, dignity intact.

697
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,400
It's the shaolin way.

698
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Hey, 'morning.

699
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
There's a whale on the
line demanding to see you.

700
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,540
Yeah, a fish is calling?

701
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,270
No, you, bearded buffoon.

702
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,255
A big spender.

703
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:50,770
She wants to see you at checkout.

704
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,880
Ellie?

705
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,940
Hey.

706
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,290
I already know what i'm getting
chuck and devon for their birthdays,

707
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,480
so i figured i'd do
some shopping early.

708
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,090
That'll be $733.42, ma'am.

709
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,340
Did anyone help you?

710
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
He did.

711
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,630
I... Love you.

712
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,790
Big man, knock wood.

713
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,650
No.

714
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,590
Good.

715
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,200
You're my only hispanic
on the sales team.

716
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,770
You quit, the affirmative action
goons will be all over my ass.

717
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,320
O
- kay.

718
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,380
Well, listen, i sold over
$700 worth of stereo equipment.

719
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,800
Puts me in second place.

720
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,950
Means somebody owes me a
pizza with two toppings.

721
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,400
Pizza's for me, partner.

722
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,390
Do i get an iphone?

723
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,320
I don't even get a free iphone.

724
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,120
You think i'd give you jerks one?

725
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,920
There are no prizes?

726
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,260
And no one's getting fired.

727
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,700
The competition was to
get you bums to work hard.

728
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Looks like it worked.

729
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,930
* look, i'm... I'm sorry, you guys.

730
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,740
I know that you wanted
me to go home, but i...

731
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,260
I just couldn't, you know.

732
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,620
We just turned one
of china's top spies.

733
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,710
And you helped save her brother.

734
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,810
So, good work, chuck.

735
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,690
Why, i'd better be going.

736
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,120
Got my own family
reunion to attend.

737
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,150
Thank you...

738
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,390
Chuck.

739
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,630
Oh, yeah, hey...

740
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,420
Don't... Don't mention it.

741
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,120
You're welcome.

742
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,300
Uh, but before you go, would you
mind, uh, would you mind signing this?

743
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,000
What is that?

744
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Oh, it just says that i was
off-site fixing your computer

745
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,840
and that you're satisfied with the
level of customer service i provided.

746
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,200
Hey, chuck!

747
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,200
Morgan?

748
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,410
Morgan, what are you do...

749
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,480
Bu-buddy, i know that i
haven't been around lately,

750
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,220
and/or really been the best of friend,
but, uh, you know that ellie and i have...

751
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,430
Mother's day, man,
i know... I get it.

752
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,610
Okay, hey, it's
okay. I invited him.

753
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,710
Yeah, yeah, and i told you he's gonna
come walking through that door, didn't i?

754
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,810
He's such a good kid.

755
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
I'm going to get some glasses.

756
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,370
What the...

757
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,530
We bonded over an "i
miss chuck" moment.

758
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,630
Did you?

759
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,240
Where's, uh, where's awesome?

760
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
He couldn't get off work.

761
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,860
That must be sarah.

762
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,330
What, you invited her, too?

763
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,380
Well, i mean, she's your new
best gal. How could i not?

764
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,540
Ellie, you know you'll
always be my best gal.

765
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,930
Don't take this the wrong
way, chuck, but i hope not.

766
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,480
Yeah, morgan, now sara?

767
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,990
It used to be just the two of us.

768
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,090
Well, we're growing up.

769
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,950
Ellie invited me. She,
uh, insisted that i come.

770
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,850
So, uh, mother's day.

771
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,040
Yes, mother's day, that's right.

772
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,140
You don't really know...

773
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,710
Mother's day is the anniversary
of the day our mom...

774
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,040
Left us.

775
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,360
Our dad was her, but he
was never really here.

776
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,340
So, now, every year we celebrate the day
we learn how to take care of ourselves.

777
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
And rely on each other.

778
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,190
Ellie, here i come.

779
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,290
I think we're gonna need
some more champagne,.

780
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,460
I heard you came in second
place, thanks to ellie.

781
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,120
Chuck, i've been slow
playing for years, you know,

782
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,160
and just sort of waiting in second position
until she pretty much couldn't resist me anymore.

783
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,260
Is that right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

784
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,600
I would have liked your
blessing before i marry her.

785
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,970
Oh, well, you know,
whatever ellie wants.

786
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,920
I know, but are you ready
to be my brother-in-law?

787
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,260
Have a few morgan
bartowskis running around?

788
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,880
Or ellie barettas?

789
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,660
I would change my last name
to baretta for her, you know, '

790
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
cause i think she deserves
a last name that cool.

791
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,370
You know, ellie macgyver or
ellie headroom, ellie rambo or...

792
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,490
She's behind me right
now, isn't she? - Mm-hmm.

793
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,770
Heard everything?

794
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,870
Pretty much, yeah.

795
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,270
I guess i'm going home.

796
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,360
I can't believe it.

797
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,140
For 12 whole hours, my best friend
and my sister actually got along.

798
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,770
A mother's day miracle.

799
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,970
Happy mother's day.
