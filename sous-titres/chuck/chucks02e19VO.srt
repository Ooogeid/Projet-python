1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,070
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,700
<i>Here are a few things that
you might need to know.</i>

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,080
Is there any way that Intersect
images can be taken out?

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,055
Can it be removed?

5
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,135
<i>Only Orion would know.</i>

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,250
- Orion.
- <i>Hello, Chuck.</i>

7
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,080
<i>It's good to finally
see you face-to-face.</i>

8
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,363
<i>Those cards
you're looking at</i>

9
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:12,650
<i>are the schematics
for the new Intersect.</i>

10
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,176
<i>Study them.</i>

11
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>If you can find
FULCRUM's Intersect,</i>

12
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,580
<i>you could get your
old life back.</i>

13
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,870
I promised Ellie that I'd find
dad to walk her down the aisle

14
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,337
<i>but I've tried everything.
He's nowhere;</i>

15
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:22,174
<i>it's like he's fallen of the
face of the Earth.</i>

16
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,488
Dad.

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,795
I'm sort of
freaking out here.

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,030
I know.

19
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,640
But he's your father,
and he seemed happy to see you.

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,294
You think?

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,087
I thought it was just lack of
recognition followed by shock.

22
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,634
- You take cream?
- Huh?

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,430
Yeah. No.

24
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,280
Whatever's fine.

25
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,113
I can't even remember
if I take cream.

26
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,790
- Just relax.
- How?

27
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,610
I-I haven't... I haven't seen
my dad for, like, ten years,

28
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,970
and now I'm sitting in his
living room/kitchenette

29
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,340
while he's making us coffee.

30
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,907
Plus, let's just say the
last time I saw him,

31
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,934
he was kind of--

32
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,835
<i>I mean, he tended to be a little...</i>
What's the word? Crazy.

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,197
Here we go.

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,307
Thanks.

35
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,605
So good to see
that face again.

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,793
Yeah, yours, too.

37
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,909
So, uh,
you doing okay?

38
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,634
Who cares about me?

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,859
Tell me about you.

40
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,810
Uh, well, you know, there's not,
there's not much to tell.

41
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,056
Graduated from
high school.

42
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:42,185
Went to Stanford.
Work at Buy More.

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,467
Stanford.
Not bad.

44
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,043
He always was a genius--
this one.

45
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,710
No, not like you.

46
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,904
You're right.
He was smarter.

47
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,010
What about Ellie?
How is she?

48
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,897
Really great, actually.
Umm...

49
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,997
She's a doctor now.

50
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,580
And-and in a few weeks,
she's gonna get married to,

51
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,861
<i>well,
an-an awesome guy.</i>

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,561
Ellie's getting married?

53
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,558
She is.

54
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,462
That, uh, that's actually
mainly why we're here.

55
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,721
Ellie was really hoping

56
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,869
that you might be there
to walk her down the aisle.

57
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,247
I don't think
she would want me there.

58
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,250
I-I mean, of course,
of course she does.

59
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,076
We both do.

60
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,111
It's not a good idea.

61
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,521
<i>But tell her
that I'm happy for her.</i>

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,370
Are you, are you joking?
You have to do this.

63
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,880
<i>She's your daughter.
Don't you want to be there?</i>

64
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,290
Charles, I can't...

65
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,540
I-I don't want to hear
what you can't do.

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,352
I've seen
what you can't do.

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,947
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

68
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,280
That came out wrong.

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,070
No, it didn't.

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,789
You're mad.

71
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,779
I left,
and-and you're mad.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,580
Look, Dad, I'm not even
here for me really, okay?

73
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,454
Right now, I just...

74
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,587
I want you to come
home for Ellie, please.

75
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,434
I like you coming up here
and fighting for Ellie.

76
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,156
Makes me happy you...

77
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,411
at least
had each other.

78
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,130
Let me get
a few things together.

79
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,027
Are you okay?

80
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,333
Yeah, I think so.

81
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,303
I mean,
I'm glad we found him for Ellie.

82
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,592
And for you?

83
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,035
Yeah.

84
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,224
Maybe he's not as crazy
as I remembered.

85
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,105
<i>Okay.</i>

86
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,942
Let's go get
your sister married, huh?

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,782
Maybe we should wait till dark.
They're...

88
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,155
They're tracking
my every move.

89
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,906
<i>Rat bastards.</i>

94
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,065
<i>So, I was thinking that</i>

95
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:58,350
this would be perfect
for the rehearsal dinner

96
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,985
'cause if I wear that

97
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:00,600
<i>sage dress,
this will match perfectly.</i>

98
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,485
- Sounds good.
- Or...

99
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,533
Ellie, hey.

100
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,650
Hey, Chuck.
Just a sec.

101
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,641
We could do
the cranberry,

102
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,896
which would really bring
out your, um, your...

103
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,619
Hello, Eleanor.

104
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,681
Aren't you
gonna say something?

105
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,742
Pancakes.

106
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,423
Oh, boy.

107
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,670
You said you were
gonna make pancakes.

108
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,342
Well,
that-that went well.

109
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:53,799
Hey.

110
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,027
You must be Devon.

111
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,852
Yeah.

112
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,630
Big TV.

113
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,860
Ellie, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,870
I should have called first.

115
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,480
A surprise of this magnitude
wasn't the best idea.

116
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,868
No, it's not your fault.

117
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,085
I'm just...

118
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,810
so mad at him,
our crazy old dad.

119
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,013
Aren't you mad at him?

120
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,540
I was, yeah.

121
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,479
But then,
I realized that...

122
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,280
You know, we can hate him
for the rest of our lives,

123
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,671
or we can choose
to forgive him.

124
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,405
It's easier to hate him.

125
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,980
Well, that may be.

126
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,096
But he's all
we got left, El.

127
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,649
This could be our last chance
at being a family again.

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,328
Let's go.

129
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,195
I guess I was just, uh,
surprised to see you, Dad.

130
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:01,820
Yeah.

131
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,775
<i>I'm sure you were.</i>

132
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,256
God, Ellie, y-you look
just like your mother.

133
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,330
Sorry I left you
two alone like that.

134
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,706
No, no, it's fine.

135
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,497
Your dad was just explaining
our television to me.

136
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,865
I was just telling, uh,

137
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:29,889
Devon that I, um,
I practically invented your TV.

138
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,040
I came up with these
helix-shaped plasma crystals

139
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,710
back in high school.

140
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,320
Um, never saw a dime for it.

141
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,628
Okay, well, who's hungry?
<i>I'll order pizza.</i>

142
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,137
Touch-screen technology.
<i>That was one of mine.</i>

143
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,128
Uh, Ted Roark and I came up
with it back in grad school.

144
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,121
Dad, you went to school
with Ted Roark?

145
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,330
The Roark Instruments guy?
Awesome.

146
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,695
Yeah,
he took all my ideas,

147
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:54,360
<i>and, uh,
I-I never got anything.</i>

148
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,511
<i>Guy's a...</i>
lying thief.

149
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,600
Well, how about I, uh,
order the pizza. Pepperoni?

150
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,330
Roark's releasing a
new software this week

151
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,910
<i>that I guarantee has components
that I helped develop.</i>

152
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,406
Yeah,
pepperoni sounds great, hon.

153
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,735
<i>I still have my original</i>

154
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:08,930
touch-screen schematics.

155
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,398
And I...
I want to show you.

156
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,330
Uh, D...

157
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,867
<i>Okay, guys,
I'm really trying here, but</i>

158
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,989
he is obviously
as crazy as we remember.

159
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,970
<i>It seems Chuck's
flash matches a lot of chatter</i>

160
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,339
<i>we've been hearing about
Roark Instruments lately.</i>

161
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,096
<i>The CIA now believes
Ted Roark's latest software</i>

162
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:41,746
<i>may contain a virus that,
if released,</i>

163
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,870
<i>could cause irreparable damage
to the world's computer networks.</i>

164
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,277
Why don't we just contact Roark
and tell them our concerns?

165
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,387
<i>We can't out of fear of alerting
those who might be involved.</i>

166
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,368
<i>Instead, we're going
to send in Chuck</i>

167
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,810
<i>as a new RI employee.</i>

168
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,798
<i>You will see if you flash
on anyone or anything.</i>

169
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,583
<i>Your interview
is in one hour.</i>

170
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,285
Are you okay
with that?

171
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:03,440
Why wouldn't he be?

172
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
Well, his dad went to school
with Roark.

173
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,229
There could be
some history there.

174
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,386
Your daddy issues gonna
jeopardize our mission?

175
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,847
No, no, I'm fine.

176
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,890
I mean, forget Apple.
Forget Microsoft.

177
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,914
I've dreamt of
working for Roark since college.

178
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,056
Although, does it actually
qualify as a dream come true

179
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,180
if I go in as a janitor?

180
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,300
You're going in as
Charles Bartowski.

181
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,482
Your name, your resume,
your Stanford degree.

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,791
Really?

183
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,167
You're perfectly qualified
to go in as yourself.

184
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,718
Me at RI?

185
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,249
Oh, hey.

186
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,955
You must be Chuck.

187
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,317
<i>I'm Drew.</i>

188
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,707
Welcome to
Roark Instruments,

189
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:03,046
<i>where the
future happens first.</i>

190
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,980
I love it here.

191
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:04,687
<i>Huh.</i>

192
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,360
<i>Everyone does.</i>

193
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,607
Please,
have a seat.

194
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,525
Oh, ri--uh, here, yeah.

195
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,310
Sorry.
I'm not nor...

196
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,428
So, I see
you went to Stanford.

197
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,212
Me, too.
Class of '07.

198
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,030
'07, wow.

199
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,838
You-you've only been out
a couple of years?

200
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,924
That's eons
in the software game.

201
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,736
Come on.
Where you been?

202
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,400
Seriously, tell me what you're up to
since you graduated.

203
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,236
Uh, well, uh...

204
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,573
<i>What have I been up to?
Uh...</i>

205
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,471
Chuck, just be honest.

206
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,810
Um, I've actually been
working at a Buy More, um...

207
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,940
in the Nerd Herd division,

208
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,135
which, you know,
has given me

209
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,540
quite a bit of experience
working with,

210
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,899
you know,
different computers,

211
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,520
<i>operating systems,
technologies.</i>

212
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,024
<i>You know, I've gotten
the opportunity to work</i>

213
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:09,710
with many different...
unusual personalities.

214
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,571
- Good morning, Big Michael!
- Woah!

215
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
Where the hell
did you come from?

216
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,850
We have a
proposition for you.

217
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,810
I'll pass.
Excuse me.

218
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,162
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

219
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,914
Two words:
NextExpo.

220
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,550
- That's one word.
- Stop counting.

221
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,738
Tomorrow is Roark's
Next Technology Expo

222
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:33,390
<i>where they're
gonna be releasing</i>

223
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,480
<i>their new operating
system to the entire world.</i>

224
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,757
Now, we believe...

225
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:40,650
that attending that release
will make us better employees.

226
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,046
And better human beings.

227
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,908
- NextExpo, huh?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,906
Good thinking.

229
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,124
Send Bartowski.

230
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,062
- Chuck's not here.
- As usual.

231
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,033
Okay, fine.

232
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,920
<i>You both can go.</i>

233
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,981
<i>Have fun camping out</i>

234
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,250
at the
weirdo convention.

235
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,350
<i>I would say probably
my greatest weakness is</i>

236
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,355
how little I pushed
myself since college.

237
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,029
I've been trapped in a job,

238
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:07,971
<i>a life that I don't
really want, but...</i>

239
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,421
Don't really
see a way out.

240
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,228
Being here's a good start.

241
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,652
Well, clearly,
you're qualified.

242
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,205
And it doesn't hurt that
you're a fellow Stanford alum.

243
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,245
I'd love for you
to take the job.

244
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,529
Really?

245
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,122
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

246
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,480
Congratulations, Chuck.

247
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,085
Wow, thanks!
W-Wait.

248
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,599
Here we go.

249
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:29,818
- There we go.
- There we go.

250
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:30,698
- Okay.
- Bye.

251
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,141
We'll work on those
ball skills.

252
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,390
Hey, what's that?

253
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,364
The lobby.

254
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,802
- What's that?
- Elevator.

255
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,629
- What's that?
- The bathroom.

256
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,264
Man, this place is awesome!

257
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,043
Over there's R&D,

258
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,063
and that hallway
leads to our testing facilities.

259
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,790
Sorry about the
shortened tour.

260
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,620
We've been so busy with
this software release.

261
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,317
All right.

262
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,283
Right around here is...

263
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,261
Hey, Ted,
this is Chuck,

264
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:11,072
<i>our new employee.</i>

265
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:12,837
Hey, welcome to RI.

266
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,472
Never wash that hand.

267
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,945
I never will, sir.

268
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,646
No "sirs" around here.
Except for her.

269
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,646
Well...
Okay, Ted.

270
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,659
It's just a...

271
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,190
It's just an honor to be here
and working for your company.

272
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,755
Well, easy, big boy.
You already got the gig.

273
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,226
Ready to
take over the world?

274
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,838
Only 24 hours of camping
and NextExpo is ours.

275
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,497
Because...

276
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:48,367
<i>- Hey.
- I don't know what to say.</i>

277
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,230
<i>I'm a little speechless.</i>

278
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:50,280
<i>Welcome to the team.</i>

279
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,199
Happy to
have you aboard.

280
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,702
Oh, yeah. Uh...

281
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:53,500
Wow.

282
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,312
Think Morgan knows that Chuck's
cheating on the Buy More?

283
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,772
<i>You know your boyfriend
just took a job at Roark?</i>

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,705
Of course,
I was the first one he told.

285
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,803
<i>You guys are over.</i>

286
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,307
Yeah, okay.

287
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,582
<i>It's weird.</i>

288
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,720
<i>Even though I know
it's not real,</i>

289
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,565
I am excited about this job.

290
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,073
Chuck, you got to remember
it's just an assignment.

291
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,697
No, I-I mean, I know...
I know what it is.

292
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:17,307
I just...

293
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,620
If I had gotten this job at
Roark right after college,

294
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,819
maybe I'd never become
the Intersect.

295
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,350
Then when my dad comes
back after ten years,

296
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,067
I can show him that I'm not
just another loser

297
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:27,950
working at a Buy More.

298
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,726
Chuck, he knows
you're not a loser.

299
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,069
Well, I'm sure he hoped
I'd be doing something

300
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:33,377
a little bigger than
Nerd Herding.

301
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,298
You are.

302
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:37,902
<i>Cheers!</i>

303
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,396
Charles!

304
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,800
Perfect timing,
you two.

305
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
- Oh, wow, I'm so starving...
- <i>Hey.</i>

306
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,276
been sitting and waiting!
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,067
Where you been?

308
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,401
<i>Ah, well,
you know, working</i>

309
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:53,876
saving the lives of small
technological devices.

310
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,156
<i>How about a toast?</i>

311
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,593
To family.

312
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,431
<i>Uh, Dad,</i>

313
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:01,872
we are extremely grateful
to have you home.

314
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,929
Yes, we are.

315
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,808
<i>Welcome.</i>

316
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,555
<i>Thank you.</i>

317
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,910
And-and,
here's to you and Devon.

318
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,747
May you live
happily together forever.

319
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,831
You deserve it.

320
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,550
- Thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

321
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,694
When's the bachelor party?

322
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,460
I, um,
I already had it.

323
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,183
<i>And?</i>

324
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:21,852
<i>How was it?</i>

325
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,409
Oh, I don't really
want to talk about it.

326
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:28,396
Well, okay, I got one.
How about um, to Chuck's new job?

327
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,766
- What?
- <i>That's what I hear.</i>

328
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,860
<i>You know,
Lester tells me that</i>

329
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:32,800
you're leaving
your old buddy

330
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,616
and the Buy More behind

331
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:37,394
<i>to go all corporate over at</i>
Roark Instruments,

332
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,813
<i>which, I get it,
pretty cool. So...</i>

333
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,989
<i>Good luck, buddy.</i>

334
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,855
Chuck, that's amazing.

335
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,331
You going to work
for Roark?

336
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,597
The man who stole everything
from me?

337
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,410
Either this is a mission
or you two

338
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:09,039
are very good
at hiding your hobbies.

339
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,526
We're going in to
retrieve the source code

340
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:11,790
for the new operating system.

341
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,243
Without it, Roark can't release
the software or the virus.

342
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,310
It's gonna take time to break
in the secured vault.

343
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,552
Look, we need you to keep
an eye on Roark

344
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:19,080
in case
anything goes wrong.

345
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,190
Keep an eye on Roark?

346
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,699
- What--
- Have a nice first day.

347
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,523
<i>Everyone,
welcome to NextExpo 2009.</i>

348
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,299
<i>Please.
One at a time.</i>

349
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,924
<i>Miss, stay in line.</i>

350
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,616
<i>Miss, hey--</i>

351
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,720
Chuck!

352
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,290
Hey, Chuck! Chuck, over here.
Chuck! Charles!

353
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,002
He's already forgotten us.

354
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,484
It's like he looked right
through me.

355
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,460
Hey, not to add any extra
pressure to you guys,

356
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,530
<i>but there's a
FULCRUM agent here.</i>

357
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,220
<i>He's some kind of
computer terrorist.</i>

358
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,941
Well, if FULCRUM is here,
it's even more vital

359
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,176
<i>that we stop this launch.</i>

360
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,393
Arigato.

361
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,897
In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

362
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,116
Then you better hurry up.

363
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,554
<i>Roark's about to
take the stage.</i>

364
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,285
<i>Access denied.
Have an amazing day.</i>

365
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,027
Damn it.
I'm gonna need to do a patch.

366
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,946
Dad, you're really not
gonna watch that, are you?

367
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,561
<i>I have to watch
Chuck's first day</i>

368
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,366
<i>even if he is
working for Roark.</i>

369
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,593
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

370
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:48,450
<i>please welcome
the architect of the digital age</i>

371
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,504
<i>and Time magazine's Man of the Year:
Ted Roark.</i>

372
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,467
<i>Thank you.
Welcome to NextExpo 2009!</i>

373
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,776
Or as I like to call it,
"Ted Greets the Little People."

374
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:09,435
Just kidding.

375
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,690
You believe this guy?

376
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,226
<i>We've done some amazing
things this year.</i>

377
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,300
<i>At least I have.
I mean, I...</i>

378
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,647
<i>traveled around the
world in a hot air balloon...</i>

379
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:20,937
uh, bought another island.

380
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,524
<i>It's private.
Don't visit.</i>

381
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,289
What else?
Let's see. Oh!

382
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,616
And we invented a new
operating system

383
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:30,212
that's going to
change the world!

384
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,240
<i>Let's not waste
any more time.</i>

385
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,541
<i>Do you have any idea
how much money I'm losing</i>

386
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,384
<i>just standing here?</i>

387
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,088
By pressing this button,
RIOS will be released.

388
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,315
The whole world will have access,
free access to our latest software.

389
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,370
It's happening.

390
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,729
We're encountering security
we've never seen before.

391
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,231
<i>Access denied again.
That's twice.</i>

392
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,982
<i>Maybe I should call
security.</i>

393
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,020
Uh-oh.

394
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,789
Please tell me that was
a good "Uh-oh."

395
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,081
<i>You know,
I love a countdown!</i>

396
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,858
I'd like you to join me.
Ready?

397
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,323
<i>Ten...</i>

398
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,600
There's a countdown
happening.

399
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,900
Okay, Chuck, listen,
we cannot access the source code.

400
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,580
<i>You're gonna have to just,
just stop the release.</i>

401
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,438
But I could get fired!

402
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,956
It's not your real job.
Hurry.

403
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:26,622
Six, five, four,
three, two...

404
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,922
- No, wait!
- One!

405
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,987
What the hell
are you doing?

406
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,654
<i>Is that Chuck?</i>

407
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
Wow, he's on stage.

408
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,464
He must have
gotten promoted.

409
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,710
No, no water pass
right now, okay?

410
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,950
Get off the stage.

411
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:46,340
I, uh, I... I, uh, I can't.
I can't. I'm so--

412
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,715
<i>- Get off the stage!
- Go! Come on!</i>

413
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,154
<i>Don't deny us
our new software, nerd!</i>

414
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,507
You can't press that button.

415
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,622
The CIA believes
that your software

416
00:19:55,684 --> 00:19:59,105
has been infected with a virus,
that when released,

417
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,739
will cause
worldwide computer damage.

418
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,870
Do you have any idea
how crazy you sound?

419
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,150
Yeah, I do.
I do.

420
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,240
But please,
you have to believe me.

421
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,430
No, I really...
I really don't.

422
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,980
I'm sorry for the
little technical delay.

423
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,013
It must be
my rock star magnetism.

424
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,056
<i>It drives
some people batty.</i>

425
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,988
- Go, Charles!
- No, Chuck!

426
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:33,559
- Go!
- Stop!

427
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,130
That's great!

428
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,864
That's my boy!

429
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,681
Oh, no!

430
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,438
And you call yourself
a Stanford man.

431
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,879
<i>Let's get back to it.</i>

432
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,625
Three, two, one...

433
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,091
Have you heard
from my brother?

434
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,423
Was I supposed to
hear from your brother?

435
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,520
Chuck is not picking up.
Do you think he's in jail?

436
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,780
Do you get a phone call
when you're in jail?

437
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,328
In the movies, you get a phone call.
I don't know.

438
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,392
I'm going to call 411.
Who do I ask for, the county jail?

439
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:42,620
Ellie, I just worked an
18-hour shift.

440
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,580
Now just slow down, honey.
Tell me what happened.

441
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,808
Chuck freaked out.

442
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,220
He hopped on stage at
some computer convention

443
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,290
and tried to
attack his new boss.

444
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,567
What?
Why would he do that?

445
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,745
I have no idea.

446
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,575
Although, we should
probably ask my dad.

447
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,869
Since obviously,
you put him up to it.

448
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,719
What?

449
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,240
I didn't tell him
to do anything.

450
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,870
Come on, Dad.

451
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,840
Why else would he
throw away a job of a lifetime?

452
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,110
Ted Roark isn't worthy of
your brother or his talents.

453
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,412
It was a lousy job.

454
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,790
And what do you call
working at the Buy More, Dad?

455
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,934
Don't you get it?

456
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,170
Chuck has been waiting for
ten years to impress you,

457
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,260
and now this
opportunity comes along

458
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,416
where he can follow
through on some crazy

459
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,050
made-up vendetta
of yours.

460
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,480
Trust me, sweetie.

461
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,357
Your brother knows
what he's doing.

462
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,534
You want me
to trust you?

463
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:28,959
Ellie, maybe your dad's right.

464
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,545
Maybe-maybe Chuck has
got a good explanation.

465
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,920
Sure, Devon,
I'm sure he does.

466
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,080
He probably just forgot the
whole thing happened, right?

467
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,304
Just like
at your bachelor party.

468
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,848
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:44,190
I don't want
to drag us into this.

470
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,090
I'm just really
worked up right now. So..

471
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,042
I'm going to...
take a walk.

472
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,258
- Ellie...
- Let her walk, Devon.

473
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,747
Drink?

474
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,384
No, no way.

475
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:00,892
<i>That's what got me
in trouble in the first place.</i>

476
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,208
What do I do?

477
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,657
You're asking
the wrong guy.

478
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,065
She's your daughter.

479
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,865
Well,
I can't take credit for her.

480
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,131
The only thing Ellie owes me is
a few well-deserved trust issues.

481
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,462
You really
want my advice?

482
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,635
Don't walk out
on your kids when

483
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,508
you promised them
pancakes for dinner. They...

484
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,451
tend to take it badly.

485
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,768
You're a...

486
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,447
real straight arrow,
aren't you?

487
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,962
I used to be;
before this damn bachelor party.

488
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,891
God, I'm such a jackass.

489
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,925
Maybe.

490
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,433
But that's not
why Ellie's mad.

491
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,265
She just doesn't want you
to turn into me, which...

492
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,919
take this as
a compliment--

493
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,540
seems pretty damn unlikely.

494
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,896
So come on,
have a drink.

495
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,446
To straight arrows.

496
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,156
Okay, all right.

497
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,513
Show me what you
want me to do.

498
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,672
<i>Why did you send me
these cards, Orion?</i>

499
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,379
<i>Do you want me to
build an Intersect?</i>

500
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:42,191
Or find an Intersect?</i>

501
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,739
<i>How can I use these cards
to find an Intersect?</i>

502
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,400
Hey, I'm a little...
I'm a little busy right now.

503
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,632
Just give me one minute.

504
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,289
<i>And then you can go back
to whatever you were doing.</i>

505
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,640
Ellie thinks you did what
you did at Roark for me,

506
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,112
and if that's true,
I'll never forgive myself...

507
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,954
- Dad--
- Still my minute?

508
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,170
I ruined every good thing
that ever happened to me.

509
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,494
My family, my job,
my entire life, thrown away.

510
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,800
I won't stand by and
let the same thing happen to you.

511
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,302
That's one torch
I'd rather not pass.

512
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,900
If working for Roark is-is
that important to you,

513
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,642
<i>then I-I think
you should fight for it.</i>

514
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,896
And don't let my past
destroy your future.

515
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,789
I miss getting advice
from you.

516
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,652
Well, my minute's up.

517
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,485
You were in the
middle of something.

518
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,148
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

519
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,619
Roark has an Intersect.

520
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,319
What?

521
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,750
An Intersect.
Roark has one.

522
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,966
You thinks Roark is
hiding a supercomputer,

523
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:56,020
the size of a football field,
<i>inside his office.</i>

524
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,728
Yes!

525
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,155
Well, maybe.

526
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,730
What exactly
did you flash on?

527
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,683
I...

528
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,629
I...

529
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,532
I didn't. I didn't.

530
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,310
I didn't flash on
anything technically.

531
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,140
I was just thinking.
But it makes sense.

532
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,954
We know that
FULCRUM is working on

533
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:14,700
trying to implant
intel into their agents,

534
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,250
but they still need
a supercomputer--

535
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,526
an Intersect,
to crunch all that data.

536
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,546
Only someone like Roark
could do that.

537
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,970
Ted Roark
is working for FULCRUM?

538
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,020
<i>I know it sounds crazy,</i>

539
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:25,340
but what if RIOS
is actually a Trojan horse?

540
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,520
Like a virus designed to steal
intel from the government,

541
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,704
corporations,
anybody, everybody.

542
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:32,593
And you just thought this up,
out of the blue?

543
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,284
<i>No flash, no proof?</i>

544
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,920
Beckman will laugh
in our faces.

545
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,458
Guess the apple doesn't fall too far
from the crazy tree, does it?

546
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,749
<i>I'm sorry, Chuck.</i>

547
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,176
Sarah...
Sarah...

548
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,594
Think about what it could mean
if Roark has an Intersect.

549
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,840
I could finally get this
thing out of my head.

550
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,165
I need your help
to break into Roark's office.

551
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,510
Beckman's orders
are clear.

552
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,737
So are the consequences
of not following them.

553
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,306
I'm sorry.

554
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,327
Cute outfit,
Bartowski.

555
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,774
- Give me that back.
- First, you tell me what it is.

556
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,324
Interesting question.

557
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,915
Those are designs
for the Intersect.

558
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,939
You stole Roark's designs.

559
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,590
Orion's.

560
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,450
He sent them to me
before he died.

561
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,808
There's a map
hidden in the plans

562
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,480
that matches to layout
of Roark Instruments.

563
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,731
Orion contacted you
and you didn't tell us?

564
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,790
I think he wanted me
to break in.

565
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,077
Yeah, and I want you to
take off my gear

566
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:53,335
before I break your
geek neck.

567
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,270
- Oh.
- I know what I'm doing.

568
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,414
You have no idea.

569
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,524
You're entering a
world of pain, Chuck.

570
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,130
I want this Intersect
out of my head.

571
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,250
Are you going to
help me or not?

572
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,328
You got to be...

573
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,689
Is that a tranq gun?

574
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,618
You don't even have the common
courtesy to threaten me

575
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:17,640
with an actual firearm.

576
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,657
What's your answer, Casey?

577
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,830
Put the toy down and
get your ass back...

578
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,038
I'm going to kill you
when I wake up.

579
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,603
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

580
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,187
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

581
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:33,775
<i>That's the oldest excuse
in the book.</i>

582
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,062
<i>Yes, he knows me.</i>

583
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,882
I want to see Ted Roark.

584
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,157
- Just calm down.
- Look.

585
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:40,115
<i>He might have
screwed me,</i>

586
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:42,466
but I'm not going to let that
son of a bitch screw my son.

587
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:43,980
Get your own hands
off of me!

588
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,430
<i>Listen, you tell your boss
I'm not leaving this building</i>

589
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,226
until my boy
gets his job back!

590
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,172
What are you doing, Dad?

591
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,566
What do you want me
to do with him?

592
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,944
<i>Bring him in.</i>

593
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,488
<i>We'll deal with it
in private.</i>

594
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,080
Excuse me.

595
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,972
Are you in charge
of these meatheads?

596
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,920
Dad, Dad, Dad,
we have to go.

597
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,900
We have to go right now.

598
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,080
I can explain all of this
to you later.

599
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,693
For now,
all I can tell you is...

600
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,026
I'm not who you
think I am.

601
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,453
It's good to
see you again.

602
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,760
Good to see
both of you.

603
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,978
Don't worry, Charles.

604
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,075
I'm not who you
think I am either.

605
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,061
<i>Hands up.</i>

606
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,239
Are you coming?

607
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,389
<i>We should go,
Charles.</i>

608
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,689
Oh, my God.

609
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,098
You're Orion.

610
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,821
We should hurry.

611
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,898
Casey,
where's Chuck?

612
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,268
In a world of pain.

613
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,882
I can't believe this.

614
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,849
My father
invented the Intersect.

615
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,063
That's not true.

616
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,916
I didn't invent all of it.
Just...

617
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,517
The really cool stuff.

618
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,051
Come on.

619
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,173
Granted, I can understand
how this might

620
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:58,450
complicate a few things.
This way.

621
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,668
What?
Complicate a few things?

622
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:00,560
Dad, I saw you die!

623
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,200
I saw you explode
in the helicopter.

624
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,246
But I see how I could've
given you that impression.

625
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,884
I've had to die
quite a few times.

626
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,469
One of the perils
of being Orion.

627
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,837
This isn't
what I wanted, Chuck.

628
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,106
But when I realized
what the government

629
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:13,290
<i>was going to do
with the Intersect,</i>

630
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,364
<i>I had to run.</i>

631
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,776
And your guys wouldn't be
the only ones

632
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,627
who are looking for me,

633
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,712
and more importantly...

634
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,079
I knew I had to stay away
from you and your sister.

635
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,267
Come on.

636
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,648
<i>Wait, Dad.</i>

637
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,576
You were protecting us?

638
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,017
I knew I'd have to spend
the rest of my life

639
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:35,635
hiding from the Intersect,
but...

640
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,421
I never imagined
that it would find you.

641
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,835
It must be such a curse to have
all those secrets

642
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:44,902
trapped in your head.

643
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,088
That's why I came back.

644
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,350
That's why I let
your handlers find me.

645
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,149
<i>It's my fault...</i>

646
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,450
that FULCRUM's
after both of us now.

647
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,947
You wanted me to flash
on your crazy schematics.

648
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,560
You wanted me
to break in here.

649
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,870
Why didn't you just say
who you were?

650
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,808
Would you have
trusted me?

651
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,530
After not seeing me for ten years,
I just appear,

652
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,310
bring you to RI and tell you that
I can get the Intersect,

653
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,690
which I also built,
out of your head?

654
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,809
What would you
have said to that?

655
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,810
That you were a
little bit crazy.

656
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,605
Exactly.

657
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,576
Now, punch in the code or
we'll be a little bit dead.

658
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,040
Listen, no, Dad,
you don't understand.

659
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,830
It doesn't work like that.

660
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,521
Unless it's in here,
I can't do it.

661
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,659
Yes, you can.

662
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,940
I designed that computer
in your head, son.

663
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,483
Flash.

664
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,523
And it'll be the last thing
you ever have to flash on.

665
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,829
Aces, Charles.

666
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,679
That's the Intersect?

667
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,529
2.0.
My baby.

668
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,564
My greatest creation.

669
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,671
After you and your sister,
of course.

670
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,976
Let's make
that the hot seat.

671
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,942
We need to make some minor
modifications to Roark's software.

672
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,130
So, uh, what exactly
does your new program do?

673
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,340
Well, usually the Intersect
works in the other way around,

674
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,665
but I don't see
any reason why

675
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,365
it shouldn't be able to
take out information.

676
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,634
In theory.
<i>At least.</i>

677
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,876
What you're going to see

678
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:55,115
are a bunch of encoded images
that will cancel out

679
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:57,192
<i>the ones
that you originally uploaded.</i>

680
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,637
Wait.

681
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,110
Are you saying you're gonna
overwrite my brain?

682
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,627
That's a good way
of putting it, yes.

683
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,016
- Ready?
- No.

684
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,805
Your glasses.

685
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,931
Oh. Yeah, right.

686
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,046
Good luck, Charles.

687
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,544
Something's wrong.

688
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,246
<i>No, no...</i>

689
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:38,381
<i>No.</i>

690
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,802
It's not working!

691
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,169
No, it doesn't work.

692
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,581
But I'm sure you'll have it up
and running in no time.

693
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,210
You always did have a way
with machines, Orion.

694
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,576
And remember?
I always had...

695
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,105
Well, I always had a way
with the girls.

696
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,565
Remember?

697
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,300
<i>Hey, come on, man.
What's the matter?</i>

698
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,473
No hug
for your old partner?

699
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,144
No?

700
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,456
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

701
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,708
<i>The years have
been unkind.</i>

702
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,164
I could offer you
a good moisturizer.

703
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,246
Huh?

704
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,664
No? Okay.

705
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,918
Put him
on the helicopter.

706
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,293
Kill the CIA agent.

707
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:23,104
He's my son.

708
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,674
He's your son?

709
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,665
Congratulations!
That's great!

710
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,754
I had no idea.
Kill the son.

711
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,460
Wait, I-I'll...

712
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,798
I'll build anything you want.

713
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,473
Give FULCRUM
their Intersect.

714
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,285
But my son walks away
from here.

715
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,111
You'll build it either way.

716
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,117
You're gonna torture me?

717
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:48,640
After ten years away
from my family?

718
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,431
My son walks away!

719
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,830
All right, all right.

720
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,150
I'm not a monster.

721
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,648
<i>I mean, I'm...</i>

722
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,953
Little bit of a monster.

723
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,554
But today
is his lucky day.

724
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,747
Shotgun on the chopper!
Let's go.

725
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,138
Charles.

726
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,116
Take care of your sister.

727
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,849
- No--
- Take care of yourself.

728
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,864
- Dad?
- You can do this without me.

729
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,318
I'm not gonna
leave you.

730
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,558
Remember when I told you
not to trust your handlers?

731
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,687
Maybe I was wrong.

732
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,305
<i>If your son's gonna walk,</i>

733
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,907
he should do it now.

734
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,439
Good-bye, Chuck.

735
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,703
No!

736
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,796
<i>In our raid of
Roark Instruments,</i>

737
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:12,923
<i>we failed to retrieve either the
Intersect or Stephen Bartowski.</i>

738
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,950
<i>Clearly, we recognize that
FULCRUM's possession of Orion</i>

739
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,000
<i>poses an unparalleled
security threat.</i>

740
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,260
You mean FULCRUM's
possession of my father.

741
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,202
<i>I promise you.</i>

742
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,451
<i>No one at the CIA knew your
father's secret identity.</i>

743
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,980
<i>I also promise to entrust
his recovery to our best team.</i>

744
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,046
General,
we are your best team!

745
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,980
Can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

746
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,842
Chuck's right.

747
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,900
No, you cannot put
Chuck back in the field.

748
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,770
It is too dangerous.

749
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,593
FULCRUM knows
that he is Orion's son.

750
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,901
Look, as soon as my dad finishes
the new Intersect for Roark,

751
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,807
I'm worthless to you.

752
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,283
<i>Obsolete.
And FULCRUM wins.</i>

753
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,497
<i>The only thing
that matters now</i>

754
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,856
is getting my father back.

755
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,922
And you need me
to do that.

756
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,820
<i>Very well,
Mr. Bartowski.</i>

757
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,184
<i>The assignment is yours.

758
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:04,230
<i>Provided your
personal entanglements,</i>

759
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,470
<i>do not interfere
with the mission.</i>

760
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,202
Dad?

761
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,683
Ellie, I don't know how
to tell you this,

762
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,481
but I think your
dad may have split.

763
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,193
His stuff's all gone.

764
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,698
Hey, hey, I'm sure he's planning on
coming back for the wedding.

765
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,762
No, no, he's not.

766
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,079
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm not going anywhere.

767
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,311
Ever.

768
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,536
I mean, no matter how
hard things get between us.

769
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,529
Because that's what
married people do, right?

770
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,206
Just think.
In 50 years, we'll walk back

771
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,773
on my bachelor party
and laugh about it.

772
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,345
No.
No, we won't.

773
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,596
Or maybe not.

774
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,759
<i>Chuck?</i>
Are you okay?

775
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,617
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Only my career was injured.

776
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,645
Chuck, um...
Dad's gone.

777
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,038
I yelled at him about what
happened at your work today.

778
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:28,630
I think
I said some things that--

779
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:29,632
Ellie, it's not your fault.

780
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,412
Well, no. It's my fault
that I asked you to find him.

781
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,940
I thought I needed him
to walk me down the aisle.

782
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,478
I thought that
he would be different

783
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:38,249
from that guy
that walked out on us.

784
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,048
I guess I just expected
too much from him.

785
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,594
Don't count him out yet.
