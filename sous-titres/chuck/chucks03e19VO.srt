1
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:09,933
Chuck! Get back here!

2
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:12,568
Mom is going to be so mad!

3
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,467
Dad, help!

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:15,999
I'm working, Charles!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,534
Uh...

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,034
she's gonna
hurt me.

7
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,267
What's going on out here?
I'm trying to work.

8
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,367
Chuck broke Mom's
favorite necklace.

9
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,867
Is that true, Charles?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,233
I didn't mean to.

11
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:38,433
Ha!

12
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:39,866
He admitted it.

13
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,033
Uh, uh. No.

14
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:42,934
Let me...
Let-Let me see.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,434
Um...

16
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:55,034
There's nothing broken
in-in this whole world

17
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:57,067
that the two of you can't fix

18
00:00:57,134 --> 00:01:00,434
if you work
together.

19
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,133
Here.

20
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:03,966
Charles, go into
your sister's room

21
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,533
and get some of
her art supplies.

22
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:07,100
Go on.

23
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,166
Ellie, you're gonna help him.

24
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,766
I know it's hard, El,

25
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:13,733
but your-your brother...

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,366
does have a knack for getting

27
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,066
into trouble.

28
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,567
But you...

29
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:21,534
You're gonna have
to protect Chuck.

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,334
Be there for him
no matter what

31
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,934
'cause you're
his big sister.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Can you do that for me?

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,934
Devon, I lost them.
I lost the truck!

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,967
Call me as soon
as you can see them, okay?

35
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,134
Chuck, where are you?

36
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:55,967
Chuck, I know
how much you're hurting,

37
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,067
but you have to know
that there is nothing

38
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,533
that you could
have done, okay?

39
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,568
It's not your fault.

40
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,568
Yes, it is.

41
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,834
I'm the one who downloaded
the Intersect 2.0.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,201
I'm the one
who chose to be a spy,

43
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,234
and it's him who paid the price.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
So who's gonna get us out
of this one?

45
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:21,334
Who even knows we're here?

46
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:27,799
Okay, babe.
We found him.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,133
Devon, these people killed
my father.

48
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:30,933
They're gonna do the same thing
to Chuck.

49
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:32,533
You have to stop them, okay?

50
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:34,400
I know. I know.

51
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,133
We're on it.

52
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:37,366
What are we gonna do?

53
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,500
We don't have a plan.

54
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:39,833
No plan?

55
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,734
Never stopped me before.

56
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,867
Everybody good? Comfy?

57
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,468
Uncuff yourselves.

58
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,866
It should look like

59
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,400
you were trying to escape
when I kill you.

60
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:07,167
<i>Gee, Morgan,</i>

61
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:09,767
I think that when one is facing
a group of murderers,

62
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,266
one should have a plan.

63
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:12,833
Okay, I agree with you

64
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,233
in principle, but we're
here now, all right?

65
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:16,234
What would you like me to do,
open up the glove box?

66
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:17,533
Pull up the spy manual?
Maybe just...?

67
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:19,468
This is Casey's car.

68
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,434
Glove box.
Glove box.

69
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:25,367
Whoa.

70
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:26,666
Get to it.

71
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,933
Don't look at me.
I'm a doctor.

72
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,333
I can't use this.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

73
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,200
Easy, will you?

74
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,732
I'm a lapsed
vegetarian. I...

75
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,933
Here...

76
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:36,201
Here's a button.

77
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,966
Whoa.

78
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,467
What did you just do?

79
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,100
I hit... I hit a button...

80
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,833
Yeah, well, un... unhit it.
What's wrong with you? Hey! Hey!

81
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,333
You just push any button
you see? You're like...

82
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:45,533
How many missions
have you been on?

83
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:47,434
How many missions
have you been...?

84
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,334
Chuck?

85
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,632
Are you okay?

86
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,500
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

87
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,401
Everyone okay?

88
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:10,967
We're here to save you.

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Hey, you used my missile.

90
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,133
Pretty cool, huh?

91
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:34,034
Yell at me later.
Let's go.

92
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,500
Chuck. Come on.
Get in the car.

93
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,867
Come on.
Get in the car.

94
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,667
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Move it!

95
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,000
<i>You're gonna have
to protect Chuck.</i>

96
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,967
Be there for him
no matter what,

97
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:41,034
'cause you're
his big sister.

98
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:43,800
Can you do that for me?

99
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,600
Yeah.

100
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,568
<i>Okay, Dad, I promise.</i>

101

Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

102
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:57,899
Look, by now, Shaw's alerted
the Ring of our escape.

103
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,000
They'll be looking
for us.

104
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,266
What do we do now?

105
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,699
If there's one thing
I learned from my dad,

106
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,133
it's that we have to be smart.

107
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:05,201
We have to do what he would
have done. We need to disappear.

108
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,933
Yeah. Give up
our old lives.

109
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,400
Drop off
the grid.

110
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,301
Okay, so we're in agreement
then. That's the plan.

111
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,236
Wait. I'm sorry.
That's the plan?

112
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,499
We give up our lives?

113
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,966
Babe, it's the best
for all of us.

114
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,400
Devon, what are you
talking about?

115
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,566
This is not us.

116
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,800
We don't live
off grids, okay?

117
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,934
We are regular people.
We live on planet Earth,

118
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,901
and my father was murdered
today.

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,434
Our father, Chuck.

120
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,233
I'm calling the police.
It's what regular people do.

121
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,567
No. Hey, no calls.

122
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:35,632
They'll track 'em.

123
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:36,632
This is insane.

124
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:37,833
I'm going.

125
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,734
Sis, wait!

126
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,532
Get out of the car, Chuck!

127
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:44,866
Can we talk about this
for a second?

128
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,066
What's happening?

129
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,034
Is my husband safe
with you?

130
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:51,034
Um... yeah. Why?

131
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:53,334
Because Chuck
and I need to talk.

132
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,532
Hmm. Two Bartowskis.

133
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,433
Double the fun.

134
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:04,700
Hello, egg white omelet
on English muffin

135
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,667
with my favorite
banana peppers to boot.

136
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:10,468
160 calories of deliciousness.

137
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,767
I do know how
to build a better breakfast.

138
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,368
Mmm!

139
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Talk to me, Moses.

140
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,767
Anyone seen Morgan?

141
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:37,766
Chuck around?

142
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,100
Tell me John's in the john.

143
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,100
Can we help you, sir?

144
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,367
I need my assistant managers

145
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,566
and Chuck.

146
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,100
Hey, what we lack profoundly

147
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:46,267
and proudly
in on-the-job competence,

148
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:49,034
we more than make up for
with listening skills.

149
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,301
Actually, I'm deaf
in my left ear,

150
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,066
except for a faint ringing.

151
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,967
Psst.

152
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,233
It's big news, boys.

153
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:58,467
The store's numbers are down.

154
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,066
Mm. My main man Moses,

155
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,967
founder of the Buy More
himself, called.

156
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:04,018
Said if we don't see
a spike in numbers

157
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:06,034
and fast, they're gonna
close the store.

158
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,001
What?! Factoring Jeffrey out

159
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,499
of the conversation
for a minute,

160
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,966
may I propose something

161
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,900
that I rarely do
in life myself?

162
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,101
Tell... the... truth.

163
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,400
What you talking about, Lester?

164
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,700
Well, if in fact, we are
going out of business,

165
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,101
why not just tell that to
our most loyal customers?

166
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,867
You mean have
a going out of business sale.

167
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,532
Slash the prices.

168
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,533
Sell everything
to juice the books.

169
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,799
That's crazy!

170
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,468
Crazy...

171
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,166
good?

172
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,900
There may be a brain
under that mop after all.

173
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,633
Hello.

174
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,067
The phone did not
ring, Jeffrey.

175
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:50,734
Stupid left ear.

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,434
I don't understand how
you can know all this,

177
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,468
how you can have
all these secrets...

178
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,533
...and I'm the last
person to know.

179
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:03,101
I thought that I knew you
better than anyone.

180
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,167
Not telling you was the best way
to keep you safe.

181
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,468
Believe me, there's no one
I wanted to tell more.

182
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,633
I mean, you raised me, you know?

183
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,600
Do you remember
when I broke Mom's necklace,

184
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,267
and she left a couple days
later, and I thought,

185
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,666
that's-that's why
she disappeared?

186
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,233
That it was my fault?

187
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:24,667
I hated her for leaving.

188
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,967
For making you feel that way.

189
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,834
And the way you were with Dad.

190
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,532
No 12-year-old should
ever have to worry

191
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,433
about handling
the family's bank account.

192
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,834
I can't believe
that he's gone.

193
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,899
Our crazy dad.

194
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,301
He wasn't crazy.

195
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,600
Our dad was a hero.

196
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,134
He was a great man

197
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:56,667
who did amazing things.

198
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:59,067
He was not perfect-
not as a dad, no-

199
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,034
but he was great.

200
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,967
That's the secret
I most wanted you to know.

201
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:23,468
What are we gonna do?

202
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,066
We're gonna go after 'em,
and we're gonna get 'em.

203
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,233
We're gonna take 'em down-

204
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,234
the Ring and Shaw-
for what they did to Dad.

205
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:31,001
They are not gonna
get away with this.

206
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,967
Okay.

207
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,799
And then you're done.

208
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,400
What?

209
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:40,401
As a spy, this-this life,
this job.

210
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:42,333
Chuck, I made a promise
to protect you,

211
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,533
and I can't do it,
not from this.

212
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,934
So you finish it,

213
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,101
and then you're done.

214
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,766
Ellie, I can't...

215
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,134
We are all that we
have left, Chuck.

216
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,368
And I'm not gonna lose you, too.

217
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,401
Okay.

218
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:06,401
I'll get Shaw and I quit.

219
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:08,434
I promise.

220
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:13,533
All right,
so Devon's in the car.

221
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:14,833
Sarah's making sure
it's not bugged.

222
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,466
You remember the plan, right?
You leave the city-

223
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,167
don't tell me where-
I don't want to know.

224
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,399
Use only cash
and pay phones,

225
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,866
and I will call you
when it's safe.

226
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,299
You got that?
I got it, okay.

227
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,299
Uh, what
about Morgan?

228
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,533
Should I take
him with me?

229
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,000
Funny thing about Morgan-

230
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:28,300
he's, he's actually
a part of my spy team.

231
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,667
He's helping
Casey's daughter go off-grid.

232
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:31,900
Casey has a daughter?

233
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:32,966
I know it's a lot
to process,

234
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,067
but there's not enough time
right now.

235
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,933
You have to go.

236
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,834
Stay safe.

237
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,001
Don't forget about your promise.

238
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:43,267
I won't.

239
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,867
Time to take down the Ring.

240
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:57,299
Perimeter is set.

241
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,299
What are you doing?

242
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,633
Well, when Shaw grabbed me,
I noticed

243
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:00,833
that the holding cells
were equipped

244
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,399
for remote interrogation,

245
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,567
so if I can crack
into their system, I can...

246
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:07,200
Wait... There,

247
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:09,567
there, right there,
there she is.

248
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:10,966
It's Beckman.

249
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,332
I'm going to open a channel.

250
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,332
General.

251
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,766
General!

252
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,332
Who's there?

253
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,332
Is that you, Shaw?

254
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,533
No, General, this is Chuck.

255
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:21,734
Chuck, thank God.

256
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:22,800
Where are you?

257
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,033
What are you doing?

258
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,499
We're gonna take down Shaw
and the Ring,

259
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
but we honestly have no idea
how to do it.

260
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,100
Listen fast.

261
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:32,801
I came to Los Angeles
for the Joint Security Summit.

262
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,901
It's a public conference
of security experts,

263
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,134
but it's really
a secret meeting of spies.

264
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,833
Shaw's plan was to discredit me

265
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,633
and take my place
at the conference.

266
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,233
Coup d'état. The Ring is
taking over the CIA and the NSA.

267
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,901
So if we had a plan,
that plan would be...

268
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,834
The conference is happening
tonight at the Grand Ambassador.

269
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,199
Wait, General, wait.

270
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,199
Damn it.

271
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,966
Chuck, Chuck,

272
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:56,867
the five elders will be there.

273
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,300
Hey, a-are you okay?

274
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,332
Yeah.

275
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,666
Yeah, sorry, yeah,

276
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,701
just a, a lot of data.

277
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,533
Listen, who are the elders?

278
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:17,134
<i>They sound scary,
like World of Warcraft scary.</i>

279
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,068
The elders, Morgan,
are the leaders of the Ring.

280
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,366
Makes sense.

281
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,500
Ring operatives were hidden
in all the major agencies.

282
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,933
All right, that's it:
we break into the convention;

283
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,733
we expose Shaw;
and we capture the elders.

284
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,033
Conference will be surrounded
by an army

285
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,100
of security agents

286
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,167
and filled

287
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:31,266
with spies.

288
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,433
Suicide mission.
The only ones

289
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:33,800
who could pull it off
would have to be

290
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,000
the best spies in the world.

291
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,901
Chuck, you're embarrassing me.

292
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,866
We can do it.

293
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,332
Yeah, well, we'd better.
It's Shaw.

294
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,267
We don't have a choice.

295
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,833
Yeah, let's go get some payback.

296
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,033
Payback-
that's what I was gonna say.

297
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,033
Definitely
get-some-payback time.

298
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,533
<i>Okay, Chuck,</i>

299
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:50,733
<i>we're going in undercover</i>

300
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,934
<i>as members
of the Russian delegation.</i>

301
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,499
<i>This means we need disguises.</i>

302
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,033
<i>Think you can handle that?</i>

303
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,200
<i>Sarah, I was Perchik
in Fiddler.</i>

304
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:00,167
<i>It's true. He was great.</i>

305
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,100
<i>Thanks, buddy.</i>

306
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,601
It's him- Shaw.

307
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:15,733
Excuse me.

308
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,232
And once
we I.D. Shaw,

309
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,666
Casey, you, and Morgan
will take over.

310
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,567
Okay, we're in the server room.

311
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:22,966
Why'd I get Morgan for this job?

312
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,134
Hey, hey,
I'm right here, please.

313
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,533
Just call me after
you've cracked

314
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,133
into the conference's
database.

315
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,133
Okay, this is great.

316
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,366
That's the conduit right there,

317
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,734
so I just need a hand
getting up there.

318
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,833
Boost.

319
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,633
You ready?

320
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:39,199
I was born rea...
well, no, actually,

321
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,534
no, I wasn't born ready,
but I am ready now.

322
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,934
<i>Now, remember, Chuck,</i>

323
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:46,199
<i>in order for this plan to work,</i>

324
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,433
<i>you'll need
to fully convince Shaw.</i>

325
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:49,334
<i>Make eye contact,
shake his hand,</i>

326
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,367
<i>and act
as if you were strangers.</i>

327
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,367
Excuse me.

328
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,334
Uh, I don't believe
we've met.

329
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,733
Daniel Shaw.

330
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,800
Ah, yes.

331
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,800
Yuri Sheshenko.

332
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,299
It is
a great pleasure

333
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,766
to meet you,
Mr. Shaw.

334
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,667
Well, thank you.

335
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,133
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

336
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:13,034
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

337
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,800
Good job.

338
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:24,300
Yeah, well, you can thank my
very convincing facial hair.

339
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,267
Come on.

340
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,800
Okay, good, good, Chuck.

341
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:31,800
Number 752.

342
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:34,134
Hear that? 752.

343
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,199
One second, hold on.

344
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,199
Okay.

345
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,199
Let me get this thing off.

346
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,100
Hold on one second.

347
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,734
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

348
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:45,267
Hey, little help.

349
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,300
What is this?

350
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,200
Why do you have
my daughter's phone number?

351
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,767
Hmm.

352
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,934
Hi, Chuck.

353
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,833
Shaw says your accent
could use a little work.

354
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,000
Justin, right?

355
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,901
You're the one
who manipulated my sister.

356
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,399
That's right.

357
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,434
Yeah, well, I think this is
going to hurt a little bit.

358
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,499
Chuck? Chuck?

359
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,800
Are you okay?

360
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,000
Sarah.

361
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:30,367
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to tell you.

362
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,434
Can you please just tell me
what's really going on?

363
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,400
The Intersect-
the flashes are getting worse.

364
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,266
Okay, we have to
abort the mission.

365
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,466
Shaw is not worth this.

366
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,466
No, if I get
the Governor

367
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,566
back from Shaw,
then I'll be fine,

368
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,933
but the plan is
only gonna work

369
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,800
if you help Morgan and Casey.
I can't leave you like this.

370
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:46,499
I'm okay, really.

371
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,599
You have to go.

372
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,901
We have to stop him.

373
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,667
You're not going
to believe it.

374
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:08,134
There's a line around the store
of stay-at-home moms

375
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,033
ready for the sale tomorrow.

376
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,934
Yes.

377
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,666
Um, Big Mike,

378
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,067
we, uh- Jefferson and myself
were hoping to...

379
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:20,034
screen this tomorrow.

380
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,933
You know, since you're
our manager and all,

381
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:24,500
we thought it'd be a good idea.
What is it?

382
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:25,800
Our music video.

383
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,000
We spent two weekends on it.

384
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,833
Two weekends.

385
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,867
Great idea.

386
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,834
But let's do it late in the day.

387
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,734
Wouldn't want to scare anyone
away too early.

388
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:39,533
<i>The CIA believes
that international terrorism</i>

389
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:40,900
<i>is a growth industry.</i>

390
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:44,400
The demand for the security
we offer is even greater

391
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:48,134
than it was a year ago, which
brings me to my next point.

392
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,567
Excuse me.

393
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:03,567
Did you know the Nerd Herd
offers a wide variety

394
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:06,467
of helpful hints for making your
business presentations better?

395
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:08,901
Chuck, where are you?

396
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,101
I'm in room 752,
which I believe is your room.

397
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:15,567
Also, we are well aware that
your bosses- the Ring elders-

398
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:17,432
are in the audience right now...

399
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:21,067
...and they have got
to be asking themselves,

400
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,300
"Who is Daniel talking to?"

401
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,967
Ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:34,299
please remain seated.

403
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,001
The presentation
will begin again shortly.

404
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,201
<i>Casey, Morgan,
Shaw's left the stage.</i>

405
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,733
Tell me everything.

406
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,499
Why do you have
my daughter's phone number?

407
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,666
Hold on a second.

408
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,567
Alex gave that to me
on her own free will.

409
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,833
But as friends.

410
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,066
Friends?
Yeah.

411
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,800
Or something more?

412
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:53,767
Your heart's racing; pupils
dilated; skin's flushed.

413
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,066
You like her.

414
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,333
Or you're choking me.

415
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,733
Hey.

416
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:00,699
Sarah.

417
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,233
Oh, just in time.

418
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:04,134
What for?
Come on. Let's go.

419
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,567
Here.

420
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,066
It's not a toy,
Morgan.

421
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,933
Ready?
Yeah.

422
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,967
This discussion
is not over.

423
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,934
Muzzle down.
Yeah, muzzle down.

424
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,167
No gun.

425
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,034
Very brave, Chuck.

426
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,299
So what's happening?

427
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,566
You're under arrest.

428
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,299
No, what are
you doing here?

429
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,566
What's your plan?

430
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:38,966
I'm sorry.
Are you asking me

431
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,367
to make
the classic villain mistake

432
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:44,534
of explaining
my dastardly plot to you?

433
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,233
You know what?
I'd love to.

434
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,168
I confess

435
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,901
we had no idea who the elders
were or how to I.D. them,

436
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,867
so we let you do that for us

437
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:55,366
when you warned them
to leave the theater,

438
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,333
so on behalf
of the NSA,

439
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,300
the CIA, and of course
your local Buy More,

440
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,300
I'd just like to say
thanks a lot.

441
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,801
Hey.

442
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:08,533
Going somewhere?

443
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,667
Reach for the
sky, dirtbags.

444
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,967
Oh, you people are the disease
and I'm the cure.

445
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:15,967
Back off there, Cobra.
I didn't give you any bullets.

446
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,133
Are you kidding me?

447
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,034
I knew this thing
felt too light.

448
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:21,934
Chuck, we've got 'em.

449
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,566
I'm on my way up to you.

450
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,467
Do not give Shaw an inch.

451
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,167
Done.

452
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:28,332
Ring captured.

453
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,734
It's another check
on my to-do list.

454
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,701
Do you see what you did wrong?

455
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,433
You and your team
are fugitives.

456
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,901
On whose authority
would anyone arrest me?

457
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,934
What about my father?

458
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:45,168
Yes, I killed your father.

459
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:47,134
Yes, I work
for the Ring.

460
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:48,900
I'm going to take down
the CIA, Chuck,

461
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:52,367
and still I'm going to walk
out of here a hero.

462
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,333
How does that make you feel?

463
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,700
You know, your Nerd Herd
associate can also help you

464
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,500
with videoconferencing.

465
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:13,801
Smile, Daniel.

466
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:16,168
You're on TV.

467
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,001
What do I say
to that?

468
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,700
Mwah-ha-ha.

469
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:33,434
Now...

470
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,367
Give me the Governor.

471
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:39,599
Don't make me take it from you.

472
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,700
I'd like to see you try.

473
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:55,034
I knew you didn't
have it in you.

474
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:04,168
So clever, so smart.

475
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,666
There's no way out
of this one.

476
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,466
Shaw!

477
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,367
Drop him!

478
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:28,434
Chuck?

479
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:31,001
Hey.

480
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,400
Help me.

481
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,167
Going out of business?
What the...

482
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,767
...hell is going on here?

483
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:48,701
I've only been gone
for two days.

484
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,199
These numbers
are amazing.

485
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,401
Boys... you know
what time it is.

486
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,466
Please.

487
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,466
Say "Jeffster time."

488
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:56,367
Say it. Say it.

489
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:01,668
What the hell
is going on here?

490
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,500
Who authorized this sale?

491
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:04,633
This store is supposed
to be closed.

492
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,899
These people are
stealing from us.

493
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,300
You guys, you guys,

494
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,733
this is not good.

495
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,334
Old man Moses couldn't
protect us anymore.

496
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,567
They up and closed
the store.

497
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:14,899
All of this merchandise

498
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,099
was supposed to be shipped
to Beverly Hills.

499
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,566
Where is Mike?!

500
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,467
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

501
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,100
Hey.

502
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,566
Where is everyone?

503
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,166
Casey's gone to get Ellie
and Awesome,

504
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,832
and Morgan's checking in
to the Buy More.

505
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,534
I promised her I'd leave.

506
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,534
That I wouldn't be
a spy anymore.

507
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:39,899
What?

508
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,833
Ellie.

509
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,301
She's going to be so mad at me
if I die.

510
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,199
Hey, we're going to get
that Governor, okay?

511
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,033
I'm going to find Shaw
and I'm going to get it back,

512
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,934
no matter where he is.

513
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,733
Hello?

514
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:38,701
This isn't about you.

515
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,900
Shaw.

516
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:41,966
I'm in the store.

517
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,867
I've wired it with explosives.

518
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,367
It'll take ten minutes for
the CIA backup team to arrive.

519
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:49,334
I only need seconds.

520
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:52,166
I want you to send me Chuck.

521
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,167
Now.

522
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:57,700
Okay.

523
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:00,067
We're on our way.

524
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,300
<i>Help!</i>

525
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:14,367
Help me! Anybody?

526
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:19,234
Come on.

527
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:22,034
Come... oh, no.

528
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:46,867
What the hell's going on,
Morgan?

529
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,633
Walker just pulled
the silent alarm.

530
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:49,899
Yeah, it's-it's Shaw, okay.

531
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,433
He's here and he planted
bombs all over the store

532
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:53,401
<i>and he's going to blow
the whole place up.</i>

533
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,401
Where's Chuck?

534
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,366
<i>You got to get everyone
out of the store.</i>

535
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,700
You anywhere near a fire alarm?

536
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:03,999
Yes. It's outside the cage.

537
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,733
But I'm-I'm-I'm tied up
inside the cage.

538
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:07,600
My hands are cuffed to a chair.

539
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,033
You got to break your thumbs,
Morgan.

540
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,634
I'm sorry.
Can you say that again?

541
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:13,033
Your thumbs.

542
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:15,000
To get free,
you got to break 'em.

543
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:16,333
Now! Do it!

544
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:18,267
Break your thumbs.

545
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:20,933
Yes, sir.

546
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,701
You don't want to kill
all these people.

547
00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:35,033
You're right.

548
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:36,767
I don't want to kill
all these people.

549
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:39,367
However, I would like
to kill Chuck.

550
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,668
And I wouldn't mind
killing you, too.

551
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:47,601
Hey, have you seen Big Mike?

552
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:49,400
We're going to need a diversion
to get out of here.

553
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,467
What are you thinking?

554
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:53,434
Pineapple.

555
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:08,600
Go, go, go.

556
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:11,067
Well done, Jeff.
Let's go.

557
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,034
<i>Shaw, stop it!
You don't understand.</i>

558
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:38,466
Where is he?

559
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,966
He's not coming.

560
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,933
He can't.

561
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,267
A gunfight?

562
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:08,267
Is that what you really want?

563
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:10,301
Do you have one good flash left?

564
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:16,634
Saved the best for last.

565
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:39,601
* *

566
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:49,534
I'm waiting, Chuck.

567
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,933
* *

568
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:31,967
* *

569
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,900
Please, stop it, Shaw!

570
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:53,134
Chuck?

571
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:55,934
Chuck, please.
Chuck, please wake up.

572
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:06,166
Hey, Dad...

573
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,134
Charles, I'll be back
in a second.

574
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:57,534
Chuck?

575
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,534
Chuck, you all right?

576
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,099
Are you all right?
Did you...?

577
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,000
Did you...?

578
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,799
Was a complete transfer.

579
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,700
Empty files.

580
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:15,734
The whole system went
into you. You...

581
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,900
processed an incredible
amount of data.

582
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,434
But you're okay.

583
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:24,534
What does that mean?

584
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,199
Hang on. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

585
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,167
You're going to be okay.

586
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,167
You're special, son.

587
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:34,334
It means you're special.

588
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:36,334
<i>You're special.</i>

589
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,167
<i>You're special, son.</i>

590
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:40,799
It means you're special.

591
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,100
Please, Chuck,
come on.

592
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,100
Shaw, stop it!

593
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,067
Chuck?

594
00:31:57,768 --> 00:31:59,400
Chuck.

595
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,634
Sorry.

596
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,634
Just had to reboot.

597
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:46,668
You have to do it.

598
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:50,668
You have to kill me.

599
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:56,534
No, thanks.

600
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:58,933
I've already done that
once before.

601
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:03,301
That's what makes you weak.

602
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,367
No. That's what makes you great.

603
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:21,200
Your dad wanted you
to have this.

604
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,967
This is not good.

605
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:06,134
I am definitely going
to be fired tomorrow.

606
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,967
Big Mike, sir,

607
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:15,401
what if I told you
there was another way?

608
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,333
A way we could
save our jobs,

609
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:18,699
be heroes...?

610
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,832
Do tell, Barnes.

611
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,400
Do tell.

612
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:23,200
We burn the Buy More.

613
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:25,668
Burn it down to the ground.

614
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,233
Burn down what?!

615
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,134
It would be my honor
to do that for you.

616
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,433
That's it.

617
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:32,634
I have had it with you two!

618
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,833
You have brought me nothing
but pain and misery.

619
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,167
You answering phones
that ain't ringing.

620
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:40,767
And you- your singing voice
is a vocal felony.

621
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,934
With that, good night,
good riddance,

622
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:47,034
and good-bye!

623
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:51,234
So none of these firemen
are real, huh?

624
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:52,966
CIA cleaners looking
for Shaw's detonator.

625
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,600
By the way,
good work today.

626
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,568
Takes something special
to break your thumbs.

627
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:58,466
Come on. It's nothing.
They're just thumbs.

628
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,133
What any good partner
would do. Yeah.

629
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:02,201
Will you tell Beckman of
my exploits? It depends.

630
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,167
Why do you have my
daughter's phone number?

631
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:06,167
Oh.

632
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:09,833
Aah. Aah. Aah.

633
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,601
Oh.

634
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:14,568
Sarah, I told Ellie that I'd
quit after we stop the Ring,

635
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:18,733
and I meant it.

636
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,700
I can't lie to her.

637
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,733
You think you could
love a regular guy?

638
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,301
Well, I fell in love
with a regular guy.

639
00:35:30,034 --> 00:35:32,367
Hey!

640
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:34,166
Found the detonator.

641
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,400
Found the
detonator, Colonel.

642
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,900
Am I on some hero
streak or what?

643
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,900
Man, when you're hot, you're
hot. Careful with that, Grimes.

644
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:42,134
Now will you tell Beckman
of my exploits?

645
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:44,033
Okay? How I broke
my thumbs and how

646
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:45,732
I found the detonator.
He's gonna drop it.

647
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:47,633
And how I...
dropped it.

648
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:50,800
I can't believe
I just did that.

649
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,033
Bombs are armed, everybody!

650
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:54,166
Run!

651
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,567
I'm-I'm so sorry, everybody.

652
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:57,468
I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.

653
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,699
Everybody, get back! Get back!

654
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,600
Get back!
Hit the deck!

655
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:15,467
Did we do that?

656
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:17,534
I don't know.

657
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,733
Start the van.
All clear!

658
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,167
Everyone please exit
the area in a calm

659
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:24,134
and orderly fashion.

660
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,033
Sweet lord, they did it.

661
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:38,832
They actually did it.

662
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,134
Those crazy nerds
blew up the freakin' Buy More.

663
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,832
<i>In our top story</i>

664
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,500
tonight, it's been 24 hours

665
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,800
since the Burbank Buy More
burned to the ground,

666
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:48,833
and the police have had no luck

667
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,167
in apprehending
the two lead suspects.

668
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:53,099
<i>These two men are on the run</i>

669
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,601
<i>and considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

670
00:36:55,668 --> 00:36:57,400
If you encounter
these fugitives,

671
00:36:57,401 --> 00:37:00,067
please call your
local authorities immediately.

672
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,034
And in other...

673
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,033
Thanks, buddy.

674
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:05,533
Of course.

675
00:37:05,534 --> 00:37:07,568
Um...

676
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:10,733
We didn't always think
he was the greatest family man,

677
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,600
but we know

678
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:15,833
that there was nothing more
important to him than family.

679
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:22,301
To a great man,

680
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,267
Stephen J. Bartowski.

681
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,934
To Dad.

682
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,234
Mm.

683
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,300
Hi.
Hi.

684
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:48,201
I hope I didn't miss dinner.

685
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:50,401
No. No. come in,
please. Welcome to

686
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,467
La Casa de Bartowski.

687
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:54,166
Uh, Alex,
this is my sister Ellie.

688
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:55,300
Hi.

689
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:56,500
And that's Devon,

690
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,501
her-her husband
back there.

691
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,501
Just so glad you came.

692
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:05,300
Me, too.

693
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:06,567
Oh.

694
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:08,468
Okay.

695
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,633
Well,

696
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:16,966
he's not much
of a hugger,

697
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,200
but baby steps, right?

698
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:19,766
I'm glad to see you,

699
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:21,266
Alex. I, too,

700
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:22,866
am glad that you
came... Step aside.

701
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,100
Before I break the rest
of your fingers. Hmm?

702
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,067
Or you blow up
the apartment.

703
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,234
Oh, that's low, Casey.
Okay? It was an accident.

704
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,799
Chuck it was
an accident.

705
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,533
I couldn't grip anything.
I know. I know it was...

706
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:33,832
I know it was
an accident, buddy.

707
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:37,634
So... Chuck... are
you done for real?

708
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:44,167
Uh, I told Beckman
that I'm out.

709
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:47,401
I mean, after all, I did
get her her job back, and

710
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,434
simultaneously saved
multiple branches

711
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,601
of the United States government,
so she accepted.

712
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:54,067
I'm a civilian
just like you.

713
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:56,067
Really?

714
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,366
You were right, sis.

715
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,267
There's nothing more important
than family.

716
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:03,732
Love you.

717
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:05,867
I love you, too.

718
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:37,034
Oh, boy.

719
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,934
Hello, Chuck.

720
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,633
If you're seeing this,

721
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:52,634
that means I wasn't able to stop
this message from sending.

722
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,000
which also means I'm dead.

723
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:59,800
I want to say about that, um,

724
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,867
I- I'm sorry and-and...

725
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:07,201
Well, I hope you and your sister
know how much I love you.

726
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,401
Loved you.

727
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:15,467
Now I need you
to do something for me,

728
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:16,766
Charles.

729
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:17,933
Something secret.

730
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:19,834
You better get a pen.

731
00:40:22,434 --> 00:40:25,167
<i>I never wanted you
to be a spy.</i>

732
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:27,334
<i>I knew how dangerous
this world is,</i>

733
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:29,967
<i>what it does
to the people in it.</i>

734
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:32,767
<i>Boy, do I know that.</i>

735
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:36,601
<i>That's why I kept something
from you,</i>

736
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:40,000
<i>something about me,
about Orion.</i>

737
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,100
Charles, I'll be back
in a second.

738
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,067
Hey, Dad.

739
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:53,167
<i>I've been a spy
for the last 20 years,</i>

740
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,167
<i>working for myself,</i>

741
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:59,134
<i>doing things
governments are afraid to do.</i>

742
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:09,100
<i>Maybe being a spy is...</i>

743
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,234
<i>is in our blood,</i>

744
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:14,301
<i>and... maybe
I should have told you...</i>

745
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:16,334
<i>all of this long ago,</i>

746
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:18,601
<i>but</i>

747
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:20,601
<i>Chuck,</i>

748
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:23,833
<i>your story-
it's only just beginning.</i>

749
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,000
<i>It's time you know the truth
about my work</i>

750
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:32,767
<i>and about the people
who tried to destroy me</i>

751
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,633
<i>because if I'm gone,</i>

752
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:37,800
<i>then you're not safe
from them anymore,</i>

753
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:40,767
<i>and neither is Ellie.</i>

754
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,134
<i>These people-
they-they are...</i>

755
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:48,534
<i>They are ruthless
and cunning and...</i>

756
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,034
<i>Chuck, it's-it's time
you learned</i>

757
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,000
<i>about your family.</i>

758
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:00,833
<i>Because...</i>

759
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:05,334
<i>I did it all for her.</i>

760
00:42:07,301 --> 00:42:09,234
Yes.

761
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:11,767
MAN
We're going to have to move you.

762
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,833
Now.

763
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:17,900
Mom?

764
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:21,761
