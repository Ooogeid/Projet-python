1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,431
Hi, i am chuck.
Here are a few things

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:03,520
that you might need to know.

3
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:03,880
- Jill!

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,360
There's no scenario in which
you should be going to dinner

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,240
with the girl that dumped you,
broke your heart

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,007
and slept with
your best friend.

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,300
What about your
cover girlfriend?

8
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,380
Won't she be jealous?

9
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,300
Our relationship's a cover.

10
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,580
You know, there's nothing
to be jealous about.

11
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,380
Chuck this is my boss,
Guy LeFleur.

12
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,860
Hi. Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,500
MI-6 has reports that
he may have developed

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,380
a bioweapon which he plans
to sell to the highest bidder.

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,180
The assassin
Agent Walker shot

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,060
was a member of FULCRUM.

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
If Jill knows something,

18
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,460
they may make a play for her.

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,980
The sensor will be blind
for 20 seconds.

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,780
Welcome to the world
of international espionage.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,740
Very handy for picnics.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,540
I have to say, I still can't
wrap my head around

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,980
the idea of you as a spy.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,980
You never told me
how that happened.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,340
Uh... well...

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,060
You don't choose your
profession, Jill.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,460
The right job chooses you.

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,180
Still-- never
would've guessed it.

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,300
Well, how about you soak
up this romantic view.

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,260
Yeah, real romantic.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,780
What? This is
the Buy More roof.

32
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,940
You smell that?

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,660
You smell what you're
smelling right now?

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
That is rarefied air, that very
few people ever get to experience.

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,140
Not to mention
the fact

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,700
that there aren't a lot
of places I can go

37
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,380
that aren't under
constant surveillance.

38
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,420
The government finds me very...

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,340
...very valuable.

40
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,300
Well, I can't say
that I blame them.

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,820
You've got to be kidding me.

42
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,380
Wait, hold on.

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
Give me a break.

44
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,300
Are you kidding me?

45
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,661
I've got her here.
We're having some food.

46
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:16,000
Amateur.

47
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,780
Casey, is that necessary?

48
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,940
How much trouble can
he get into on a date?

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,020
It's Bartowski.

50
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,100
You're pretty nonchalant about
your supercomputer boyfriend

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,820
trying to browse someone
else's network.

52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,580
Well, I am just
his cover girlfriend.

53
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,060
...with your bank of monitors.

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,340
You get off on this,
don't you?

55
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,820
Chuck's entitled to a real one.

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,220
Major Casey, Agent Walker.

57
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,060
I have the intel
on your new mission.

58
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,540
But it's going to require some
unorthodox reconnaissance.

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,300
Turns out our deceased doctor,
Guy LeFleur,

60
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,660
obtained a list
of CIA code names

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,140
for the agents he worked with.

62
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,620
We have reason to believe
it's a list

63
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,740
of FULCRUM operatives.
This may be our only chance

64
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,060
to find the corrupt agents
within our ranks.

65
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,980
Great.
And where's the list now?

66
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,180
Intel thinks it's hidden

67
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,900
in Guy's hotel room
at the Waldron.

68
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
We have to get that list
before FULCRUM does.

69
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,980
You need to
take the Intersect in

70
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,220
off-the-record
and see if he can flash.

71
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,700
Perhaps Chuck can find out
where the list is hidden.

72
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,260
You want us to break into

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,620
a government-controlled
crime scene?

74
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,700
It's the FBI.
How hard can it be?

75
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,420
Bogie at 5:00.

76
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,860
I'll handle this.

77
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Really? A camera on the roof
because of what?

78
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,180
All the terrorist activity
on top of the Buy More?

79
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,140
Okay, Casey may have been
a little aggressive,

80
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,780
but we just received our new mission.
- Already?

81
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,260
Tomorrow we're going to break
into Guy LeFleur's hotel room.

82
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,780
We think he might have a list
of all the FULCRUM agents

83
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
that were blackmailing him.

84
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,900
Wow. Okay.

85
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,060
Can we talk about
this tomorrow?

86
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,460
Because I have Jill

87
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,660
waiting for me in the car.
Of course.

88
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,900
Okay, thanks.

89
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,740
Uh, Chuck...

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,540
is everything all right?

91
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,180
Yeah... yeah, I'm fine.
Why do you ask?

92
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,900
Or is this some spy thing?

93
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,420
Some psych evaluation
or something like that?

94
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,300
It's a friend thing.

95
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,060
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

96
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,940
Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.

97
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,900
Being with Jill,
is... is...

98
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,700
It's like having
my old life back, you know?

99
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,100
And not to bash
on our cover,

100
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,220
but I'd forgotten
what it's like to be

101
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,540
with someone who
knows the real me.

102
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Well, from everything
I've seen,

103
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,260
she seems like a great girl.

104
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,820
Well, if you could
see a little less.

105
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,300
Maybe ease up
on the whole

106
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,140
Chuck Bartowski
24-hour surveillance.

107
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,700
Yeah, I'll talk to Casey.

108
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,700
You deserve your
privacy, Chuck.

109
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,820
Thank you.

110
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,660
Okay.

111
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,620
So Sarah said there's going to be

112
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,060
an easing up
of the Chuck surveillance.

113
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,460
You're a government
asset, Chuck.

114
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,100
Sometimes your personal life
has to take a backseat.

115
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
We tried the backseat.

116
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,740
You have a camera
in the car, too.

117
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,260
Come on, how many...
how many second chances

118
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,900
do you get with
the one who got away?

119
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,860
Plus, she already knows
I'm a... you know.

120
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,220
I'm not even interested in
my own feelings, Bartowski.

121
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,580
Keep your mind
on the mission.

122
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,700
We leave in ten.

123
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,340
Hey, Chuck.
Morning.

124
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,060
Canada has just delivered

125
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,460
its most delightful gift
since Shania Twain.

126
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,820
Behold the Q-36 game copier.

127
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,900
Check it out-- now all we
have to do is rent a game,

128
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,380
rip it, and we never have to pay
for our entertainment again.

129
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,900
Yeah, Big Mike's going
to be thrilled

130
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
seeing as how we sell
video games.

131
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,540
Come on, dude,
this thing can ignore

132
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,860
all forms of copy protection.

133
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,340
It can copy anything.

134
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,140
Highly illegal.

135
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,220
What's illegal, gentlemen?

136
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,580
Oh. Going to smoke some weed
on your lunch break?

137
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,820
A little reefer?

138
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,820
Ganja?

139
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,700
I have heard the loading dock

140
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,180
is like
a Five for Fighting concert.

141
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,140
So fierce.

142
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,660
Chuck, can I see you

143
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,100
in my office, please?

144
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,220
Uh, sorry, Emmett, can't.

145
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,460
Got to go.

146
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,820
Oh, really? Where?

147
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,020
Uh... it's an off-site
install.

148
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,900
It's probably going
to take a while, so...

149
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,740
See ya.

150
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,420
You're going to a hotel
tonight with your cover girlfriend?

151
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,100
Well, uh, you know, I mean,
if it's any comfort...

152
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,220
overnight missions
normally involve Casey

153
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,620
and a whole lot
of firearms.

154
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,940
So, nothing romantic about it.

155
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,500
So what is this Sarah like?

156
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,260
Is she pretty?

157
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,140
Um, well... I could understand
how a typical heterosexual male

158
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,100
might find her aesthetically
pleasing, you know.

159
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,900
And if someone
were to ask me,

160
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,140
"Chuck, technically,
objectively,

161
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,500
do you find your CIA
handler Sarah attractive?"

162
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,740
Then I might say,
"Technically, objectively...

163
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,580
...Sure."

164
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,860
Uh-huh.

165
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,420
And all those
missions you go on,

166
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,580
it's not exciting
and romantic?

167
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,420
Look, you got it all wrong.

168
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,060
There is nothing
about this job

169
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,060
that's glamorous or sexy.

170
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,820
All right.

171
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,380
Hi-oh.

172
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,078
Was it absolutely necessary

173
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:04,598
for you to dress up
like a...?

174
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:06,518
An escort?
- Yeah, yeah, an escort.

175
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,238
And why exactly is Mr. Carmichael
paying you to have sex with me...

176
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:11,758
...him?
The Waldron is notorious

177
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:13,478
for its high-end businessmen
and their trysts.

178
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:14,598
It's our cover, so sell it.

179
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:19,398
Wonder how much
that costs?

180
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,838
I've got the security feed.

181
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,718
It looks like the FBI
has Guy's room on lockdown.

182
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,518
We won't be asking
permission before we slip in.

183
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:32,878
We'll just enter through
the ventilation system.

184
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:40,838
Hey, hey...

185
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,918
how long is this
going to take?

186
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,558
What's the matter,
Bartowski, you got a date?

187
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:46,598
Actually, yes.

188
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:47,718
Ow!
You okay?

189
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:48,678
Why don't you just call ahead

190
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:49,798
and let them know we're coming?

191
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:52,838
Sorry.
Idiot.

192
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:54,798
I'm just trying to figure out
what time I'm going to be home.

193
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:55,998
Well, just do
the cover math.

194
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,598
How long would it take
for a businessman

195
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,878
to have sex
with a prostitute?

196
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,598
Stupid phone.

197
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,038
Hello?

198
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:11,798
Sarah, you think
this shouldn't take us

199
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:14,238
more than an hour to have sex
from start to finish?

200
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:15,238
Uh-huh.

201
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:17,118
And...

202
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:18,878
begin.

203
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,758
What... what am I...

204
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:23,118
What am I doing wrong here?

205
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,438
Well, just move your hips
a little to the left.

206
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,118
Okay... okay.

207
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,198
This is way more exhausting
than I thought it would be.

208
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,718
Well, we can't
just race right through it.

209
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,918
Your knees aren't hurting?

210
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,478
What, did you go to a school
to learn how to do this?

211
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:48,118
Hey, how are you?

212
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:49,918
Hello, Emmett.

213
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,398
I was just coming in here
to get a snack.

214
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:54,598
Oh, you do not need a snack.
Please.

215
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,118
Okay.

216
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:03,358
Morgan, I want you
to imagine, for a moment,

217
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,078
that Buy More is a country.

218
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:07,038
Ah, BuyMoria.

219
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:08,838
Yes.

220
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:09,838
How did you know that?

221
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:11,398
I've thought about it for years.

222
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,478
This is fantastic.

223
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:16,998
Now, imagine that

224
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:18,918
all its employees

225
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,718
are the states that make up
this great nation.

226
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:22,718
Yeah, I can dig it.

227
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:25,438
And, if you will,
one of these states

228
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:27,518
is looking to secede
from the union.

229
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,558
Chuck.
Whoa.

230
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:31,878
Okay, wait a minute.

231
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:32,798
You're questioning
Chuck's patriotism

232
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:33,918
towards BuyMoria? No.

233
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,638
Where does he go
all the time?

234
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,078
I don't see receipts for all
the off-site installs he does.

235
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:40,038
What is he into, Morgan?

236
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:41,158
Uppers? Glue?

237
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:42,438
A baby mama?

238
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,918
Dude, you are out of your mind.

239
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:46,158
Maybe I am.

240
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,198
Maybe I'm so far out of my mind

241
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,758
that I've gotten myself
all crawled up inside of yours.

242
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,878
Let's see.

243
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,038
Oh.

244
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:57,758
This could be grounds
for deportation

245
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:59,398
from BuyMoria.

246
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,398
You wouldn't.

247
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,278
Help me, Morgan.

248
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,558
Help me help Chuck.

249
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:07,798
Chuck doesn't need our help.

250
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:11,638
Don't matter what she said.

251
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:12,958
Afternoon guard
duty is boring.

252
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:16,918
Here.

253
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:19,038
What are you doing up there?

254
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,278
Help!

255
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,078
Shh! It's the FBI.

256
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:23,958
They're dumb,
not deaf.

257
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:24,918
Thanks.

258
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:01,398
Sorry.

259
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:27,038
Hey. Hey.

260
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:35,838
And then she
shoves him in the pool.

261
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,478
I swear, if it wasn't
for the Xanax,

262
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:38,798
she would have
ripped his...

263
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,238
Hey, man.

264
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,558
I didn't expect
to see you today.

265
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,358
Well, never a day off
when you need it.

266
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:57,558
Ow!

267
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,118
Shh! Shh! Shh!

268
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:13,838
Does the word "silent" have
a different meaning in geek

269
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,158
that I'm not aware of?
- Look, I'm sorry.

270
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:16,158
I thought it was on vibrate.

271
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:17,838
At least I got the list.

272
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:20,398
It's a Venetian Puzzle Box.

273
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:22,198
Very popular with
Renaissance spies.

274
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:24,638
It's locked.

275
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:26,078
Hey-- beh, beh, beh.

276
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:27,678
The running, jumping, shooting
people part of the job,

277
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:28,638
that's all you guys.

278
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:30,238
But the puzzles, that's all me.

279
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:31,998
I think it would be

280
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,238
numerals one through
12 in a row.

281
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:35,398
But these boxes used

282
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:37,558
a complicated
Fibonacci sequence.

283
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,558
Let's see what we got.

284
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,838
Oh, Casey, gas!

285
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,838
Be right back with a containment unit.
- Well, is it off?!

286
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:00,398
Get it off me!
Take your clothes off!

287
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,838
Get in the shower now, quick!
Off! Get it off!

288
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:03,918
Pants off, come on!
I'm trying!

289
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:05,078
Hurry up!

290
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:06,438
Get in, get
in, get in.

291
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,238
Oh, cold! So-so-so cold!

292
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:09,278
Use the soap!

293
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:10,278
Wash it!
Oh! Oh!

294
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:11,758
Get the--
Oh, sorry, sorry!

295
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:13,358
I'm trying to--
I'm not trying to...!

296
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,318
Wash your face properly.

297
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:16,558
Tastes like soap!
Tastes like soap!

298
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:17,518
In your hair.

299
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:20,758
Oh! Oh, God.

300
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:36,998
Get the door. That's Casey.

301
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:38,718
We have no time
to waste; quick.

302
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:42,358
Jill.

303
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:43,958
Chuck.
How'd you...

304
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:46,558
The bellman sent me
to your room.

305
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,478
I knew it.

306
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:57,998
Jill, wait!

307
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:59,278
Wait, wait! It's
not what you think!

308
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,478
Jill, please!

309
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:01,598
I could be dying!

310
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,654
How long... how long
does this thing take?

311
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,854
How-how does Jill pick that
exact moment to walk in on us?

312
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,614
I mean, what-what-
what are the odds?

313
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:15,214
Does-does this, does this
give us the antidote?

314
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,894
Because I think
I feel my throat

315
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,494
is closing up on me right now.

316
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:21,974
What is it?

317
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:22,974
What is it,
flesh-eating bacteria

318
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:23,974
or anthrax?

319
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:25,254
Am I gonna die?

320
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:26,734
Nope.
But you can add ice

321
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:28,814
and give it to little kids
to sell on street corners.

322
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,054
I knew it.

323
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,694
Drugs.

324
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:35,054
It's powdered fruit punch,
dumb ass.

325
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,894
Wait...

326
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:38,614
So not only

327
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,334
did we not get
the FULCRUM list,

328
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:42,694
but Jill's never gonna speak to
me again because she caught me

329
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,654
naked, rinsing off fruit punch
with another woman?

330
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,414
Common spy problem.

331
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:49,254
Really?

332
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:52,574
I don't know what to tell you.

333
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:53,614
I don't know anything.

334
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,534
Oh, of course you do, Lester.

335
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:57,614
You've worked
very closely with Charles

336
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:59,014
for years.

337
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:01,174
Perhaps I've overstated
the nature of our relationship.

338
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,734
We don't socialize much.

339
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:04,854
In fact, I've felt slighted
on more than one occasion.

340
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,214
Oh, good.

341
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:08,334
Then you won't have a problem
ratting him out.

342
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:10,294
I have no ethical dilemma.

343
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:11,614
I meant I just don't
know anything!

344
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:12,774
Then who does?!

345
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,214
Jeff!
I would ask Jeff.

346
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:15,334
I don't rat.

347
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:16,454
Only thing
my mother

348
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:17,654
taught me from
the joint.

349
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:20,574
You want answers,
talk to the Injun.

350
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,094
"Injun" is a highly
derogatory term

351
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:24,174
referring to
Native Americans,

352
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:25,494
not East Indians,
you cretin!

353
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,254
Grab a shiv and make your move.

354
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:28,806
We should run now.
He's in "prison mode."

355
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:29,094
Shut up.

356
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:31,134
I guess I haven't
made myself clear.

357
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:34,454
You both host an
unsanctioned card game

358
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:35,574
in this break room.

359
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,974
You give me something
on Bartowski

360
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:39,774
or no more poker night.

361
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,054
Chuck's cheating on his lady.

362
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,134
Yeah, we saw him and
this brunette bird

363
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,614
leaving some fancy,
real-silverware joint

364
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:48,774
a couple of
nights ago.

365
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:50,894
She's not as well-endowed
as I would like.

366
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:51,894
Come on.

367
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:53,134
What's her name?

368
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:54,094
Who is she?

369
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,934
No more poker

370
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:01,934
No...
Morgan!

371
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:03,214
You got to break Morgan.

372
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:04,254
Chuck tells him everything.

373
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,654
His beard holds so many secrets.

374
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,134
Morgan.

375
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:10,014
Hey, Jill.

376
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:11,974
It's-It's me again-- Chuck.

377
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:13,134
Lucky message number four.

378
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:14,574
Listen, I just wanted to say,

379
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:16,134
I totally understand why
you're not calling me back.

380
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:17,654
Because, look,
if I saw what you saw,

381
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,374
then I'd be thinking
what you're thinking, you know.

382
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,054
Not that I presume to know
what you're thinking.

383
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,454
It's just a logical deduction
to think what you saw would be

384
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:25,414
what you think, if that's
in fact what you're thinking.

385
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:28,094
Actually, I can explain
a lot better than that,

386
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:29,934
if you just call me back.

387
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:31,174
Please.

388
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:32,654
At your earliest convenience.

389
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,454
Bye.

390
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:40,454
Grimes.

391
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,134
You got to give Milbarge
something, man.

392
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:44,694
If you don't,

393
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,814
he's not gonna let us
have our weekly poker game.

394
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:49,134
Yeah, don't do it
for us, Morgan.

395
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:50,214
Do it for BuyMoria.

396
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,094
So, Grimes,

397
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,094
have you thought any more
about our chat this morning?

398
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:58,734
Are you ready to help me
help BuyMoria?

399
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,534
Yeah, okay, Emmett.

400
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,094
Okay.

401
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:07,694
You want to know where Chuck
goes on these... service calls?

402
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,014
Yes, please.

403
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,974
He goes and he
fixes computers

404
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:14,734
and computer-
related software.

405
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:17,374
Why do you protect him?

406
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:18,894
What does that Charles
have over you?

407
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,334
Um, 23 years
of best friendship.

408
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:22,494
Oh, please.
I know everything

409
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:23,894
there is to know
about the man, but

410
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:25,614
you're not gonna hear it
from me. And if you're

411
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:26,734
looking for dirt,
well, nothing to say,

412
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,814
dude, 'cause
Chuck Bartowski

413
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:29,494
is the straightest
shooter I know.

414
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:32,054
Really?

415
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:33,174
That's right.

416
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:34,734
You have a bizarre sense
of straightest.

417
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,934
Since your besty
has two girlfriends.

418
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,734
What are you talking about?

419
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,734
I mean, isn't Bartowski's bimbo
a blonde?

420
00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:43,974
I don't know if Sarah's
a natural blonde.

421
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:45,654
I mean, it's kind of
impolite to ask, you know.

422
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:48,574
Oh, my God, it's Jill.

423
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:49,934
Thank you.
I didn't know its name.

424
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,934
That's, that's Chuck's
old college girlfriend.

425
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,534
Thank you again.

426
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:57,054
You're a font
of information.

427
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:59,014
Twice the intelligence
I had before.

428
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,414
How could he
not have told me?

429
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,494
Oh, you can have
your poker game now.

430
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,094
And do not worry.

431
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:06,774
I will not tell Bartowski

432
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,614
that his best buddy
was the weak link.

433
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,654
Cheers.

434
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:14,014
Sorry. Okay.

435
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,454
Jill, thank you,

436
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:16,974
thank you, thank you so much
for-for coming, Jill.

437
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:18,174
I appreciate it.

438
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:19,494
You have three seconds
to convince me

439
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,774
what I saw wasn't
what I saw.

440
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:23,534
That's gonna be a little tough,

441
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:24,774
because I can't
get into specifics

442
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:25,974
without you having
to know, like,

443
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,654
really high-level,
top-secret government...

444
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,014
We broke into Guy's room
trying to find

445
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:30,414
some of his research,
and we found

446
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:32,414
this box, but when we opened it,
it sprayed this stuff

447
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:34,974
all over Sarah and I,
so when you saw the two of us in

448
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,454
our underpants what you
really saw was two people

449
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:38,094
trying to wash off
what we thought was poison but

450
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:39,454
really turned out to be
powdered fruit punch.

451
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:40,454
See? There. Simple.
Do you believe me?

452
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:42,694
What kind of fruit punch?

453
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:44,494
Okay, now you're just
messing with me.

454
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:45,894
No, no. Chuck, I believe you.

455
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:47,334
Really? Becau--

456
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:49,414
I-I was listening to
what I just said right now,

457
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:50,334
and I sounded
completely ridiculous.

458
00:19:50,414 --> 00:19:52,774
Guy was crazy paranoid.

459
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,854
You couldn't open an e-mail
without solving a puzzle first.

460
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,494
If he cared about something,
he would have hidden it.

461
00:19:57,574 --> 00:19:58,974
Maybe the fruit punch
was a clue.

462
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:01,614
We have to go somewhere.

463
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:03,614
But before we do,

464
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:05,214
how do you feel
about blindfolds?

465
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,094
You brought her here?

466
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:18,334
Um...

467
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:19,814
Bartowski, it's not
a secret location

468
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:21,254
if you invite people over.

469
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:25,214
Okay, but Jill here,
Jill knows about Guy's puzzles.

470
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:27,614
They just found two dead FBI
agents in LaFleur's room.

471
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,574
Now's not the time to be planning
game night with your girlfriend.

472
00:20:30,654 --> 00:20:32,374
Jill, would you please
tell them what you told me,

473
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:35,454
about how the fruit punch
might actually be a clue.

474
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,894
Guy's paranoia manifested
itself in obscure ways:

475
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:39,894
odd literary references,
mathematical proofs.

476
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:41,414
The log-on for
his computer was

477
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,734
a randomly selected word
from a piece of Vogon poetry.

478
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:46,014
So what do you think
the fruit punch might mean?

479
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:47,534
What kind of fruit
punch was it?

480
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:51,854
Uh, I guess,
traditional fruit punch.

481
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:53,294
You guess?

482
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:55,694
Please tell me
you got the exact formula.

483
00:20:58,054 --> 00:20:59,334
Okay, um,

484
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:01,054
is there a mass spectrometer
around?

485
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,454
Casey, get the spectrometer.

486
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:04,774
Do we have one of those?

487
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,734
I can see what the boy
sees in her, huh?

488
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:18,174
Now we compare the crystalline
powder's chemical composition

489
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,534
with a list of
known products.

490
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:33,134
It's, um, it's
Rootin' Raspberry-flavored Hi-C.

491
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:40,014
Rootin' Raspberry?

492
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:42,254
Maybe... Maybe it has something
to do with a football team

493
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,214
or cheerleaders?

494
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:44,854
What about international waters?

495
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:46,494
High seas.

496
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:47,814
That's good.
That's good.

497
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:49,654
Wait, guys, guys,
this is a music box.

498
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:51,494
It's a music box.

499
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:53,054
It's not high sea-- S-E-A.

500
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,974
It's high "C," like
a musical note-- high "C."

501
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:57,214
Where's a pitch pipe
when you need one?

502
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,294
Hey! What?

503
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:06,214
Choir boy.

504
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,294
What? I wasn't hatched.

505
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,614
Ha-ha-ha!

506
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:15,734
Check it out!

507
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,734
Those are opera glasses.

508
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:23,854
Oh! No...

509
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:25,534
actually, they're not.

510
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:27,414
Um, this is a key.

511
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:29,614
A key to a very super secret
lock box.

512
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:33,294
The Culper Ring used to use
stuff like that to pass

513
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,934
information during the
Revolutionary War days.

514
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:38,334
Wow, Chuck, that's impressive.

515
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:39,734
Yeah, nice going there, brainiac.

516
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:41,974
But before you go getting
all full of yourself--

517
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:44,534
if this is the key,
where's the lock?

518
00:22:44,574 --> 00:22:48,814
The question, my dear Casey is:
Where's the opera?

519
00:22:55,814 --> 00:22:59,054
You're not concerned
to involve a civilian

520
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:01,334
in a covert government
investigation?

521
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,694
Ah, the girl's
personal knowledge

522
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:05,854
of Guy LaFleur makes
her of use to us.

523
00:23:05,894 --> 00:23:07,694
You sure you're not
just jealous

524
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:09,534
Bartowski's found himself
a new piece of asset?

525
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:12,774
Now where is that doofus?

526
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:19,614
Guy loved the opera.
Here's his family's box.

527
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:22,534
Whoa! Not bad.

528
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,134
You really feel like you're on
top of the action.

529
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:27,494
How do you know what
you're looking for?

530
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,974
Oh, well...

531
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:31,014
it'll match
the end of this key.

532
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:32,974
You know, something...

533
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:35,334
something...

534
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,734
...like this.

535
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,854
Shall we see what we got?

536
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:04,254
Bingo.

537
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:12,454
Hey, we got it!

538
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,894
Mr. Kolfi, we'll be out
of your hair

539
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,174
in a minute, okay?
I don't have a minute.

540
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,374
We are trying to rehearse.

541
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,534
This is a quick,
quick, quick minute.

542
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:18,734
You know, government stuff.

543
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:20,734
Watch out.

544
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:30,654
Casey, that's a bomb.

545
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:39,734
All right, rehearsal's over.
Everyone out of here!

546
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:40,934
Come on, Chuck, let's go!
We gotta go!

547
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:42,374
Wait!
This doesn't make any sense.

548
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,174
Guy wanted to help people,
not hurt them.

549
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:45,614
This isn't a bomb,
this is a clue.

550
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:47,094
Jill, if it looks like a bomb

551
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,174
and it ticks like a bomb,
then generally it's a bomb.

552
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,894
No, this is a puzzle we need to
solve before the timer runs out.

553
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:52,894
And what if you're wrong?

554
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,774
That doesn't happen.

555
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:00,894
Look, it's a music thing.
What's the opera?

556
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,374
Verdi's La Traviata.

557
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:03,974
Well, how does that go?

558
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:05,574
You play violin, right?
- Mm-hmm.

559
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,254
Your dad made you play
the flute.

560
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,294
Let's not bring that up.

561
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:15,614
Come on. Come on.
Get 'em all out!

562
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,054
All of 'em!
Go, go!

563
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:23,894
It's not happening.

564
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,894
Let's go.
Chuck, come on!

565
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:27,174
Look, look, Jill has yet
to be wrong, okay?

566
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:28,374
She says it's not a bomb,

567
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:29,414
I believe her.

568
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:34,574
Sir, we're sealing
this place off.

569
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,494
It's a flash drive.
This must be it.

570
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,574
That's how we
do that, huh?

571
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:52,334
Jill, it was all you.

572
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:53,974
No, you.
It was all you.

573
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:56,814
Okay, all right, all right.

574
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:00,774
I love love.

575
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,814
The flash drive containing
Guy's list is encrypted

576
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:07,654
using a 512-bit AES cipher.

577
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,534
Right now, the computer is
trying every possible key

578
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:11,774
against the encrypted data.

579
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:14,094
When it finds a match,
we'll have the identity

580
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:16,614
of every FULCRUM agent
with whom Guy was in contact.

581
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:17,774
How long will
that take?

582
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:19,294
Could be hours,
could be days.

583
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:20,934
Excellent work, you two.

584
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,974
Please thank the asset
for his service.

585
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,774
Where is Chuck
right now?

586
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:27,254
My guess would be rounding
second base.

587
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:36,614
You were
brilliant tonight.

588
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,574
No, you.

589
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:40,974
Mm-mm, all you.

590
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:46,574
Mm-mm-mm! No, no, no, I can't,
I can't, I can't do this.

591
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:50,014
You don't have to do a thing.
It's gonna be all me.

592
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:53,014
I... mm, that's very
gracious of you,

593
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:54,494
but no, that's not
what I'm saying.

594
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:56,254
I mean, I can't do this.

595
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:59,614
I can't, I can't do this.

596
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:01,854
Hey, come here.

597
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:04,454
Come here.
Come here. Look...

598
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:06,094
Buy More. Tomorrow.

599
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:07,774
What time?

600
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:10,614
Take the latent heat
of aquatic fusion...

601
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:12,614
Is that in calories per gram?

602
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:14,054
Of course.

603
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,174
And then subtract the atomic
number of thulium.

604
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:19,494
Got it?

605
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:20,694
Mm-hmm.

606
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,214
Okay, I'll see you then.

607
00:27:22,294 --> 00:27:23,294
Nerd code.

608
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:32,574
Hm.

609
00:27:32,654 --> 00:27:34,654
Hey, hey, buddy,

610
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,894
listen, I need you to cover
for me with Emmett today.

611
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:38,014
Gotta cut out early.

612
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:39,894
I see-- big night
with the lady, huh?

613
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:41,654
Actually, uh, yeah.

614
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,254
We're sneaking off for a
little romantic getaway.

615
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:45,134
Oh, how sweet.

616
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:48,214
So you and Sarah are taking
a little trip together, huh?

617
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:49,894
Yeah, we're, uh...

618
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:52,134
Just save it, Pinocchio.
I know you're seeing Jill.

619
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:55,174
You what? You... How?

620
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:57,014
How do you--
you know about Jill?

621
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:59,494
Apparently, I'm the last one
to know, too.

622
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:00,494
Milbarge knows about it.

623
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,414
This is Jill.

624
00:28:02,454 --> 00:28:04,254
I spent months helping you
get over her.

625
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,214
Look, Chuck, we're best friends,

626
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:08,534
but if you're not telling me
about this, what else

627
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:10,254
aren't you telling me?

628
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:14,694
Morgan, I'm so sorry, buddy.

629
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,774
I really am.
And-And trust me, there is so much

630
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:18,414
that I wish
that I could tell you,

631
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:19,934
but I, you know, can't.

632
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,654
Dude, you've never lied
to me before.

633
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:25,174
Exactly, so just trust
my judgment on this, okay?

634
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:29,894
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I gotta go.

635
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:30,974
Can you cover me?

636
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,414
Of course, I can cover
for you, man,

637
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:33,454
because we're best friends

638
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:34,774
and that's what
best friends do--

639
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:36,254
they lie for each other.

640
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:37,974
But they don't lie
to each other,

641
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:39,134
that's all.

642
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,094
Got it.

643
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:45,134
Trust me.
And thank you, thank you.

644
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,454
I'm gonna grab some
turkey jerky inside.

645
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:04,654
Do you want anything?

646
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:07,174
Uh, a water
and some Gummi Bears.

647
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:08,614
Okay, coming right up.

648
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:11,254
Have you heard from Chuck?

649
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:14,334
No. I'll do a GPS search
on his watch.

650
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,294
Little twerp's gone off grid.

651
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:30,174
Hey, no Gummi Bears,
so I hope you like sour...

652
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,734
Chuck, help!

653
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:32,734
Jill!

654
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:33,814
That's close enough.

655
00:29:33,894 --> 00:29:35,374
You have something
that belongs to me.

656
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:37,214
What? No. This?

657
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:38,894
No, no, no. See, I paid--

658
00:29:38,974 --> 00:29:40,414
I paid for this.
But you can have it.

659
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:41,694
Why don't you just
let the girl go

660
00:29:41,774 --> 00:29:43,094
and then you can tell me
what it is exactly

661
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:44,534
that you've lost, then maybe
I can help you find it?

662
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:46,894
Bring me LaFleur's list
or the girl dies.

663
00:29:46,974 --> 00:29:48,894
Opera House.

664
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:49,934
Midnight.

665
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:03,225
They took her!
The hell you been?

666
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:05,345
You deliberately went off grid.
Some guy just took Jill!

667
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:07,305
He said if I didn't bring him
Guy's list of

668
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:08,545
FULCRUM agents,
he's gonna kill her.

669
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,465
That's not gonna happen.
Yeah, of course not.

670
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:12,505
I'm gonna bring him the list,
and I'm gonna get her back!

671
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:14,065
No, you're not.

672
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,385
They'll kill her either way.

673
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,225
What? No.
That can't happen.

674
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:18,505
Please, Casey,
will you please help me?

675
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:24,505
No.

676
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:26,665
I gotta call Washington
and report it.

677
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:28,105
You stay right here.
Don't move.

678
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:29,105
You've done
enough damage already.

679
00:30:35,985 --> 00:30:37,025
General,
we have a situation.

680
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,065
Stop!

681
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:45,265
Walker, shoot him!
Chuck, freeze!

682
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,625
Don't.

683
00:30:46,665 --> 00:30:48,265
If you try to take that,
I have to stop you.

684
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,305
Please, let me go!

685
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:51,905
This is treason, Bartowski.

686
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:52,865
Please, just let me go.

687
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:54,505
Shoot him, Walker.

688
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:55,745
Shoot him
in the knee.

689
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:01,945
I'm sorry.

690
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:02,865
I have to.

691
00:31:05,145 --> 00:31:07,265
It's Jill.

692
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:39,305
You could've
shot him.

693
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:40,345
He's the Intersect.

694
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:42,145
Is that all he is?

695
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,425
You could've at least
kneecapped him.

696
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,345
I have a trace on Chuck.
He's heading downtown.

697
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,305
You get the car,
I'll get the guns.

698
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:12,745
Jill!

699
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:14,105
Chuck.

700
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:15,785
Can we dispense
with the pillow talk

701
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:16,825
and just do this?

702
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:18,105
Yeah, yeah,
okay, okay.

703
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:19,425
Let her go.
Not so fast.

704
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:21,545
You've seen mine,
now show me yours.

705
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:24,745
That's fine, but first I need to
know that she's gonna be safe.

706
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:26,265
That's not how this works.

707
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:28,385
You hand over the list,
or I shoot you both.

708
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,865
That's not how
this works either!

709
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:33,145
Go wait in the car, Chuck.

710
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:34,225
Don't move, Chuck.

711
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:36,465
Stay right where you are.

712
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:38,025
I've got a sharpshooter
trained on you.

713
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,665
Now I have the sniper.

714
00:32:56,745 --> 00:32:57,865
I-I still have the advantage.

715
00:32:57,945 --> 00:33:00,265
Somebody give me the list,
or I shoot Chuck.

716
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:01,625
Yeah, go ahead
and shoot him.

717
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,345
You know, I was thinking about
shooting him myself.

718
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:04,505
That's a great--
Why would you-- What, what?!

719
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:05,985
What are you, crazy?!

720
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,465
How about nobody,
how about nobody shoots Chuck?!

721
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:08,665
I'm not Sarah, Chuck.

722
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:11,545
Give him that list,

723
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,385
and I will end your miserable
existence. It's your choice.

724
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:14,865
Would you rather
I shoot the girl?

725
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:16,265
Please don't.
I would rather you not shoot

726
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:17,905
the girl-- just point
the gun back at me, please.

727
00:33:17,985 --> 00:33:19,105
No!

728
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:20,065
No, go ahead, shoot the girl.

729
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,185
Some situations,

730
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:22,385
collateral damage
is unavoidable.

731
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:24,105
No.
It's always avoidable.

732
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,945
Look, I have it, okay?
Here it is.

733
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:26,665
Right here, here's the list.
- Bartowski!

734
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:30,065
Look, you got
a better plan?

735
00:33:30,145 --> 00:33:31,945
'Cause I'm not okay with
collateral damage right now.

736
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:33,265
Here you go.

737
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,705
Here's your list of all
the FULCRUM agents.

738
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:43,345
Well, Mr. Casey,
FULCRUM would rather

739
00:33:43,385 --> 00:33:45,345
you not know who we have
inside government.

740
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:53,185
Show must go on.
Now, Sarah!

741
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:56,745
Okay. Hey, hey. You're okay.

742
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:05,705
You're okay...

743
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,705
Oh, I'm so sorry.

744
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:09,705
I'm so sorry.
You okay?

745
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:12,145
You okay? You okay?
You okay? You okay?

746
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:14,345
I am now.

747
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:19,025
Ah, poker night.
And all I had to do

748
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:20,145
was rat out my best friend.

749
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,425
I saw that, Grimes.

750
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:26,065
Oh, don't worry.

751
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:29,105
What's a card game without
a couple of brewskis?

752
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:32,785
And by "couple,"
do you mean 14?

753
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:35,105
Oh, God.

754
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:38,745
Mmm. Mmm!

755
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:43,425
I won't forget the loyalty
you showed, Grimes.

756
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:45,105
Tonight, we drink.

757
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:46,265
Tomorrow,
Bartowski gets his.

758
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:47,105
Whatever, dude.

759
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,985
Beer?
Oh, no.

760
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:51,865
I brought my own. Whoo!

761
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:56,865
Mmm.

762
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,385
Mmm.

763
00:34:58,425 --> 00:34:59,825
Mmm.

764
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:01,225
Tastes like high school!
- Donkeys wild.

765
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:03,305
Let's go-- who's gonna put
the "poker" in "strip poker."

766
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,665
Let's play it out, boys,
let's play it out.

767
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:09,065
Are you sure you're okay?

768
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,385
I think so.

769
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:12,265
Is this a normal day
at the office for you?

770
00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:14,385
Yeah, except Casey
doesn't usually sing.

771
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:15,705
Okay, first I'm gonna
have you arrested

772
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:16,825
for crimes
against your country.

773
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:18,145
Then I'll take you down
to Club Gitmo,

774
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:19,705
hang you up by your fingernails
with the boys...

775
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,265
Hey! I appreciate the threats,
I really do.

776
00:35:21,305 --> 00:35:22,785
But can I please explain myself?

777
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:25,545
Explain what? You gave away
classified intel to the enemy.

778
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:27,185
Now we're never gonna know
the identities

779
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:28,345
of those FULCRUM agents.

780
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,225
Ye of little faith.

781
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:32,225
Casey, come on, buddy.

782
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:33,785
Do you really think that I would

783
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,785
give that guy
the list to destroy

784
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,825
before I made myself a copy?

785
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:41,425
Hey.
Q-36 game copier.

786
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:43,505
Thankfully, Morgan is
too cheap and unethical

787
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,145
to pay for his own
video game entertainment.

788
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:48,305
Canada's greatest gift
since Shania Twain.

789
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:50,705
Thank you for
saving my life.

790
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:53,545
Sorry for not
trusting you with Chuck.

791
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,025
You want to pay me back?

792
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:58,425
Don't hurt him again.

793
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,945
I won't.

794
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,385
I wouldn't.

795
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,785
I care about Chuck.

796
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:08,985
Me, too.

797
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:10,545
It's my job to protect him.

798
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:15,425
From anything.

799
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,141
Hey, Emmett.

800
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:31,661
Stop screaming.

801
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:34,581
Wow.

802
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,181
Little too much fun
last night, huh, pal?

803
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,221
I should never have gone
for that second Fuzzy Navel.

804
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:43,821
That wine cooler had
four percent alcohol.

805
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:45,821
I know. I know.

806
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:47,501
I tell you what, though,

807
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,461
let's talk about it,

808
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,981
in my office.

809
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:53,461
Yeah, come on.
This way.

810
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:58,461
You know, I wanted to
talk to you today about

811
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:00,181
a little technique
that we developed around here.

812
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,261
It worked wonders
during the Harry Tang years.

813
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,421
Can we talk about this
some other time, Grimes?

814
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:05,581
You see, BuyMoria

815
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:08,461
is a country
governed by law.

816
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:11,901
But occasionally, a
vigilante hero has to rise

817
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:15,141
and take that law
into his own hands to protect

818
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:17,141
the country
that he loves.

819
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,461
This is from last night.

820
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:20,301
After poker.

821
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,821
I'm Big Mike!

822
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,301
What you doing here, Emmett?!

823
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:27,701
Is that you in Big Mike's office
after hours?

824
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,741
That's weird,
because

825
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:31,741
I thought that was off-limits.

826
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:33,061
Even to you.

827
00:37:33,141 --> 00:37:36,701
I didn't go six years

828
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:40,301
to community college
to assistant manage

829
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:42,661
a bunch of register jockeys!

830
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:46,821
Oh, man, you do not look good.

831
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,181
Now, I know
that we're...

832
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:54,701
countrymen
and all.

833
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:57,661
I hate to have to run
this up the flagpole.

834
00:37:57,701 --> 00:37:59,581
You wouldn't.

835
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,741
Damn right I would.

836
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,141
If you don't call off
this witch hunt

837
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:03,101
for Chuck Bartowski,
this goes public.

838
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:03,981
Do we understand each other?

839
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,621
Good.

840
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,781
Viva BuyMoria.

841
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:13,501
Tastes like high school.

842
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,661
Okay, computer's back up.

843
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:19,421
It's decoding the list.
Just a matter of time

844
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:21,181
before we learn the identities
of FULCRUM's agents.

845
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:31,741
Ooh.

846
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:32,981
Oh!

847
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,501
Hey. Hey, yeah, hey.

848
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:36,301
That's fine, I wasn't
gonna pack that one anyway.

849
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,941
Oh, wait. Hey, no.

850
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:42,261
The hotel's
booked, so...

851
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:45,101
we should probably go
if we're gonna beat traffic!

852
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:46,781
Or we could just get the weekend
started right now.

853
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:48,581
Uh, what-what about,
what about the...

854
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:51,901
Hm... I have some
spy moves of my own.

855
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,661
We're gonna do this again?

856
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:02,981
You know what?

857
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:04,141
He had a big day today.

858
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:05,221
How about we give him

859
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,301
a little
break, huh?

860
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,741
Encryption key's been found.

861
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,541
Safe at last.
