1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:05,067
This is my boss,
Charles Bartowski.

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,733
<i>A computer repairman
with all the</i>

3
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:09,033
<i>government's secrets
in his head.</i>

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,234
<i>This is his girl, Sarah Walker.</i>

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,701
<i>A CIA agent with more
than just killer looks.</i>

6
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:24,901
<i>And when these
two spies first met,</i>

7
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:27,300
<i>it was love at first fight.</i>

8
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:39,466
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

9
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,066
<i>I'm Morgan.
It's my job</i>

10
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,933
<i>to keep an eye
on the both of them,</i>

11
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:45,067
<i>which isn't always easy.</i>

12
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:04,967
Oh, hey, dude.

13
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,399
I had the most
incredible dream, man.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,300
I was, uh...
Hey.

15
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,666
Uh, do you want some?

16
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,567
Hello? Morgan?

17
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,199
Hi.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,600
Do you want some orange juice?

19
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,934
Orange juice?
Orange juice.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,466
Absolutely.
Man, that sounds good.

21
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:21,466
Vitamin Ds are

22
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:22,967
very important-
Vitamin Cs.

23
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:24,032
Vitamin C, singular.

24
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,567
Great.
Sorry.

25
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,233
The jug's so big.

26
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,767
Jug- I'm sorry, I...

27
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,267
I hate you, Chuck.
I hate you.

28
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:39,466
Good morning, buddy.

29
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,166
Okay, I get it.

30
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,633
You're having tons
and tons of sex.

31
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:43,967
Congratulations, Warren Beatty.

32
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,399
Who said anything about...

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,900
Your big, goofy grin
said it, okay?

34
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,666
And, you know, it's kind of
an insult for those of us

35
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,867
living in the apartment
who aren't having sex.

36
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:52,133
Which is me.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,300
Sorry. Sorry about that.

38
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:55,733
I'm just really happy.

39
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:56,999
Well, duh. You're dating

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,366
a leggy Valkyrie who has
an aversion to clothing.

41
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,900
Says the guy who likes to sleep

42
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,299
in the nude.

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,566
Au buffo.

44
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,233
Oh, well, I'll have you
know that I've actually

45
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:06,367
made the very painful concession
of wearing pajamas.

46
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:07,867
I mean, you never know

47
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,500
when she's going to be
stopping by now and...

48
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:11,401
Well, I think you can pretty
much count on Sarah being here

49
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,032
every night,
because I'm about to ask her

50
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,533
if she wants to move in.

51
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,267
Okay. Well, you two
probably have a lot

52
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:19,234
to talk about.

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,066
Hi.

54
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,333
I was going to surprise you.

55
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:26,666
Take you out to a nice dinner

56
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,734
and give you your own key.

57
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,566
But...

58
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,501
How would you like to move in?

59
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:35,067
Why would we do that?

60
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:37,967
Why? Well,

61
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:40,501
because I figured since
you're sleeping here

62
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,800
most nights anyway...

63
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,066
We're not a normal couple,

64
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,400
so why do we need to pretend
like we have a normal life?

65
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,633
Who's pretending?

66
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,299
Okay, I, I didn't mean it
like that.

67
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,133
I love working with you
and I love being with you, so...

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,234
Why mess with
a good thing, right?

69
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,666
We can talk more after work.

70
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:56,967
Right, yeah.

71
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,500
Yeah, we'll talk
more after work,

72
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,601
'cause I know how good

73
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:01,833
a thing this is.

74
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:02,967
What are you doing?

75
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:05,067
Well, I left my gun
in my hotel room.

76
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,300
No, what are you doing,
storing your guns in my couch?

77
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,734
Morgan
Morgan could find those. What, you've not heard

78
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:11,867
of the 30-foot rule?

79
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,868
As a matter of fact,
no, I have not.

80
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,567
A good agent should never be
without a backup weapon.

81
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,066
Well, have you ever
heard of the Bartowski rule?

82
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,666
No firearms in my apartment.

83
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,367
Well, not if you want
to live with a spy.

84
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:26,067
<i>Hey, Chuck. Got your message.</i>

85
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,733
<i>Everything is fine.</i>

86
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,634
<i>Sorry we can't talk.
We're moving to a new clinic.</i>

87
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:30,867
<i>We're here, babe.</i>

88
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:33,567
Hang up.
Love you. Bye.

89
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,333
Excuse me,
Doctors Without Borders.

90
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:42,634
Any idea where
the field clinic is?

91
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,601
Nothing?

92
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,300
Babe, I think
this is the clinic.

93
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,933
Honey, I have seen
more patients

94
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:51,834
in two weeks than
I've seen in my first

95
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,366
few years as a doctor.

96
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,566
You have any idea

97
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,132
who the men with the guns are?

98
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,633
The UN wear blue berets

99
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,667
and the FDLR wear black berets.

100
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:02,667
Great, but Devon, these guys
aren't wearing any berets.

101
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,066
Hey. Hey.

102
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,967
Whoever they are,
they're in charge.

103
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:10,267
Honey, what have we gotten ourselves
into? Remember what they said

104
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,166
about this being the toughest
job you'll ever love?

105
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,999
We're making a difference.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,701
I know, I know.
That's not what's getting to me.

107
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,901
What's getting to me
is the not showering

108
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,099
and the not sleeping
and the not knowing

109
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,566
who the men with the guns are.

110
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,467
Hmm?

111
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,333
Well, how about a date night?

112
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,900
I'll cook dinner
for you tonight.

113
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,868
Just you and me under the stars.

114
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,834
Okay.

115
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,433
I'm sure it'll
clear up any minute.

116
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:35,433
Mm, mwa.

117
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:37,099
You're my boy.

118
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
Over here!
Follow me.

119
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:39,833
You're in charge.

120
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:40,999
<i>What do you mean</i>

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,166
"we're not in charge"?

122
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,267
Are you demoting us, General?
No.

123
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:46,801
You will be acting
in an observational capacity

124
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,099
on this mission.

125
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,466
The primary agents

126
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,534
are named
Craig and Laura Turner.

127
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,333
Never heard of them.

128
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,132
AKA George and Bitsy
Witherspoon?

129
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,366
The CIA team who stopped

130
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:58,267
the Air France
hijacking in '86?

131
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,300
AKA John and Suzie Smythe?

132
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,334
The ones who broke up
the Uranium smuggling ring

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,566
back in '91.

134
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,433
I could go on and on

135
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:07,767
listing the Turner's aliases
and accomplishments.

136
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,566
So, they've been
around the CIA block.

137
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,833
Well, that's good for them

138
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,501
They have also been married
for the last 30 years-

139
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,733
more or less.

140
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:18,501
And this is
relevant to us, how?

141
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,634
As long as you
and Agent Bartowski insist

142
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,433
on keeping a personal
relationship,

143
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:25,234
I insist you learn
how to go about it properly.

144
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,634
Your mission is to watch
and learn from the best

145
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,634
couple the CIA
has ever produced.

146
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,333
Hmm.

147
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:32,399
And you, Colonel Casey...

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,801
I'll head on down to Pendleton,

149
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,233
recertify my weapons training.

150
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,634
<i>It's not your training
that concerns me.</i>

151
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,701
I'm talking about Morgan Grimes.

152
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,801
It was your idea to make him
a part of the team.

153
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:46,000
It's your job to make him
field-ready.

154
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,833
You can't be serious, General.

155
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,533
He's a diamond in the rough-

156
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,767
very, very rough,
but I'm sure you'll make him

157
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,167
sparkle.

158
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,534
Diamond.

159
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,667
Diamond in the rough...

160
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,967
Would you please sit down?

161
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,132
You're making me nervous.

162
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,933
The Turners are going
to be here any minute.

163
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,199
What, you've never met

164
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,267
a CIA agent before?
You, what- come on.

165
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:14,800
You heard Beckman- these guys

166
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,533
are the best of the best.
They're a super spy couple.

167
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:19,234
I don't want them thinking
we're a couple of rubes.

168
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,501
What a dump!

169
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,767
Can you imagine being
stationed here?

170
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,434
Remember when the CIA
held rooms for us

171
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:28,299
at the Grand Ambassador?

172
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,067
Ah, the salad days!

173
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,633
What'd you say
their names were again?

174
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:36,267
I believe their names are
Bertruski or Bertrowski.

175
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,066
Something ethnic.

176
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,266
Two young agency hotshots.

177
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:41,400
And they're here.
And they're here!

178
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,234
Dear God, it's us 30 years ago.

179
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,367
Look, Sarah,
that's us in 30 years.

181
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,133
So there you have it:
Operation Mongoose.

182
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,667
Made it out of Berlin
with half the KGB

183
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:46,100
on my tail. If it hadn't
been for that woman

184
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,534
in the fur coat
with the AK-47...

185
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,166
Enough with the Cold War
stories,

186
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,600
darling...

187
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,766
You're boring our hosts.

188
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:53,900
No-no, no.

189
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,434
This is, this is,
this is fascinating, uh,

190
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,233
to me at-at least.

191
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:01,000
A toast, Charles,
to old spy stories.

192
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, Mrs. Turner,
can I get you a drink?

193
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,234
No, thank you.
I'm fine

194
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,166
with my water.

195
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,100
The wife does not partake,
so I guess I'll just have

196
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,067
to toast for both of us.

197
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:17,868
A serviceable Manhattan,
Charles.

198
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,701
Is there something wrong
with your cherry?

199
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,934
Actually, a true
Manhattan is made

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,934
with a rare and delicate
marasca cherry...

201
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,433
The only place
you can find those,

202
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,166
here in LA would be...

203
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,267
The Grand Ambassador.
The Grand Ambassador.

204
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,500
Don't be a booze snob,

205
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,099
darling.
Getting back to your

206
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,000
story, though,
the woman in the fur coat,

207
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,700
I'm assuming, was you,
Mrs. Turner?

208
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,300
Mm. That's how
the two of you met?

209
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,366
How we got divorced.

210
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,434
The hussy in the fur was

211
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,633
a Russian double agent.

212
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,333
I thought the two of
you were married.

213
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,099
Remarried- three times.

214
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,000
Some women are too special

215
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,967
to marry just once.

216
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,167
My, look at the time.

217
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,999
Goodness, we'd
better get going.

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,867
Oh, so soon?

219
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:03,901
This has been just great.

220
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:05,868
Sarah and I cannot wait
to work with the two of you.

221
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,199
Oh, you won't have to.

222
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,900
The mission is
tonight, Charles.

223
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,033
The target is Otto Von Vogel.

224
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,299
Otto has created

225
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,200
a decryption program

226
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:16,767
that could render
CIA security useless.

227
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,267
Tonight's party is
a smoke screen for him

228
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,834
to meet potential buyers.
Our job is to access

229
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,667
Otto's master suite,
where he stores the software.

230
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:26,233
Okay, great. What do
you want us to do?

231
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,500
Your job:

232
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,534
Watch and learn.

233
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:33,601
I can't wait to watch
these two in action.

234
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,901
It is going to be great.

235
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:37,500
What?

236
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,132
So what are Chuck
and Sarah up to tonight?

237
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,200
Some sort of sexy
spy dinner party?

238
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,801
Shh!
Oh, right. Sorry, sorry.

239
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:45,533
I don't know.
You ask me, this whole

240
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,233
man gig's starting to become a real snore, you know?

241
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,834
When am I going to put the hurt on
some terrorist? You know, get in there?

242
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,000
Whatever it is
you think you know

243
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:55,267
about being a spy,
you're wrong, hmm?

244
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:58,033
Oh, oh...
Okay.

245
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,600
You're a child.

246
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,266
You're a liability to the team.

247
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,167
You're not doing anything until
you've been properly trained.

248
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,466
Understood?

249
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:05,766
Wait a minute-
does that mean...?

250
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:06,933
I can't believe
I'm going to say this.

251
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,132
I'm going to Langley!

252
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,634
You're not going
anywhere, jackass.

253
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:12,066
I can teach you everything
you need to know

254
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,967
right here in the store.
Come on.

255
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,868
Oh, yeah. Start with the neck
thing. That was awesome!

256
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,367
So, that's Otto, I take it.

257
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:28,132
Avoid him and his guards.

258
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,701
If anyone asks
who you are, tell them

259
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,399
you're our nephew, Bernard.

260
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,800
Actually, tell them
she's our niece.

261
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,967
No offense, Charles.

262
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,868
No, none taken.

263
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,099
Shall we work the room first?

264
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,000
After you, my love.

265
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:43,801
Here we go.

266
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,533
How's the tennis elbow, Monty?

267
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:48,999
Can I give you
a word of advice?

268
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,299
Eat and rest.

269
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,766
You see, consummate
professionals.

270
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,968
I mean, what do you think makes
them such a great spy team?

271
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,367
Um, a lifetime of training.

272
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,701
Very funny. I'm talking
about them being a couple.

273
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,566
I honestly can't
believe the CIA

274
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,999
doesn't hire more of us.

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,334
They're not that great.
Oh, don't be jealous.

276
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,267
I'm not jealous. I'm just saying
they're not that great.

277
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,534
Sarah, we, uh, we may
have a slight problem.

278
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,634
There you are Otto, old boy!

279
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:19,933
We heard you were in town

280
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,533
and assumed you were
having a party.

281
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,968
I don't recall putting
you two on the guest list.

282
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:28,800
I'm just kidding.

283
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,701
Look at your faces!

284
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,601
Oh, Otto, you are terrible.

285
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,234
As they say in my country,

286
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,968
<i>"mein Haus ist ihr Haus."</i>

287
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,968
Textbook subversion.
Not bad.

288
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,133
You know, we could take a page

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,667
out of the Turners' playbook.

290
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,267
You're not going to ask me to
move in with you again, are you?

291
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:54,167
No, why... Well,
not now. Maybe later.

292
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,067
At ease.

293
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,733
All right, there
are three qualities

294
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,299
that make for
an effective field agent:

295
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,299
Subversion, Me.

296
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,299
Stealth...
Me.

297
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,501
Strength...

298
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:06,666
First things first.

299
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,367
See that customer over there?

300
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,533
Oh, my goodness-
super-hottie?

301
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,132
Yeah, I clocked her
when she first came in.

302
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,566
I want you to get
her phone number.

303
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,466
Yeah, right.

304
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:18,700
No, seriously,
what's the first step?

305
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:19,933
A spy must be able

306
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:21,934
to manipulate any target
at any time.

307
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,800
In the field, it can make
the difference

308
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,967
between life and death.

309
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:27,567
Copy that. Yes, sir.

310
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:29,066
Ooh, what about her, though?

311
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,700
Silver-tops
really eat me up.

312
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,601
You have your target. Engage.

313
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,567
* *

314
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,834
Get on with it.

315
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,801
Hmm.

316
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,100
Target has been neutralized.

317
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,434
I thought Bartowski
was hopeless.

318
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,434
* *

319
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,334
Well, I'm not sure
where the Turners went.

320
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,300
Maybe they already
made their move.

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,033
I thought she said
she didn't drink?

322
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Yeah.

323
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,366
Hit me.

324
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:37,868
Hi. Hi,
Mrs. Turner, uh...

325
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,300
Sarah and I were just
wondering if the mission

326
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,634
is still going
according to plan.

327
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,099
Is, um, something wrong?

328
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,233
Her.

329
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:47,767
It's disgusting.

330
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,100
Man's old enough
to be her father!

331
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:53,634
Perhaps he's just giving
her some fatherly advice?

332
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,366
Bastard left his Mic on.

333
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,000
CRAIG
You are a very, naughty girl.

334
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,167
It's too bad my wife is here.

335
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:03,434
Perhaps we can hook up
later at my hotel?

336
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:06,634
The man's nothing but
a CIA-sanctioned gigolo.

337
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,467
Oh... you don't
mean that.

338
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:12,032
Oh, wait, uh,

339
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,166
where, where are you going?

340
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,100
Upstairs to steal the software.

341
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,633
At least one of us

342
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,534
is still a professional.

343
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,333
I'll handle this.

344
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,766
Here, let me...
Get...

345
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:28,133
Get your hands off me!
Please, you're fighting me.

346
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,833
Don't touch me!
You're making a scene.

347
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,333
Don't touch me!

348
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,766
Dear Lord, my back.

349
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:33,933
Oh, this is not good.

350
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:35,733
It's an old service injury.

351
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:38,300
Oh, you threw your back out
with a Havana hooker.

352
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,734
It was all in the line of
duty, my dear. Oh, right, yeah.

353
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:42,700
Give us a moment.
Don't even start with me.

354
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,667
It will fix itself-
the back, not her.

355
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,566
We should get out of here

356
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,100
before they blow
all of our covers.

357
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,300
Don't touch me!

358
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,867
What about the software?

359
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,334
Let's show the Turners
how it's done, hmm?

360
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,534
Is there a nurse here?

361
00:14:57,601 --> 00:15:00,033
Someone in a short skirt?

362
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:06,467
Master suite.
Master suite...

363
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,534
Master suite.
Yeah.

364
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:15,801
Otto's safe
has to be around here

365
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:17,934
somewhere.

366
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,634
<i>Gesundheit.
Thank you.</i>

367
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,299
There's got to be
a cat around here.

368
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
My allergies are going crazy.

369
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:28,834
Whoa. Hey! Look at this!

370
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,199
Our buddy, Otto, into some

371
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,901
kinky stuff,
even by German standards.

372
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,433
Chuck?

373
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:40,600
Yeah?

374
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,501
Put the whip down.

375
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,067
Why?

376
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,800
Not a fan of the whip,
are you, big fella?

377
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:13,200
I'll just put this away and let
you get back to your cat nap.

378
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:15,167
Ow, gee!

379
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,932
Chuck!
Mm-hmm?

380
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:30,932
Run!

381
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,833
Yeah, go, go, go, go!

382
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,500
The software-

383
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:37,401
the software is
on the tiger's collar.

384
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,000
Get the chair.

385
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,166
If I just had my tranq gun.

386
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,066
No, no, that's not a tranq gun.

387
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,233
I am not letting
you shoot a tiger.

388
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:47,767
They are endangered
and majestic.

389
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,967
Do you have any better ideas?
I think what we need

390
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:52,067
to be asking ourselves
is what would the Turners do?

391
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,533
<i>Survive in the field,</i>

392
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:55,366
an agent also has
to employ stealth.

393
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:56,500
Good. Done-
are you kidding me?

394
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:57,600
I move like a cat.

395
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,534
I want you to steal
something for me.

396
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,999
Look at these hands-
small and nimble.

397
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,134
Steal anything in the store.
Look at this. Boom. Done.

398
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,366
I got...
No!

399
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,500
I have something a little

400
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,401
more difficult in mind.

401
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,099
Oh, come on, really?

402
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,466
Suck it up.

403
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,534
Target acquired.

404
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,466
Okay, okay,
the Turners aren't perfect.

405
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,099
I'm willing
to modify my opinion.

406
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,533
She's a drunk
and he's a philanderer.

407
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:20,099
As a team, they're a total mess.

408
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,134
Well, come on, they're not
completely without their charms.

409
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,267
I mean, there could be worse
people that we could turn into.

410
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,233
I would rather be
eaten alive by a tiger.

411
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,501
Speaking of, I am done waiting
around for Otto to find us.

412
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,333
Let's get the software
and get out of here.

413
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:32,467
Shh-shh-shh.

414
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:34,467
I've heard that noise before.

415
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:37,501
It sounds like...

416
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,634
<i>Your mission,</i>

417
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,967
<i>moron, is to steal
Big Mike's keycard.</i>

418
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,467
See? What'd I tell you?

419
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:05,668
Sleeping just like Big Mike
after eating a baker's dozen.

420
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,066
Okay, shh.

421
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,967
Shh.
Shh.

422
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:15,066
Okay, give me the gun.
I'll cover you.

423
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,433
No, no, no, I'll cover you.

424
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:18,467
You get the collar.
No, trust me.

425
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,366
You have that,
that feline instinct.

426
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,166
I know how to use
a gun better than you do.

427
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,434
See, still don't think
that's a great idea.

428
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,401
Just do it.
Okay, fine.

429
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,134
* *

430
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:28,601
Oh, my God!

431
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,366
Why didn't you shoot it!

432
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,767
It was about to eat me.

433
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:36,199
You said he was majestic.

434
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,434
He's a little majestic.

435
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,401
Come on.

436
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,466
Grimes?

437
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,966
I told you

438
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:53,700
I don't like people looking
at me when I'm asleep.

439
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,601
Mm-hmm. I know, it's just

440
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:57,466
you had me so worried, I...

441
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,199
For a second there,
I thought you were dead.

442
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,199
What's that in your hand?

443
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,366
This is your keycard.

444
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,033
Yeah, and, uh, I thought
it was cutting off

445
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,899
your air supply, your
air-air pipe. Mm-hmm.

446
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,799
You know and then your esophagi.
And then, I'm looking

447
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,366
and I'm like, there's jelly
all over... Give me that.

448
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,033
Yeah. You can take it,

449
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,866
'cause I was just going to wash
it for you. I'm a grown man.

450
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,167
Yeah, you are.
I can clean up after myself.

451
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:16,033
Naturally.

452
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,934
But you can get me another one
of those doughnuts.

453
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,933
Thank you for going
to all this trouble.

454
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,334
Babe, I'm your husband.

455
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,733
It's my job to take care
of you, honey.

456
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,933
Still, I feel silly.

457
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,832
You know, there's people
here with real problems.

458
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,366
You get to feel how you feel.

459
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,700
It's a lot to adjust to.

460
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,833
I guess I'm having a hard time
shaking the whole

461
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,333
city girl thing.

462
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,700
I'm sort of...

463
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,033
Out of my element.

464
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,701
I'm not really
an outdoorsy type.

465
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,767
Don't move, babe.

466
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,366
Devon, what are you looking at?

467
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,267
Don't breathe.
Do not...

468
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:05,000
It's okay.

469
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,400
You're the new guys, right?

470
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:09,200
The husband and wife team?
Yeah, I'm, uh, Justin.

471
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,300
Camp security coordinator.

472
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:13,467
Um... you might want
to set up camp

473
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:15,534
a little further away
from the perimeter.

474
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:16,566
The animals get a little

475
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,066
curious at night.

476
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,200
You okay, honey?
Oh, yeah.

477
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,099
We're making a difference.
We're making a difference.

478
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,600
Sorry I wasn't around
when you guys arrived.

479
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,033
Outside of your
snake friend here,

480
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,633
we're all very grateful
to have you both here.

481
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,466
Yeah, we need all
the doctors we can find.

482
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,633
Thanks.

483
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:31,099
Yeah, anytime.

484
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,867
And, uh... welcome to Africa.

485
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,300
Yeah.

486
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:37,433
We're okay.

487
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,534
We'll be all right.

488
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,567
We're all right.

489
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,367
Okay, here's the
deal: We'll call

490
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:50,334
the Turners from the road.

491
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,799
Impressive.

492
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,768
You know, I didn't think
they had it in them.

493
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,466
What are you guys doing?

494
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:00,234
We're teaching you a little
something about spying.

495
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:01,799
Lesson one:
trust no one...

496
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,067
Except your partner, of course.

497
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,500
We'll take Otto's software.

498
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,768
Wha...? What?! No, no!

499
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,134
You're the Turners!
You can't be

500
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,533
doing this to us.

501
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,300
Don't feel bad, Charles.

502
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,201
We're the best at this.

503
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,532
What do you mean,
they went rogue?

504
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,200
General, Mrs. Turner
pulled a gun on me.

505
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:26,434
And might I add,
I think she may have

506
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,834
a bit of a problem
with the, uh, sauce.

507
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,699
Uh, the Turners
stole Otto's software.

508
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,434
The Turners are two of the most
decorated spies in the CIA.

509
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,434
There must be some explanation
for their behavior.

510
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,833
I suggest you find it.

511
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:40,967
Well, I'd be happy
to track them down

512
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:42,833
if you want to ask
them yourself.

513
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,033
Colonel, you have your mission.

514
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:45,233
Oh, yeah, how is that

515
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,632
field training
with Morgan going?

516
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:47,799
Put it this way.

517
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,900
He makes you look
like a natural-born operative.

518
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:52,267
If you can't make Morgan Grimes
field-ready,

519
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:55,301
I'm sending you both
to boot camp in Pendleton.

520
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:57,334
That is all.

521
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,532
Great. This is just great.

522
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:01,833
This is, this is perfect.

523
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,467
Not only did
the Turners sell us out,

524
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:05,500
they make us look like complete
amateurs in the process.

525
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:06,899
Chuck, why are you
doing dishes?

526
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,766
Please? I'm a Bartowski.

527
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:11,867
This is what we do
to deal with stress. We clean.

528
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,201
Okay, I can see
that you're upset.

529
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,900
<i>I am upset. The Turners were
supposed to be our role models,</i>

530
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:18,733
and instead, they
turn out to be these

531
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,566
coldhearted
double-crossing traitors.

532
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,066
And now, now you're never
gonna move in with me.

533
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,400
Chuck, we're not the Turners.

534
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,766
Yeah, I know.

535
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:27,201
But I kind of liked the idea
that we could become them.

536
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:28,266
Well, right now,

537
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,899
we really need
to focus on finding them.

538
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,401
Sarah, how? The Turners have
been spying for 30 years.

539
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:35,734
They've got dozens of aliases
and a million different places

540
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,133
they could disappear to.

541
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:38,733
Whatever beach
they're on right now

542
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,499
I hope that Mr.
Turner's enjoying

543
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,899
his perfect little Manhattan.

544
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
The Grand Ambassador.

545
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,166
What?
He said last night

546
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,267
that that was the only place
in Los Angeles

547
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,401
that had the right kind
of cherries.

548
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:51,233
Hold, hold on a
second. Hold on.

549
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,400
You... you don't
actually think

550
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,000
they're still hanging
around here, do you?

551
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:57,234
Well, they might if they already
had a buyer for the software.

552
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,767
They picked the wrong couple
to stab in the back.

553
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,800
<i>This is how I deal with stress.</i>

554
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:06,867
Here we go.

555
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,467
Yes, she's gonna help you.

556
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:15,468
Can you take care
of this lady? Thank you.

557
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,368
Hey, it's Chuck.
Leave a message.

558
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:27,567
Hi. Uh, I don't know if you got
any of my other messages, Chuck.

559
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,067
I don't know.
It's just kind of helping me

560
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:32,034
to talk them out
over the machine.

561
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,633
I can't really talk
to Devon about anything.

562
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,433
He's, like, born to be here.

563
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,833
The villagers love him.

564
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:39,233
They have this nickname for him.

565
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,866
We can't really pronounce it
in Bantu,

566
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,066
but it loosely translates

567
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:44,667
to "Dr. Super Fantastic
White Person."

568
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,567
I'm just tired.

569
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,567
I'm just tired,
and I'll feel better

570
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,966
when I get some sleep.

571
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:54,334
Okay, I love you and I miss you.

572
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:56,700
I'll talk to you soon.

573
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:59,966
Ellie.
Yeah?

574
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,266
How are you?

575
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,633
Great. You know, if
you ever need to talk,

576
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,733
you can always come to me.

577
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,799
It's just one of my jobs.

578
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,334
I'm fine. I'm fine.

579
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:10,899
Good.

580
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,834
Mm, I'm not fine.

581
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,134
Huh. I-I have
a little brother,

582
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:19,067
and, uh, we used to camp out
in our backyard.

583
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,833
I would, I would pitch a tent

584
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,133
and make s'mores,
the whole thing.

585
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:23,400
He'd fall asleep,

586
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:25,266
and I'd sneak back inside
and set the alarm

587
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,867
for the morning and get in there
before he could wake up.

588
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:32,434
I just... Justin,
I'm not built for this.

589
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,699
That's not true.

590
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,333
I've seen you
with your patients, Ellie.

591
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:38,334
<i>You are built for
being a doctor here.</i>

592
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:41,967
Now, it might take time to get
used to the other stuff, but...

593
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:43,934
It's worth it.

594
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,667
Thank you, Justin.

595
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,532
Welcome.

596
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,934
<i>Mmm!</i>

597
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,766
I can get used to this.

598
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,333
You will, darling,

599
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:02,267
as soon as we make the sale.

600
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:05,167
30 years, we always
did what's right.

601
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,767
I keep thinking of those
poor, young agents.

602
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,632
What a pair of saps.

603
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,433
Reminded me of us.

604
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,867
I just hope we didn't
hurt their career.

605
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:16,368
They never had a career,
not with the CIA.

606
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:18,834
You saw how they looked
at each other.

607
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,201
They're obviously in love.

608
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:23,201
And we're not?

609
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:25,468
Oh, no, no, we're still in love.

610
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:28,034
<i>A different sort
of love.</i>

611
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,001
It's just more like a...
an old bourbon.

612
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,600
So now I'm old?
Aged to perfection, my dear.

613
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,134
How about that little piece
of jailbait at the party?

614
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,234
Was that you trying to
cork a younger vintage?

615
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:40,234
I see where you're going
with the metaphor.

616
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:42,967
No, she was just part
of the mission; a diversion.

617
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,734
How many times have I heard that
excuse, you lecherous old...?!

618
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,900
She was planning on having breast
enhancement surgery, and she asked my advice.

619
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,532
You'd like to give her
an operation, wouldn't you?

620
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,934
She was obviously in awe of me,
if not in love.

621
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,101
Room service!

622
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:56,700
Go ahead and leave it.

623
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,934
All clear.

624
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:13,067
"Compliments
of the Bartowski's."

625
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,368
Darling, do we know
any Bartowski...?

626
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,134
How did you ever find us?

627
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,600
You're the only room
that ordered 12 Manhattans.

628
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,900
We learned from the best.

629
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,900
You don't know what
that weapon is, do you?

630
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,599
What? Are you kidding me?

631
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,867
Sig 229 nine millimeter,
13-round magazine.

632
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:36,666
Laser grip,
full metal jacket, sir.

633
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,867
Impressive.

634
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,766
Yeah, well, I play a lot
of first-person shooters.

635
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:43,067
Well, this isn't a video game.

636
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:45,267
Hey, whoa-whoa.

637
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:47,234
Thank you.

638
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,599
All right.

639
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,767
Here we go. No problem.

640
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:51,966
Morgan, you got this.

641
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:53,133
<i>Just like Call of Duty.</i>

642
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:55,468
Squeeze the trigger...

643
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,533
Oh!

644
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,367
Holy cow!
I think your gun

645
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:00,766
just exploded in my hand!

646
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,532
Sit down! There's nothing wrong
with the gun.

647
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,200
Hmm?
Sit down!

648
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,734
No, I-I think should...
Sit!

649
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,700
Yes, sir.

650
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,734
You're firing me, aren't you?

651
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,233
Oh, my God, this is even

652
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,234
worse than when I got canned
from Underpants, Etc.

653
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,900
It's not the end of the world.

654
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,401
Oh, come on! That's what you all
say when you fire me.

655
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:22,499
I blew it.

656
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,434
I blew my one chance
to be a spy,

657
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,833
and the thing is, Casey,

658
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,699
all I wanted to do
was be a part of this team.

659
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,934
Know how you feel.

660
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,766
You know, Morgan,
you were there for me

661
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:34,467
when I was out on my ass
with the agency.

662
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:37,934
I just want you to know
I'm here for you now.

663
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,901
Really?

664
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:43,667
Not just like spy or work
or Buy More,

665
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:45,634
you mean like a friend.

666
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,834
Let's just keep that
on the down low, huh?

667
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:52,101
Done. Shh. But I need
you to know something.

668
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,067
I've been canned
from a lot of places.

669
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:57,034
By a lot of people,
and... you were the best, sir.

670
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,733
Whew!

671
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:04,001
Let's not let ourselves
get carried away here, Charles.

672
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,499
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Turner.

673
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,933
Is that what you think,

674
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:08,566
that I'm getting carried away?
How did you think

675
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,500
we would react
after what you did?

676
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,667
What have we really done
at this point, Sarah?

677
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,934
We didn't sell Otto's software,

678
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,666
so technically,
we're not yet traitors.

679
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,666
Am I correct?

680
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,333
It was his idea to steal it.

681
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:21,834
He forced me to act
like a drunk at the party.

682
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,667
I only wish his lecherous
Lothario routine was an act.

683
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:27,301
She's lying! I wanted
to bring the software back.

684
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,567
It was her idea to sell it
on the black market.

685
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,367
Oh, no, no,
you can't lie to the...

686
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:32,632
You can lie to me.

687
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,100
Your duplicity amazes me.

688
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:35,899
Quiet!

689
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,468
Enough, okay?

690
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,468
It is one thing to
betray your agency,

691
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:42,533
it is another to
betray your partner.

692
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
You were supposed

693
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,400
to come here and teach us.

694
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,533
Teach us how to be
a great spy couple.

695
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:55,201
You really think we're that bad?

696
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:57,368
Only because you were
once great, yeah.

697
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,166
<i>We were great,</i>

698
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,767
remember?

699
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,767
Check back with me
in 30 years, Charles.

700
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:08,900
The CIA has a way
of breaking young idealists.

701
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:11,267
Especially if they're in love.

702
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:19,434
Good, the marshals are here.

703
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,067
It's Otto!

704
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:34,633
And his pussycat.

705
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:47,033
How, how did your good friend
Otto find us?

706
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,734
Did you two sell us out again?

707
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,167
The collar has
a tracking device.

708
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,434
All right, where do you keep
your backup guns?

709
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,032
Surely, you've heard

710
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:58,067
of the 30-foot rule, Charles.

711
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:03,067
Time to flash, time to flash.

712
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:07,200
No guns, no flash.

713
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,701
Honey, darling, would you mind
telling me what you've done

714
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,868
with our small cache of weapons?
I got rid of them, sweetheart.

715
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:14,967
You actually listened to me? I
can't quite believe it myself.

716
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,467
What have you done with the gun that you
had at the hotel? I left them in the car.

717
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,601
Why would you...?
Because you told me to!

718
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,567
Rookies. You take care of them

719
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:23,501
I'll take care of Otto.

720
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,234
You're making a big mistake.

721
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,267
Hi, how you doing?

722
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:32,234
Good Lord!

723
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,467
Sorry to drop in on you
like this.

724
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,134
Sasha always feels at home
wherever she goes.

725
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,267
You don't mind
if she looks around?

726
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,467
What, uh,
what-what-what's going on?

727
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:48,400
Uh, who are you people?

728
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:50,199
You know exactly who I am.

729
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,100
The question is, who are you?

730
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:55,167
Wait a minute. You're the guy!

731
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:58,033
Baby, this is the guy with
the mansion up in the hills!

732
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, oh, I told you
this would happen.

733
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:02,501
I'm so sorry. My boyfriend
thinks that it's really funny

734
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,400
to crash rich people's parties.

735
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,966
Where are the two

736
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,533
CIA agents you're hiding?

737
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:08,633
I'm sorry. What?

738
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,032
I believe you know them

739
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,533
as Mr. and Mrs. Turner.

740
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:14,267
I'm a, I'm a little
confused here.

741
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,601
Why would CIA agents be
in our apartment?

742
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,601
Because this isn't
a real apartment.

743
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,868
This is a CIA safe house.

744
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:24,667
And you two
are not a real couple.

745
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,099
You are spies.

746
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,501
Ah!

747
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,634
I'm on to you.

748
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:31,700
This is a practical joke,
isn't it?

749
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,700
I bet this is from your brother.

750
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,366
Okay, oh...

751
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:35,767
You're a spy, honey.
We're spies.

752
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:37,233
Scary spies.
You know what?

753
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:38,932
I've always felt like
I've got a James Bond-y thing

754
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:40,833
going on about me.
You do. You could be,

755
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:42,099
like, uh, Octopussy
or something like that.

756
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,133
Oh, yeah.

757
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:44,266
Now you're being
really insulting.

758
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:46,834
Listen, whoever you are,

759
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,334
all I ask is

760
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,299
that you hand over the Turners.

761
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,334
You have until the count

762
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:54,600
<i>of drei.</i>

763
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:57,334
<i>Eins, zwei...</i>

764
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:00,033
Stop. Please stop
with the countdown.

765
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,667
Ah, if I could just have a brief
sidebar with my girlfriend,

766
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:04,634
that would be great.

767
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,932
Good. Thanks.

768
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:10,501
These guys really
take it seriously.

769
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,734
This is very good,
though. Very real.

770
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,299
I say we hand them
over. We can't do that.

771
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,633
Why not? They
sold us out.

772
00:33:15,634 --> 00:33:17,299
Because then we'd be
no better than the Turners.

773
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,966
Well, maybe they're right.
Maybe we're going to

774
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,633
end up just like them-
a couple of traitors.

775
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,534
Do you really believe that?

776
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:28,467
No.

777
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,933
I'm sorry, sir. Uh,
but I-I really...

778
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,933
I don't, I don't think
we can help you.

779
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

780
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,032
Guard them.

781
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,099
Uh, yeah, I don't think

782
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,801
that kitty litter
box is big enough.

783
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:48,433
Good girl, Sasha.

784
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:50,334
Take her outside.

785
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:01,034
Sure you're all right?
Yeah.

786
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,800
Espionage wasn't
my only aspiration.

787
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:04,500
I mean, I could always join
the competitive eating circuit.

788
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,634
Well, dare to dream.

789
00:34:15,134 --> 00:34:16,566
<i>The Turners are very clever.</i>

790
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,299
It appears your guests
left in a hurry.

791
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,066
This is unbelievable.

792
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,300
The Turners have left us
holding the bag again?

793
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:25,334
I can assure you,
this will be the last time.

794
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Otto.

795
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,366
Hold on a second.
Clearly,

796
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,367
The Turners have betrayed us
both; that means that we're all

797
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:32,266
on the same side here,
so put your guns down

798
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:35,033
and let us help you hunt down
those backstabbing bastards.

799
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,199
They're the lowest
of the low, okay?

800
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,299
CIA scum.

801
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,334
Let them go, Otto.

802
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:43,367
But they're not
without their moments.

803
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:45,900
What the hell is this?

804
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,167
Wh-What is it,
Casey? What?

805
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:54,032
Shh!

806
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:55,566
It's a Bengal tiger.

807
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:56,932
Female.

808
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:58,834
Fully grown.

809
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,800
Avoid eye contact.

810
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,534
If she charges,

811
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,366
make yourself
as big as possible.

812
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,800
Easy for you to say.

813
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:08,466
It's us you want.

814
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:09,666
We've got the software.

815
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,567
What are you two doing?

816
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,601
Showing you we're not traitors,
Charles.

817
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,701
What should we do?

818
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:17,566
Shh! You're gonna
get us killed.

819
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,467
No.

820
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:24,801
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Just hear me out. Hear me out.

821
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,666
This country needs men
like you, Casey.

822
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,100
Okay? What do I do?

823
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,467
I sell refrigerators, you know?
I mean, if I die, what?

824
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:32,800
They'll shop at Large Mart.
Big deal.

825
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:35,267
But there is a way I
can serve my country.

826
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:39,100
What are you doing? I'm luring the
tiger into Ellie and Awesome's apartment.

827
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,267
You're not. Yes, I am,
and listen to me. No matter

828
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:43,032
what you hear in there,
promise me you will not

829
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:44,133
go in there after me.

830
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:46,234
Semper fi-dizzle.

831
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,567
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.

832
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,734
Sasha.

833
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:24,601
Oh! Okay.

834
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,868
Did you see that? Told you
I was good for something.

835
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,833
Yeah. Move.

836
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,933
We have to bring you in.

837
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,867
You know I can't let you go.

838
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:35,099
That's funny.

839
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,899
I would have said
the same thing 30 years ago.

840
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,032
After what we did?

841
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,967
You would have shot us dead
where we stand.

842
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,501
Which would be perfectly
justifiable.

843
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:48,800
And yet unnecessary.

844
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:50,533
Wouldn't you agree, Sarah?

845
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:53,000
They did save us.

846
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,967
Sorry, darling.

847
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:03,534
It's over.

848
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:18,766
Good work, Team.

849
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:20,834
Our cryptographers
are analyzing Otto's software

850
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,233
as we speak.

851
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,100
Thanks to you, our nation's

852
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:26,368
communications network
remains secure.

853
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:27,599
Thank you, General.

854
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,599
And now,

855
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,700
on to the subject
of the Turners

856
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:32,433
and their actions.

857
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:34,066
Actually, General, if I might
be able to say something

858
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,100
on behalf of the Turners...

859
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,001
General.
No, Sarah. I think I...

860
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:39,301
No, Chuck. It's
okay. I got it.

861
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:41,567
The Turner's double-cross was
actually a triple-cross.

862
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,532
By stealing the software
from us,

863
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,367
they were able to
lure Otto into a trap,

864
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:46,532
and we were able
to capture him.

865
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,767
It was a daring
bit of spycraft.

866
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,734
I would expect nothing
less from the Turners.

867
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,734
I just hope you
and Agent Bartowski

868
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,400
were able to learn something

869
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:56,733
from these
two exemplary operatives.

870
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,001
As a matter of fact, General,

871
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,233
yes, working with the Turners

872
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:04,267
was... quite humbling.

873
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:06,633
You must be ready to move on
to your next assignment.

874
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,934
Thanks but no thanks, General.

875
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:10,467
E- Excuse me?

876
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:12,367
No more assignments.

877
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:14,800
What my husband means to say

878
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,632
is, we're retiring.

879
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,800
But you can't just walk away.

880
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:19,933
You are the best of the best.

881
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:23,167
Who will possibly
take your place?

882
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,033
You...

883
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,666
Are you sure? Really?

884
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,834
I mean, thank you.

885
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,001
* *

886
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:36,001
Watch each other's
backs, you two.

887
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,667
And I wish you
many happy marriages.

888
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,201
* *

889
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:16,666
Please tell me that
Chuck is joking

890
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,066
about them sending
me to boot camp.

891
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,233
'Cause, oh, man.

892
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,433
They're gonna make
me shave my beard.

893
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:21,566
Hmm. Relax.

894
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,666
You passed.

895
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:24,467
Huh?
I failed every test.

896
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:25,966
With flying colors.

897
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:28,468
You have got to be
hands down, bar none

898
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,333
the worst candidate
I've ever trained.

899
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,368
But you've got one thing
going for you.

900
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:35,100
You got balls.

901
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:37,334
I do?

902
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,966
How many Marines
you know would go

903
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:40,867
up against a Bengal
tiger unarmed? Yeah.

904
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,733
You'd have to be
a complete idiot.

905
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:43,933
Well, that's the thing.
You know...

906
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,434
That's, that's me
in a nutshell.

907
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,867
Lesser men, they'd run away
from danger, and I'm, uh..

908
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,901
Casey?

909
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,233
Dude.

910
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,134
You turned my
sister's apartment

911
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,234
into a kitty litter box.

912
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:07,599
I know.
I'm sorry, man.

913
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,799
I just... How was
I supposed to know

914
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,700
the tiger wasn't housebroken?

915
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:13,933
Oh, my God.

916
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,133
Great. You're here.

917
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:16,467
Guys, we got to get
this place fixed up

918
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:17,766
before Devon
and Ellie get back.

919
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,066
Well, actually,

920
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:20,967
<i>I was gonna start
with our place.</i>

921
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:24,899
<i>Our place?</i>

922
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,167
That is, if your offer for
me to move in still stands?

923
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:31,134
Yeah.

924
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,532
I'm sorry that I freaked out

925
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:35,833
when you asked me
to move in with you.

926
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,867
It's just, you know
how I grew up.

927
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,900
I spent my life living in
hotel rooms under fake names.

928
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:42,766
I've been trained to survive

929
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,333
a thousand different
situations in the field,

930
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:47,600
but nobody ever taught me
how to have a normal life.

931
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:50,368
Well, I hate to break it
to you, but I don't think

932
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:52,500
we're ever going
to live a normal life.

933
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,267
Well, I'd like to have
something to fall back on

934
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:57,633
when our spy life is over.

935
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:06,600
Devon, sweetie, where are you?

936
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,468
Devon?

937
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,433
Baby?

938
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:16,267
Ah, baby, you're burning up.

939
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,533
I'll be right back.
Help!

940
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:24,799
Sorry, El.

941
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,666
I thought we could do
some good work here.

942
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,833
You do not apologize.

943
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,734
Now it's my job
to take care of you, okay?

944
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:33,866
Thank you.

945
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,233
I alerted the airport.

946
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:36,566
There's an ambulance
waiting for you,

947
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:38,300
so you can skip customs
and drive straight

948
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:40,100
onto the tarmac.
Thank you.

949
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,733
Your husband's
going to be fine.

950
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:43,634
I know, I know.

951
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,368
I just can't believe
we're leaving so soon.

952
00:41:46,434 --> 00:41:48,266
There are plenty of ways
you can help back home.

953
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:49,599
Take care.

954
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
All right. Feel better.

955
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,066
They just left.

956
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,034
I took care of the husband.

957
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,468
Made it look like malaria.

958
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,433
She doesn't suspect a thing.
