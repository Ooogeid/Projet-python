1
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,105
- Get up!
- I'm actually good down here.

2
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,191
Grow up, Morgan Grimes!

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,123
You were spying on me in gym class.

4
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:29,320
- I'm going to kick your...
- Help!

5
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,286
Don't worry, Morgan.
I got your back.

6
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,331
Suzy, I'll take it from here.

7
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:43,628
Morgan, maybe you should
stay away from girls,

8
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:45,651
for, like, 15 years?

9
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:48,974
All right, check it out.

10
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,553
A picture of your ex-girlfriend?
That...

11
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:55,262
that's why I had to come
in here on my coffee break?

12
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:57,433
Anna Melinda Wu.

13
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,226
Five - two, 96 pounds,
of Chinese descent.

14
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,729
Why-why... why are we in here
talking about your ex?

15
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:05,994
Because today, I need your help

16
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,108
on a mission.

17
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,567
What kind of mission?

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,047
- A spy mission, Charles.
- Can you handle it?

19
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:14,281
You see, I'm afraid
Anna may be seeing a new guy.

20
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,908
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, time out.

21
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,316
- You want me to spy on Anna?
- Course not, Chuck.

22
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,907
You'd be there for moral support.
You're not skilled in spy-craft.

23
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:22,745
No, that's where
Lester and Jeff come in.

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,710
Does it shock you that 80%
of my encounters with women

25
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,582
have been completely
without their knowledge?

26
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,561
Honestly, I'm more surprised
by the other 20%, Jeff.

27
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:33,782
Look, buddy, I know you're going
through a tough time,

28
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:36,437
but I just don't feel comfortable
stalking another human being.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,216
Dude, it's not stalking, okay?

30
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,037
It's caring enough about someone

31
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:42,350
to learn things about them
they won't tell you themselves.

32
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:43,540
Which is stalking.

33
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:46,076
And I really need
you on this one, so...

34
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:50,956
Please, Devon, I really need you.

35
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,779
Only got a couple minutes before
I got to get to work, but if

36
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:57,407
you don't mind a little drive-thru
when you're used to fine dining...

37
00:01:57,532 --> 00:01:59,515
No. No, no, no.
No. Not-not for that. I just...

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,115
I need your help.
This is our to-do list for our wedding.

39
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,566
Ooh. Less fun.

40
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,292
There's just not enough hours in
the day for me to do everything myself,

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,628
plus work night shifts, and plus be a
sister and a friend and a girlfriend...

42
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,588
Fiancée.

43
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,341
My point is, is that I need you to start
pulling your weight around here, okay?

44
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,094
So you can deal with the flowers,

45
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,637
the music and the cake.

46
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,890
- I will handle the rest.
- Babe. Babe.

47
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,098
A marriage is a partnership.

48
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:25,853
A wedding should be, too.

49
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:27,624
Okay.

50
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:43,891
What is this place?

51
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,414
Whatever our friend Jeffery here
doesn't guzzle down his throat,

52
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,252
he spends on spy gear.
Incredible, right?

53
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,710
Incredibly creepy.

54
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:52,358
Hey, ladies, let's go.
Man your posts.

55
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,423
Babysitting the freak show.

56
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:04,934
This should be enlightening.

57
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,610
Ah, we have visual acquisition
of the target.

58
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,195
We got ears on.

59
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:21,242
Subject is on the move.

60
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,908
Guys. Guys, we can't do this.

61
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,713
We shouldn't be doing this right now.
I mean, we're, like crazy stalkers.

62
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,164
Shh! Charles, please!

63
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,790
What the hell are these crazy
stalkers up to?

64
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,573
Looks like some
pretty decent spy work.

65
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:57,497
Would you just stop and think
about what you're doing for a second?

66
00:03:57,622 --> 00:04:00,009
I know exactly what I'm doing, brother.
I'm getting answers, man.

67
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:01,782
But there are other ways
of doing that.

68
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,803
No. Absolutely. We tried cloning Anna's
cell, but she's got a CDMA carrier,

69
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,579
so we couldn't copy the SIM card.

70
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:10,576
Wait, wait, wait,.

71
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:12,666
Here. There's a guy.
There's a guy just showed up.

72
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,334
Quick. Let me see.
Let me see.

73
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:15,646
Ooh.

74
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:18,659
Maybe it's her brother.

75
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:23,888
Still,

76
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,377
could be her brother.

77
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:27,276
All right. Let's back it up.
Abort mission.

78
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,255
I mean, I can't compete
with this guy, Chuck.

79
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,229
He's got healthy hair,
a clean smile and a killer car.

80
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,239
Look at him.

81
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:43,555
I mean,

82
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,614
he's my worst nightmare!

83
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,387
Yeah. I'd trust your instincts, pal.

84
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,566
Uh, the general will be available

85
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,354
to talk about the Jason Wang
situation momentarily.

86
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,509
Hey, how come you guys have these
in here anyway? I mean, do you play?

87
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:59,460
They're not toys, Chuck.
If you pop the top,

88
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:02,296
they are white phosphorous grenades.
They can melt iron.

89
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:03,385
Okeydokey.

90
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:05,930
What are these, mini flamethrowers?

91
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,132
Uh. Mint-flavored knockout spray.

92
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:11,701
Oh! Really? Do you think
I can have one of these?

93
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:14,563
'Cause I'm always, you know,
really vulnerable out there.

94
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:17,526
Jason Wang, Anna Wu's new boyfriend.

95
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,405
Wang's a car importer,
and while he has no criminal record,

96
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,072
he runs with a dangerous crew
of local Triad gangsters.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,230
A gang responsible
for smuggling guns,

98
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:27,328
drugs and other weapons
in and out of Los Angeles.

99
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,840
Correct, Agent Walker.

100
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,881
We've been watching
the local Triad for a while,

101
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:33,496
but didn't know about Wang's
involvement before Chuck's flash.

102
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:34,910
Well, you're welcome.

103
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:38,658
You really don't have to thank me.
Not-not that you are thanking me.

104
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:41,151
I guess you're really just kind of
making a statement. Continue.

105
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:44,176
Your mission is to determine the depth
of Wang's connection to Triad.

106
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:47,554
Chuck, use your social connection
to infiltrate the suspect.

107
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,724
Um, excuse me, General,

108
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,404
but just-just to clarify...

109
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,813
you want me to befriend my best friend's
ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend?

110
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,273
Is there a problem, Mr. Bartowski?

111
00:05:58,781 --> 00:05:59,922
No. Nope.

112
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:01,848
No. Not a...

113
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:03,404
Not a problem.

114
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,994
I got a big problem here.

115

119
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,714
Sleep well last night, Chuck?

120
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:02,974
What?

121
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,509
Actually, no.
I was having...

122
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,222
nightmares about
people spying on me,

123
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,411
Which-which... which
now feels all too real.

124
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:16,183
My point was that while
you were still here asleep,

125
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:18,062
I'm just now getting home from work.

126
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,191
Tough night. Saving lives
can get pretty gnarly sometimes.

127
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:24,515
Tell me about it.

128
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:27,154
So, what are your plans for today?

129
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,240
Uh, well, you know, I mean,
I-I probably have to go to work.

130
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,575
You know?

131
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,453
And, uh, I-I might get a pizza
with Sarah afterwards

132
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,856
- or something, you know?
- Cakewalk, huh?

133
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,461
Considering your mellow skedge,

134
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,635
what do you say, you help out
your soon-to-be brother-in-law?

135
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:45,172
What'd you have in mind?

136
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,247
Ellie wants me to find a band
for the wedding,

137
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:49,051
and I know how much you love music,

138
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:50,955
and how busy I am.

139
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,390
So, I was thinking, this could be
a win-win situation for both of us.

140
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:57,893
You want <i>me</i> to find a
band for your wedding?

141
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,934
That'd be awesome, dude.

142
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,310
Thanks a lot.

143
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,395
<i>I can't do this.</i>

144
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,294
How can the General ask me
to do this?

145
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,535
I mean, was the woman born
with stars on her shoulders?

146
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,479
Has she never <i>had</i> a friend before?
I can't just go and hang out

147
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,535
with my best friend's ex and her
new boyfriend like it's no big deal!

148
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,663
I understand that this may be difficult
for you with regard to Morgan...

149
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,685
No. No, no, no, no.
No, not difficult.

150
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,251
Not happening! Morgan has been
my best friend since kindergarten.

151
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,368
I don't even know what
he would do if he found out.

152
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:27,005
I'm sorry, Chuck, but this is
not an optional. It's a direct order.

153
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,591
I can't betray my best friend!
How come nobody gets that?!

154
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:31,552
Semper Fidelis.

155
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,504
It means, "always faithful"
in the Marines.

156
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,840
In civilian life, it means putting your
friend's well-being above your own, huh?

157
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,006
I salute you for that, Bartowski.

158
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:41,979
Well done.

159
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,357
Yeah. That's...

160
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,566
Thanks, Casey. Yeah,
Semper Fi. Semper Fi.

161
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,985
You know, it's a pretty upside
down world when this guy's

162
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,554
the one picking up on the
emotional nuances around here.

163
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:53,096
All right,
let's go tell the General.

164
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,187
Yeah, but as much as I respect
your Code of Honor,

165
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:58,287
there's nothing I can do about it.
Orders before honor this time, Bartowski.

166
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,935
Go befriend Anna's new boyfriend.

167
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,539
So, um, how would you...

168
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:10,644
How would you categorize your music?

169
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,719
I me, who-who are kind of
your more major influences?

170
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:19,516
You know, I'm actually not familiar
with your Uncle Max's klezmer band.

171
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,268
So, thank you anyway.

172
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,393
- What was that about?
- I'm helping Ellie and awesome

173
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:27,363
find a band for their wedding.

174
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:30,657
Then this, sir,

175
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:32,362
is your lucky day.

176
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,220
We'll handle it from here.

177
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,118
- You're going to help me find a band?
- Oh, no, no, you misunderstand.

178
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,641
You've found your band.
It is we.

179
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,997
We'll play your sister's big day.

180
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,543
Um, wait. Wait a minute.
You guys have a band?

181
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,892
- Jeff.
- Lester...

182
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:51,984
- Jeffster!
- Jeffster!

183
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:53,427
That seems very fitting.

184
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,888
Originally, we were going
to go with the name Jester,

185
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,310
but we didn't want people to associate
us with a couple of fools.

186
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:00,807
Obviously not.

187
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,741
So, what'd you do last night?

188
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,217
Went out.

189
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:05,283
Mm-hmm.

190
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:06,886
Where'd you go?

191
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,203
Please. I'm with a customer.

192
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,944
I mean, did you go by yourself?

193
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:12,945
Um...

194
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,490
Yeah, my sister her taste runs
a little more classic.

195
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,228
But you haven't heard us.

196
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:20,285
Charles, I'd hate to think
you'd prejudge us.

197
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,988
Don't be a musical bigot.

198
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,530
Um, I'm sorry, but the answer's no.

199
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,960
It just is no.
It's a flat-out no. I'm sorry.

200
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,925
I'm seeing someone, okay, Morgan?

201
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,845
Well, well, well.
The truth comes out.

202
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:40,338
A new man, or...

203
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:43,199
or am I assuming something here?
I mean, it is a man, right?

204
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:45,602
Because we all know about
your very, very colorful past.

205
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,666
- God, grow up, Morgan.
- Oh, please.

206
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,345
Hey. Hey, buddy.
There are some customers over in

207
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,381
refrigerators that might
need some helping.

208
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:55,512
All right, I clocked out a couple hours
ago, so I'm on my own time here.

209
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:57,679
Enough... buddy.

210
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:59,283
You should probably go.

211
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,470
All right, well,

212
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:06,545
I-I hope you and your new boyfriend
are very unhappy together.

213
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,951
I'm sorry about Morgan.

214
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,508
You've spent your whole
life apologizing for him.

215
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,467
Don't you get it?
He's never going to grow up.

216
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,140
There's a million reasons
to love him,

217
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:23,092
but unfortunately
maturity is not on that list.

218
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:27,488
So I hear... I heard

219
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:30,531
that you have a new guy,
new boyfriend...

220
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,654
or whatever.

221
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,221
Jason's great,

222
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,351
plus an evening out doesn't
involve me on his handlebars

223
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:39,043
- and the Taco Bell drive-thru.
- Know what you mean.

224
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:41,199
I've been riding
on those handlebars for years.

225
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:50,403
Hey, how would you like to go on
a double date or something sometime?

226
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:52,938
- Really?
- Yeah.

227
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:55,871
Jason's having a party
tonight at his showroom.

228
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,991
I mean, only thing more expensive
than the champagne will be the cars.

229
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,330
- You and Sarah should stop by.
- Sounds great.

230
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,947
Yeah, can't wait to meet
your new boyfriend.

231
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:04,870
Okay.

232
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:06,016
Wow.

233
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:07,601
Good job.

234
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:08,976
I hate you.

235
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,707
I can't believe I have
to meet her new boyfriend.

236
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:14,217
Chuck and I will enter
as our cover couple,

237
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:15,529
get close to Wang...

238
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,819
See if the skin-covered robot
flashes on anything...

239
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,169
What, is that supposed to be me?
That's real nice.

240
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:22,370
Figure out any connection
Wang has to the Triad...

241
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:23,950
Try to plant this GLG-20.

242
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,511
I'll be in the van monitoring
your activity. All set? Let's go.

243
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:28,547
Actually, you know what?
I-I've been thinking.

244
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:31,249
- Stop that.
- If our mission is to betray Morgan,

245
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,960
I think we should have
a second mission:

246
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:35,010
To convince Anna of what
she's missing without him.

247
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:37,638
- Only one mission here, moron.
- Oh, "moron," that's...

248
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:40,014
You know, sticks and stones
may break my bones...

249
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,993
Do you want me to test
that theory, Bartowski?

250
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:43,503
- Not particularly.
- No.

251
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:45,651
Ha.

252
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:03,679
So, uh, Anna, w-what's
the occasion for all this?

253
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:06,953
It's a car preview for an auction
Jason's having tomorrow...

254
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,847
sort of an open house for cars.

255
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:12,857
Anna, these, these cars are
almost the price of a house.

256
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:15,120
Your boyfriend must be
very successful.

257
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,546
Although the, the true measure
of a man's success

258
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,111
is not in dollars but rather
his ability to love,

259
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:24,126
and if that's true,
Morgan is stinking rich.

260
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,346
I mean, wouldn't you agree, Sarah?

261
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,348
I do miss you guys together.

262
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,225
- You do?
- I'm sure

263
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,020
Jason's a great guy, but...

264
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,521
I'll always think of you and
Morgan as the perfect couple.

265
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,148
And she'd say it all the time,

266
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,758
"cute couple alert: Here
comes Morgan and Anna."

267
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,400
Cut the infomercial
on the bearded loser.

268
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:42,948
Wang just walked in.

269
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,534
That is so strange.

270
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,566
What-what's strange?
That I was touching my ear?

271
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:52,919
That's... no, that's eczema,
which is totally normal, not strange.

272
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:55,298
- People have it.
- No, strange Sarah even thought

273
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,326
about Morgan and I as a couple.

274
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,881
To be honest, I didn't think you ever
really noticed me much.

275
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,261
That's not true, Anna.

276
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,553
I have always thought of you
as a friend.

277
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:06,805
Honey,

278
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,181
- Can you come here?
- Excuse me.

279
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,974
Jason, this is Sarah and Chuck.

280
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,519
They're my friends.

281
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,354
- Well, any friend of Anna's...
- Hi.

282
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,355
Even though this is our, our first
time meeting, I feel as though I know

283
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,568
every teeny, tiny,
little thing about you.

284
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:23,466
All good, I hope.

285
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:26,573
Hello, douche bag.

286
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,606
Okay, okay.

287
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:31,870
What do we got here?

288
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,624
No, it can't be.

289
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:40,203
Judas.

290
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:51,019
Nerd herd desk. Download me
on your computer emergency.

291
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:54,032
Hi, hi, uh, this is Ellie Bartowski.
Is my brother around?

292
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:57,009
Devon and I were in the middle
of our guest list and the computer...

293
00:14:57,134 --> 00:14:59,877
- froze.
- Uh, hey, Ellie, uh,

294
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,141
I think Chuck is out
on an install right now.

295
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,022
I'll leave him a message.
Okay.

296
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:07,447
Uh, we'll be right over to fix it.

297
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,981
Oh, thank you,
thank you, that's great.

298
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:13,370
Wow, it finally pays to have
a brother in mediocre places.

299
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,493
Um, Jefferson?

300
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,958
Dude, you almost blew
our big chance.

301
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:21,211
We're going over there to audition.

302
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,095
What do you mean?
Like, right now?

303
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,340
Come on, man.

304
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:29,233
If you had one shot, one opportunity

305
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:32,031
to seize everything you ever wanted,

306
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:33,435
one moment,

307
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,021
would you capture it
or just let it slip?

308
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,524
Jeffster! Lives, man.

309
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,502
Yes.

310
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:51,450
Great, fantastic.

311
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,848
I just flashed.

312
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,487
Her name is Smooth Lau,
and they're all Triad.

313
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,474
Okay, let's follow them.

314
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,121
Hey, um, can I talk to you?

315
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,483
I could really use a friend
right now.

316
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:26,906
Oh, sure.

317
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,453
- I'll catch up in a second, sweetie.
- Okay.

318
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,836
Wait for me.

319
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,332
- Yeah.
- Thanks, chuckles.

320
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:35,493
I'm all ears.

321
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:38,288
Rebooted it and ran a disk utility.

322
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,326
It's as good
as a non-new computer can be.

323
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:41,793
Oh, thank God.

324
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,551
The woman can replace
an aortic valve,

325
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:46,046
but a frozen computer screen
makes her panic.

326
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,012
Uh, excuse me.

327
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,135
Why are you touching my things?

328
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,929
I'm setting up to rock you hard.

329
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,724
Uh, rock <i>who</i> hard?

330
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,184
Our audition.

331
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,172
Jeffster! Is going to play
the biggest gig of your life:

332
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,357
your wedding day.

333
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:08,453
Is he drunk?

334
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,825
You didn't really set them up
to audition, did you?

335
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,851
Of course not.
Chuck must have.

336
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:14,991
Sibilance.
Check.

337
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,336
Wait a minute, did you outsource
your to-do list?

338
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:18,161
No...

339
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,852
I know how much Chuck loves music.
Thought it'd be fun for him.

340
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:23,772
Oh, you did?
# mah, may, moe, moo #

341
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:26,322
# mah, may, moo # # mah, mee #

342
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:27,412
# mah... #

343
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:30,340
Uh, excuse me, guys, we,
we just have a lot to do.

344
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,567
Oh. Sure, cool, cool,
sure, we're all set.

345
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,135
L-let's, let's do this.

346
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,767
Now or never.

347
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:38,245
Lester: Hang on.
# mah, may, mee, moe #

348
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:40,022
# moo... moo... #

349
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:42,485
This is what we've always
wanted for Jeffster!

350
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:44,939
We start at a small venue like this.

351
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,774
Pretty soon, we're
playing the big time.

352
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,674
Yeah, sure, we're going
to blow their minds, but...

353
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:57,853
where does all this lead?

354
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:01,293
Stadiums, groupies, drugs, creative
differences, and then what?

355
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,934
Jeffster! Breaks up?
That's you and me, Jeff.

356
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,792
And then what's my fate? Some
chambermaid finds me in a hotel room,

357
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,160
having accidentally asphyxiated while
making love to myself?

358
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,505
It's just not worth it!

359
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,138
He's such a tortured artist.

360
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,392
Look, I'm having a
very important party

361
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,642
out there, and we've never
done it this way before.

362
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,966
Yeah, yeah, just give me the keys.

363
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,519
I think I've earned the right
to know what's going on.

364
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:31,331
What's in the container?

365
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,946
You mind your business,
I'll mind mine.

366
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,865
You're getting paid either way.

367
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:42,978
Come on, flash.

368
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:45,443
Flash, damn it.

369
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,961
I can help.

370
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,626
He's probably...

371
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,596
Okay.

372
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,435
Look, this is way too risky.

373
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,979
I'm out after this shipment.

374
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:04,267
Well, if all goes well,
we won't need another.

375
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,897
And what are you worried about?

376
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:09,272
Customs didn't suspect a thing
with that Rolls Royce in the crate.

377
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,257
Where the hell is he?

378
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,338
- The door is jammed.
- I'll go get a crowbar.

379
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,318
Hey, wait.

380
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,657
- Be quiet, I thought I heard something.
- Damn it, Bartowski.

381
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,432
Did you hear that?

382
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,900
I like Jason and,
you know, on paper,

383
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,156
he's everything Morgan's not,
so that's good.

384
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,936
- No, no, that's bad.
- Why?

385
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,533
Because Morgan's the guy
you keep comparing him to.

386
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:08,420
Sarah, you're totally right.

387
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:10,336
Oh, my God.

388
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,919
Do you think
that means I still love him?

389
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:16,344
Attention, security, we found
an intruder on the premises.

390
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:17,298
Chuck.

391
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:28,142
Repeat, we found an intruder
on the premises.

392
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,221
Oh, no.

393
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,196
Casey.

394
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,278
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

395
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,344
If Chuck hasn't been
captured, then...

396
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:42,031
who is the spy
being held by Triad?

397
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:45,660
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Let me explain!

398
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,491
You're going to
damage my Schwinn.

399
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:48,728
They've got Morgan!

400
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:51,499
What?
We've got to help him.

401
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,805
No, Chuck, we cannot just
start pulling out weapons.

402
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:56,588
- We're going to blow our cover.
- Then what's the next option?

403
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,459
You think it's easy
for me to do nothing?

404
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,690
It goes against everything I believe
in to leave a man behind.

405
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,509
Then don't do nothing.
Do something.

406
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,010
We can't just stand here
while my best friend gets

407
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:05,044
tortured or killed.

408
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:10,377
Fine, if you're not going
to save him...

409
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,644
then I will.

410
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,230
Who are you?

411
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:15,855
Nobody.

412
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:16,937
I'm... I'm...

413
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,910
My name is, uh,
Marlamin Stoneheart.

414
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:23,448
I'm a 60th-level
gnome warrior.

415
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,610
The truth.

416
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,669
59th level, you know,
but I'm, like, this close.

417
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:30,988
I found him spying on us.

418
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,649
You've got one second
to tell me why.

419
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:34,841
- One!
- Wait!

420
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:37,076
Wait, he's not a spy!
And who the hell are you?

421
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,963
- Wait, what's going on?
- Morgan?

422
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,548
This is your ex from buy more?

423
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,415
What are you doing here?

424
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,636
Tell me before I break
your neck.

425
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,971
No, don't...
You don't want to do that,

426
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,117
Because I know why he's here.
He's here...

427
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:52,602
Chuck, man...

428
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:56,731
He's here because
he's stalking you.

429
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:57,774
What?

430
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:00,400
That's right, that's right.

431
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:01,401
He's not a spy, okay?

432
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:02,535
He's a stalker,

433
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:06,658
which is a thin, but very,
very key difference,

434
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,219
in my opinion.

435
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:09,798
I see why Anna dumped you.

436
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:14,347
This guy is a profoundly disturbed
individual, okay?

437
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,875
He just can't...
He can't let go of her.

438
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,576
He's an obsessed

439
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,088
but totally unthreatening...

440
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,056
...sicko.

441
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,470
Grow up, Morgan Grimes.

442
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,847
Sicko freak.

443
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,350
Let him go.

444
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:35,914
Let's go.

445
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:44,110
Well, you just saved
your best friend's life.

446
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:46,246
At the expense of his dignity.

447
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,414
Well, at least he's still breathing.

448
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:49,742
Come on.

449
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,176
Look what I just found, boss.

450
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:08,386
Guess that little freak
wasn't just a stalker after all.

451
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:09,804
Kill him.

452
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,796
Hey, buddy, you...
You need some help?

453
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,031
Nope.

454
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:20,103
I got to learn to do things

455
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:22,217
on my own from now on.

456
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,477
Look, Morgan,
I know that I hurt your feelings,

457
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,163
but I was only
trying to protect you.

458
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,067
We've been friends for
a long time, right?

459
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,623
As long as I can remember,
buddy.

460
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,487
Enjoy the memories.

461
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,481
What?
Buddy.

462
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:43,672
You got any idea what Ellie and awesome
thought about Jeffster!?

463
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:48,760
We didn't fully play out, but if you could
put in a good word.

464
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:50,712
Jeff, I don't understand
anything

465
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:53,073
That just came out of your mouth.
The truth is, I don't care.

466
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:55,032
I know that you think
my concerns are no bigger

467
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:57,859
than the weekend weather
or whatever's new in the snack machine,

468
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,687
but I have the weight
of the damn world

469
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,555
on my shoulders,
so if you don't mind,

470
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,608
figure out your own crap.

471
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,236
Good, you're here.
I need you to cross-check

472
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,100
these Customs docs
with the bill of lading

473
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,916
that you saw
on the container yesterday.

474
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,895
How could you just stand there
and make me choose

475
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:17,047
between Morgan's life
and his friendship?

476
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:20,225
That wasn't going to happen
because Anna vouched for him.

477
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:22,416
- You don't get who he is to me.
- No, I get it.

478
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:23,878
He's your best friend.

479
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:26,298
You know, you say that,

480
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,633
but I don't think you
have a clue what it means.

481
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:31,504
Look, Sarah...

482
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:33,346
I don't have parents.

483
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,308
I mean, not really.

484
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,836
And I don't talk about it because

485
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,808
that's just the way
that things are now.

486
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:41,062
But it wasn't always this way.

487
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:44,982
Morgan was there the first day
that my mom took off.

488
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:47,654
He didn't say much
because, honestly,

489
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,403
what is a fifth grader
supposed to say?

490
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,753
But we sat there and split
a cherry cheesecake

491
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:53,852
and played Legend of Zelda
all night long.

492
00:24:54,944 --> 00:24:57,203
And my dad...
Well, that's a whole...

493
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,014
other story, but Morgan
was there for that, too.

494
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,873
Morgan is more
than just my best friend.

495
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,118
He's my family.

496
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:09,253
Before you got here

497
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:14,896
and long after you've gone,
Morgan is my family.

498
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,206
Last night, we failed to learn

499
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,958
the contents of the
Triad's container,

500
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,145
and now we don't know

501
00:25:23,228 --> 00:25:25,533
what kind of drugs or weapons
are floating around in the city.

502
00:25:25,616 --> 00:25:27,752
And while I appreciate
your friendship with Morgan,

503
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:31,696
losing sight of that container
endangers many people's best friends.

504
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:34,240
Not just yours, Chuck.

505
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:46,919
Not a good time, bro.

506
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,929
Dude, you're supposed to
stop a door with your foot.

507
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:53,736
Have you ever had a dream

508
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,937
that's never come true?

509
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,098
No.

510
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,994
Okay.

511
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,035
Have you ever had a best friend

512
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:04,729
with a dream
that's never come true?

513
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,967
Lester was scared
to sing yesterday,

514
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,609
but he has a voice

515
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,631
that makes angels cry.

516
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:15,072
Please, give Jeffster
another chance.

517
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,771
Jeff, you're a weird dude,

518
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:21,221
but I guess even
a weird dude

519
00:26:21,304 --> 00:26:23,369
like you can have a friend.

520
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:25,445
I don't know how I'm
gonna convince Ellie,

521
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:27,210
but you got yourself
another audition.

522
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:28,903
You want me to talk to her?

523
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,224
We have a rapport.

524
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,804
Morgan, will you please,

525
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,400
just talk to me
for one second?

526
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:42,158
I have nothing left
to say to you, dude.

527
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:45,304
One question, though, before,

528
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:47,206
I never speak
to you again.

529
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,958
How did you betraying me
turn into you saving me?

530
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:52,123
I'm sorry for betraying you.

531
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:54,350
No, dude, you don't
get to say sorry.

532
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:55,656
Sorry isn't good enough.

533
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,983
It's a cheap band-aid...

534
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,600
Stop it, dude,
you don't get it.

535
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,275
This whole thing is my fault.

536
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:02,494
Man, it's me.

537
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,372
I made this mess.
You warned me not to spy.

538
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:05,854
I went and did it anyway.

539
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:08,266
I'm so sick of you being right
and then having to bail me out.

540
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:10,403
You've bailed me out
plenty of times.

541
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:12,964
I can't count on you
to fix things my whole life.

542
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,507
Of course you can.

543
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,636
It's time for me to pay
for my own mistakes,

544
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,637
fight my own battles.

545
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:25,740
Um, buddy,

546
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:27,996
I would maybe start
with a different battle.

547
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,640
Look, just keep it down,
remain calm,

548
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,114
and this will all be over soon.

549
00:27:39,197 --> 00:27:40,643
No, dude, you know
what this is?

550
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,355
This is just you
saving me again, man.

551
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:43,543
No, no, it's not.

552
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:47,134
This is two best friends hiding
from a terrible beating.

553
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:48,934
The time is now, okay?

554
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,550
Time for me to stand
up for myself.

555
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,705
I have to go out there to
those beefy, heartless thugs

556
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:54,160
and take it like a grown man.

557
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:56,252
A grown man who spies
on women, fine, but still...

558
00:27:57,227 --> 00:27:58,806
I'm done, Chuck, okay?

559
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:00,695
I won't have you
saving me anymore.

560
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,071
No, wait, wait.

561
00:28:03,154 --> 00:28:04,297
Morgan, wait.

562
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,732
You can't just
go out there with your...

563
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:10,364
- breath stinking like garbage.
- Are you kidding me?

564
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,407
Way to kick a man
when he's about to be beat down.

565
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,093
I'm short and occasionally have dandruff
in my beard.

566
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:15,374
Do you want to riff
on me for that, too?

567
00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:16,555
No, I... I wouldn't...

568
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:18,184
You have dandruff in your beard?

569
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:19,366
I would... No,
all I'm saying is that

570
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,532
maybe you should freshen up
first, you know.

571
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,558
Why poke an already
pissed off bear?

572
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,194
That's strong what is that,
is that just peppermint?

573
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:34,295
That's quick.

574
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:50,061
You seen that stalker from
the party the other night?

575
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:53,074
Yeah, yeah, I think
he actually went out the back.

576
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,723
Talking about getting a slice
or something like that, so...

577
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,196
Take it easy.

578
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:08,730
- What is it?
- Chuck's in trouble. Let's go.

579
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:10,915
So much for my day off.

580
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:15,211
Chuck, I want you
to see something.

581
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,108
No time, I'm actually
right in the middle

582
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:19,628
of moving this very cumbersome
and time-sensitive appliance, so...

583
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:20,927
- Anna
- Come on.

584
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:24,089
Look, my boyfriend's on TV.

585
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:26,085
Antonio Ruiz reporting
from downtown Los Angeles

586
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:28,474
Where I'm standing
with entrepreneur, Jason Wang.

587
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,476
On the auction block today,
a collection

588
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,144
of very fine automobiles...

589
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:40,444
Celebrities and dignitaries
are everywhere

590
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,238
with one thing in common.

591
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:47,941
...a passion for cars.

592
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:49,662
Oh, my God, the auction.

593
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,941
Don't rub it in.
I have to work.

594
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,027
Chuck, what is it?

595
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,955
I just flashed, we have
to get to the auction.

596
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:59,098
Triads are gonna kill
the Chinese Ambassador.

597
00:29:59,181 --> 00:30:01,292
Why would he walk
into a known Triad den?

598
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,848
Wang's got a legitimate business.

599
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,668
The Ambassador doesn't know
Wang's Triad.

600
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,782
It's exactly why it's not
a very safe place for him.

601
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:08,419
We just got to get Morgan.

602
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:13,960
Wait.

603
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,281
Morgan!

604
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:40,584
Stay in the car, Chuck.

605
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,385
How can I stay
in the car when I have

606
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:44,967
to go save Morgan?
- Please, Chuck, just follow orders.

607
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,556
Bartowski, you're like the
poster child for friendly fire.

608
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:19,752
Oh, my God.

609
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,013
It's a bomb.

610
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,938
Ambassador...

611
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:24,840
congratulations on your new rolls.

612
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:25,826
Oh, thank you.

613
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:27,928
It's always been my
dream to own one.

614
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,580
You take care
of last night's problem?

615
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,608
He dead?

616
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:35,947
Not yet.

617
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,205
What do you want us to do with him?

618
00:31:41,703 --> 00:31:42,775
I got a great idea.

619
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:46,495
He can hitch a ride
with the Ambassador.

620
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:50,991
Kill two birds with one bomb.

621
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,239
Hey, listen, listen.

622
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:59,166
Triads implanted a bomb
in the Rolls Royce,

623
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,441
and they put Morgan in the trunk.
We've got to stop it.

624
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:05,297
Stay right where you are.
I'll get the car, you get Chuck.

625
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:24,104
Casey, the container is empty,
and the car has already been dispatched.

626
00:32:24,187 --> 00:32:25,594
Casey, do you copy?

627
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,444
Casey, do you copy?!

628
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:37,672
Pretty girl like you is a cop.

629
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,417
Shame I gotta mess up that face.

630
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,555
Wait! Stop!

631
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,731
Stop, there's a bomb in your car!

632
00:32:56,814 --> 00:32:58,667
It's a Triad trap, move!

633
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,602
No! No...

634
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:05,774
Learn to follow an order, Bartowski!

635
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,430
Let me in!
- I can't!

636
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,697
If I do that, you're not going
to let me save Morgan.

637
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,344
Proving you're not a complete idiot.

638
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:41,685
Let me in!
- Nope! No!

639
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,412
He's my best friend, Casey,
all right?!

640
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,460
It's like you said,
leave no man behind!

641
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:03,678
Okay, tell you what.

642
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:06,168
If you let me in, I promise to
help you save the bearded loser.

643
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,753
You promise?
- I promise.

644
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,131
Semper Fi?
- Semper Fidelis.

645
00:34:27,762 --> 00:34:28,941
What are you doing?

646
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,110
What are you doing?!

647
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,069
You promised that you'd
help me save Morgan.

648
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:34,988
I didn't promise I'd let you drive.

649
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,350
There's a remote control
for this thing?

650
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:41,903
This is crazy.

651
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,010
The Rolls, the Rolls,
don't... oh! Oh!

652
00:35:22,393 --> 00:35:25,664
Whoa! Major John Casey,
National Security Agency.

653
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,501
This is my badge?
Safety that weapon. It's cool, relax.

654
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,926
We're here to stop an attempt
on the Ambassador's life.

655
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:32,838
Be cool.

656
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,301
We're just trying to help.

657
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:35,799
On the ground!
Don't move!

658
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,833
Bomb!

659
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,262
On the ground!
Now!

660
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,851
You're risking your life!

661
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,816
No, I'm saving Morgan's!

662
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:45,309
Don't be an idiot.

663
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:48,649
Easy.

664
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,877
Hey, CIA. Let him go.

665
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,145
Where's Chuck?

666
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:59,490
Heroic imbecile took
off with the bomb.

667
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,868
Oh, my God, Chuck.

668
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,473
That was pretty sweet, huh?

669
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,309
What?

670
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,130
Did you think that I was...?

671
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,617
No, I was just using the...

672
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,375
Give me that.

673
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,101
Sorry.

674
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,784
Last-last favor.

675
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:46,293
Would you mind helping me get
something out of the trunk?

676
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:07,953
Hey...
are you okay?

677
00:37:08,036 --> 00:37:09,734
You really had me worried.

678
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:12,664
Oh, man...
I'm so embarrassed.

679
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,148
I can't even get my ass
kicked with any dignity.

680
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:17,986
Dude, I can't believe I fainted.

681
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,570
Yeah...

682
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:21,840
Yeah, yeah...

683
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:23,198
You fainted.

684
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:25,141
I'm such a coward.

685
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:26,994
I don't know, I guess...

686
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,914
Just the fear of a fight,
must've been too much for me.

687
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,865
And I'm sorry, Chuck.

688
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:35,128
I'm sorry that you had to save me...

689
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,378
Again.

690
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,338
Come on. Morgan...

691
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,674
Don't you know who you are to me?

692
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,373
Don't you know what you mean to me?

693
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:44,788
All that you've done?

694
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:48,682
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

695
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,012
You think you could butch it up
just a bit, though, bro.

696
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:52,227
Just like...

697
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:55,486
<i>Smooth Lau and her band
of cohorts were apprehended</i>

698
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:58,647
<i>at the scene, and Jason Wang has
just been taken into custody.</i>

699
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:01,077
<i>They will all be spending
a lot of time in prison</i>

700
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,330
- thanks to all of you.
- Thank you, General.

701
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:06,080
Furthermore, this incident
has left Ambassador Mei Sheng

702
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:08,744
with a renewed vigor
to crack down on Triad crime

703
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,089
both here and overseas.

704
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,915
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am late for my evening plans.

705
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,543
Uh, General, um,
if you don't mind me asking...

706
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,297
what exactly is your version
of evening plans?

707
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,884
- Bartowski!
- It's not top secret, Major.

708
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,261
I'm meeting Condoleeza for cosmos.

709
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,097
Even I have friends.

710
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:35,467
Sorry about delegating the music
stuff to Chuck.

711
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,455
But an apology is just words

712
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:39,412
if it's not followed up by actions.

713
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:41,964
So I got the flowers,
I bought the cake,

714
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:44,613
and I took care of your half
of the to-do list.

715
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,365
That's very sweet, Devon.

716
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,450
I'm also back in charge
of finding the band,

717
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,554
which is why we're here.

718
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:51,804
What?

719
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,460
Partnership is trust, babe.

720
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,379
Come on.

721
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,508
Partnership is trust.

722
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,727
- I can't do this, man.
- You can, I know you can.

723
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,038
No...
you see before,

724
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,601
Jeff, I wasn't really scared
that the band was going to break up.

725
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,519
The truth is, I was just sc...

726
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,483
You ever had a dream
that's never come true?

727
00:39:20,046 --> 00:39:22,317
I'm asking you to sing,

728
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:25,362
not for yourself...

729
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,758
do it for me.

730
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:55,164
<i>I hear the drums echoing
tonight</i>

731
00:39:55,247 --> 00:40:00,196
<i>but she hears only whispers
of some quiet conversation</i>

732
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,319
Honey, you're not seriously
considering this lame band

733
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:06,699
for our wedding day?

734
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:11,636
<i>kilimanjaro rises like olympus
above the serengeti</i>

735
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:15,845
No. But let a man have his dream.

736
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:17,359
Even if it is for five minutes.

737
00:40:17,442 --> 00:40:21,710
<i>hurry, boy,
it's waiting there for you</i>

738
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:28,300
<i>gonna take a lot to drag me
away from you</i>

739
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:32,948
<i>there's nothing that a hundred
men or more could ever do</i>

740
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:37,934
<i>I bless the rains
down in Africa</i>

741
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:42,939
<i>gonna take some time to do the
things we never had...</i>

742
00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:53,531
I wanted to apologize.

743
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:56,182
I could've been
more sensitive before

744
00:40:56,265 --> 00:40:57,939
about your friendship with Morgan.

745
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,173
It's just, it's difficult,

746
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:04,038
I don't really have anyone
in my life like that, who...

747
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,754
who cares about me.

748
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,216
<i>gonna take a lot to drag me
away from you</i>

749
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,014
- Yeah, you do.

750
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,673
<i>there's nothing that a hundred
men or more could ever do</i>

751
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:19,692
<i>I bless the rains
down in Africa</i>

752
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,532
Anna...

753
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,938
Listen, I should've said this
to you a long time ago.

754
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,110
All right?

755
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,362
But, Anna Wu...

756
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,611
I lo...

757
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:36,440
I like you...
very, very much.

758
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:41,790
<i>gonna take a lot to drag me
away from you</i>

759
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,617
<i>there's nothing that a hundred
men or more could ever do</i>

760
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:50,245
<i>I bless the rains
down in Africa</i>

761
00:41:50,328 --> 00:41:53,038
Look at us, man
We both got girlfriends.

762
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,239
<i>... rains
down in Africa</i>

763
00:41:55,322 --> 00:41:57,474
It's as good as it gets, man.

764
00:41:57,626 --> 00:42:01,787
<i>I bless the rains
down in Africa</i>

765
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:07,386
<i>I bless the rains
down in Africa</i>
