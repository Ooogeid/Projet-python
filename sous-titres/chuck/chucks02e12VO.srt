00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:01,900
Hi.
Joshua Gomez.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,338
Welcome to <i>Chuck.</i>

3
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:04,650
Do me a favor.

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,257
Put on your 3-D glasses right now.

5
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:11,689
Wow!
That's cool.

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,333
That is pretty amazing stuff.

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,680
Chuck.

8
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:23,513
Chuck.

9
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:26,678
Chuck, wake up.

10
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,516
Sarah, what are...?

11
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,490
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:37,868
Okay, uh, Sarah?

13
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:39,208
Yes, Chuck?

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,272
- This is a dream.
- No, it isn't.

15
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:44,911
Come on. Who are we...
Who are we kidding here, huh?

16
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,227
This is... This is clearly
my-my subconscious at work.

17
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:52,718
And on behalf of my conscious self,
I'd-I'd like to apologize.

18
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:56,273
I'm normally much more respectful
of women even in my dreams.

19
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,673
It's just that, you know, anxiety
and fear can-can really, um...

20
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:01,374
... affect your dream life.

21
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:03,254
And what are you afraid of?

22
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:07,149
I watched you kill that
Fulcrum agent in cold blood.

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,235
Sarah, I am...
I am not like you, okay?

24
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,874
I might have all these
government secrets in my brain,

25
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,455
but that does not make me
a real spy.

26
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:14,872
I need to tell you this
in reality, not in my dream.

27
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:15,979
Chuck.

28
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:19,723
This isn't a dream.

29
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:21,206
Oh, what is it?

30
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,656
It's a nightmare.

31
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:37,130
That's not the way
that dream was supposed to go.

32
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:45,063
- Chuck, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

33
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:48,810
I'm absolutely 100% on it.
Why?

34
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:51,070
Dude, you were totally
screaming last night.

35
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,935
- Like a little girl.
- Honey.

36
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:55,321
It was crazy how high it was.

37
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:58,117
I'm sorry about that,
but, yeah, I'm fe.

38
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,817
Bro, you're a tense coil
of stressed-out negativity.

39
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,993
- We don't mean to pry, but...
- Actually, we do. We do.

40
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:05,908
What's stressing you out?

41
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,140
Nothing... particular.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,421
You know, it's a little hectic
at work and stuff.

43
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,946
I didn't realize life got
so hectic at the Buy More.

44
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:16,719
Well, Chuck, maybe
what you need is a day off.

45
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:19,764
Good prescription, babe.
Chuck, that's exactly what you need.

46
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,689
You need to blow off some
steam, have some fun.

47
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,285
Take a day off, Chuck.

48
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,499
Dude,...

49
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:39,268
we got the day off.

50
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,078
What? What? What is...
What is going on?

51
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:45,414
- Tyler Martin is coming here.
- Tyler Martin?

52
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,583
<i>The</i> Tyler Martin?
Rock star Tyler Martin?

53
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:51,295
Rock star, legend, poet.
I've never actually heard him,

54
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,317
but apparently, he had this huge
promotion over at Large Mart,

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,547
and they pulled the plug because
of the whole sex tape thing.

56
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,128
- Have you seen it?
- No.

57
00:02:57,228 --> 00:03:00,107
Well, anyway, Big Mike heard
about it, and offered them our store.

58
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:02,315
- Thank you, Big Mike.
- That's what I'm saying.

59
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,412
This place is gonna
be so packed to the gills,

60
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:06,769
no one's even gonna notice
that we're doing diddly squat.

61
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,276
Get over here!

62
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,752
Have fun.

63
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:19,036
Grimes,...

64
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:20,348
got a job for you.

65
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,160
Old football buddy of mine,
Jimmy Butterman, just got paroled.

66
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,743
I told his PO
that we'd give him a job here

67
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:27,811
at Buy More so he could get back
on his feet.

68
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,427
An ex-con, sir?

69
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,377
I-I just...
Is that such a good idea?

70
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,795
He's a teammate, Grimes.

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,863
Teach him everything you know.

72
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:35,963
I will.

73
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,757
When you say prison, though,
are you talking, like, bars

74
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,304
and-and guards and, uh, showers?

75
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,687
- Get out!
- Get out. Getting... Okay.

76
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:48,818
Attention.

77
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,509
Attention!

78
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,974
Oh, thank you.

79
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:55,693
Ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,601
when my personal friend,

81
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,680
Mr. Martin, enters the store,
there is to be

82
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,689
no flash photography...

83
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,100
... no approaching of Mr. Martin
of any kind,

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,110
and most importantly,

85
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,469
no touching!

86
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,251
Consider yourself warned.

87
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,885
Sarah, Casey, there's a situation
in the Buy More.

88
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,688
- There is a guy with a grenade.
- I'm heading toward the store now.

89
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,116
Where is he?

90
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:47,118
- He's gone.
- Where is the grenade?

91
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:48,933
Go!

92
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,454
Don't open it!

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,461
It's a grenade.

94
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,838
It's gonna blow anyway, idiot.
I'll take it out front.

95
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,281
We can't take it out front.

96
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:00,950
There's people out there.
We got to take it out the back.

97
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,426
- You stay here.
- Casey!

98
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:05,096
Hey, that's my Tyler Martin display.

99
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:06,914
He is a hero of mine, Chuck.

100
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,073
Sorry, Lester.
Emergency.

101
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:11,143
Nobody treats Lester like that.

102
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,145
Jeff, let go!

103
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:16,255
Throw it.

104
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:18,985
Chuck!

105
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,843
Interception!

106
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:29,570
Why are we playing keep away?

107
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,280
Come on...

108
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,847
Oh, Grimes.

109
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,803
See you've met Mr. Butterman.

110
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:53,262
The other half
of the Defense of Death.

111
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,790
Blow it up!

112
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:56,164
What did we win?

113
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,874
- Good morning, Sarah.
- No time to diffuse it.

114
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,393
I got an idea.

115
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:03,779
Here.

116
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,537
Hold on. Open the door.

117
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,979
Get down!

118
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,075
Good morning, Chuck.

119
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,424
<i>The Subbers in Black presents...</i>

120

123
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,549
Agent Walker, Mr. Bartowski.

124
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,959
I'm sure you're wondering why would
someone want Tyler Martin dead.

125
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,707
Not really.
Have you heard his music?

126
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,712
It's overly produced, the lyrics
are completely banal.

127
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:17,488
I mean, Facebook even has a group
called I Want To Kill Tyler Martin.

128
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:19,730
Not that I'm a member.
I wouldn't ever...

129
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,013
That's just wrong.

130
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:23,515
Why don't you just share with General
the intel about the grenade

131
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,862
- that you flashed on?
- It was an IG-88 thermite charge.

132
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,169
That's military.

133
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,507
Commonly used by North African
intelligence units.

134
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:33,847
Interestingly, Tyler Martin recently
completed a tour of Africa.

135
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,301
I want you to find out who was
behind this attempt and why.

136
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,666
Well, the only way to do that
is to question Tyler Martin.

137
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,031
Then bring him in.

138
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,466
It can't be that hard
to get him alone.

139
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,072
All right. All right.

140
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,575
Hello, Cleveland!

141
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:03,958
Yeah.

142
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,141
This is Burbank.
Dude.

143
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:07,931
Whatever.

144
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,279
Now, I would like to thank

145
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,171
all of the humanitarians
that have affected my work.

146
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:16,537
Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela,
God rest his soul.

147
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:18,771
And my personal favorite,

148
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,355
Angelina Jolie.

149
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,726
As a thank you
to all my beautiful fans

150
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,821
who still buy Cds.
I've included this,

151
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:29,062
a ticket, a golden ticket...

152
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:31,042
- A golden ticket?
- Golden ticket!

153
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,417
... inside these.
My new CD.

154
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,399
It is a backstage invite

155
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,588
to a benefit concert
I'm having tomorrow night.

156
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:39,147
All right, we'll see you later.

157
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:42,563
That was great, Tyler.

158
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:45,320
This is gonna be huge for the
Tyler Martin brand, you realize that?

159
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,966
How are we supposed to grab
a rock star in broad daylight?

160
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,166
I mean, security's crawling
all over the place.

161
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,414
This is going to be easy.

162
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,905
- What...?
- <i>Catch you later, Gavin.</i>

163
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:07,688
What's gonna be easy?

164
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,764
I'm such a fan, Mr. Martin.

165
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:16,540
I'm a big fan of yours, too.

166
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:20,623
<i>- So, are you, uh, a</i>
- model, actress?

167
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,312
Massage therapist?

168
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,236
- <i>Maybe a</i>
- acrobat?

169
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:29,618
I can be whatever you want.

170
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:32,113
Idiot.

171
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,686
I think we got a pervert.

172
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:39,828
Oh, daisies.

173
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:43,272
Nighty-night, Tyler.

174
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,514
How much tranquilizer did you use?

175
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,314
It's a high grade at a heavy dose.

176
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:53,025
Mr. Martin should be out
for 12 to 24 hours.

177
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,155
Jet lag is brutal.

178
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:58,944
Rock star metabolism.

179
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,639
All the better
for seeing you, darling,

180
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,005
you know.

181
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,890
- I feel like a daffodil.
- Time for the road trip.

182
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:10,516
Road trip? Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

183
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,916
The Buy More parking lot camera
has a match on the car

184
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,497
- the suspect drove this morning.
- What about Tyler here?

185
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,785
Check his mouth every 20 minutes, make
sure he doesn't choke on his own tongue.

186
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,952
Hang on a second.
You're-you're gonna go,

187
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,952
and you want me to stay here
and be on tongue watch duty?

188
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,251
Well, you don't have plans, do you?

189
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,337
Would it be so crazy
if I did have plans?

190
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,464
Plans that involved something
other than fixing a computer

191
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,903
or playing hot potato
with a thermite grenade?

192
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,635
Yes.

193
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,009
<i>So, what's with Chuck?</i>

194
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:45,539
<i>The guy's got a point.</i>

195
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,110
He hasn't had a day off.

196
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,413
If you ask me, we're lucky
he didn't melt down months ago.

197
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,435
No, I think it's something else.
He's been acting

198
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,652
- strange since the holidays.
- Hold that thought.

199
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:08,132
We got a real fan boy, huh?

200
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,909
No, no,
there's something wrong here.

201
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,876
This is too neat.
It's too orderly.

202
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:14,190
Beckman was right.
We're dealing with a pro.

203
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,937
<i>Golden ticket's got</i>
<i>to be in here somewhere.</i>

204
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:20,820
I don't know, guys.
I mean, you think this is right?

205
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:23,934
This golden ticket's supposed
to be for Tyler Martin fans.

206
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:26,219
- Hey, I am a fan.
- So am I.

207
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,165
Yeah, so am I.

208
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,424
So, Mr. Butterman,
could you settle a bet?

209
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,709
Say it's our first day in prison.

210
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,556
Who do you think would be
considered the weaker gazelle?

211
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,260
You put anything in my mouth...

212
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,435
I will bite down hard.

213
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,251
- That's it.
- The golden ticket!

214
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:52,253
- Oh, my God, Morgan!
- Please, please.

215
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,740
- I am so happy for us, buddy.
- Please, please.

216
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:56,297
You don't want me to hurt them.

217
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:59,390
Fellas... please.

218
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:03,612
This ticket only entitles me
to a plus one,

219
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:06,171
okay, so we are gonna
have to settle this...

220
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,809
the Buy More way.

221
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,527
This ticket is Lester's...

222
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,529
and... and Butterman's.

223
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:35,277
What?!

224
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:40,445
No, hey, hey, excuse me.

225
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:43,971
This may be the most impressive
restroom I've ever seen in my life.

226
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:47,623
That ceiling looks just
like the night sky.

227
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,723
That's because that
<i>is</i> the night sky.

228
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,826
- Have I made a mistake?
- No.

229
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,636
Better question.
Where am I?

230
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,355
- Who are you?
- I'm Chuck, my name is Chuck.

231
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:03,766
And I...

232
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:06,435
- I work for the label.
- My record label?

233
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,909
Yes, yes, your record label.

234
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,118
There was a death threat
against you earlier today,

235
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:12,044
so we thought it might
be good to move you

236
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:14,484
- to this secure location.
- All right, well...

237
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:18,169
- I'd better go.
- Um, um, Mr. Martin,

238
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:21,733
you actually have
to stay here for the night.

239
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,713
The night?
No, no, no, Jack.

240
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:26,687
- Chuck, actually.
- I get death threats all the time, OK?

241
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:29,445
Besides...
it's party night.

242
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,843
- It's Tuesday.
- Exactly.

243
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:34,281
- I've got to go.
- Um, you know what?

244
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,079
Hey, hey, how about... I'm just
gonna call my bosses real quick.

245
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,608
Chuck, the record company
got you this phone, right?

246
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,538
Sure.

247
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,263
- Okay.
- Why...

248
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,751
I'll get you a new one.

249
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,375
Chuck...

250
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,099
in case you haven't noticed yet,

251
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,839
I just asked you to party...

252
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,615
with me.

253
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:05,511
Come on.

254
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:07,558
Come on.

255
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:09,718
Yeah.

256
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:10,969
What a night.

257
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:13,143
You got money, right?
'Cause I don't hold cash.

258
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,773
First, a little liquid nourishment.

259
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,772
Then, we'll get on
to the heavy drinking.

260
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:25,531
I'm actually more of a beer guy.

261
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,867
Something amber complected?
Not tonight, Chuck.

262
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,448
I may be a rum-soaked narcissist,

263
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:33,747
but I am also the best wingman
you will ever have.

264
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:35,392
Drink it down, mate.

265
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,985
See you guys in the emergency room!

266
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,777
Hello.

267
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,738
Gavin, you old slapper.

268
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,557
No, I'm with the rep
from the label.

269
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,000
Chuck!

270
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:56,372
- Never heard of you.
- I've never heard of <i>him.</i>

271
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:57,939
He's never heard of you!

272
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,705
No, never mind.
See you later.

273
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:02,178
Who's for another drink?

274
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,492
Ladies, tonight, all the drinks...

275
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,269
on the record company.

276
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:19,741
To determine who will be
the plus one of my golden ticket,

277
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:21,263
we will settle this with

278
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:24,077
Morgan's special triathlon.

279
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:25,007
First up...

280
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:28,052
the Molly Ringwald
underpants challenge.

281
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:30,226
The first of you to present to me

282
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,626
women's underpants is going to...

283
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,196
I'm a man.

284
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,028
For God's sake, I'm a man!

285
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:48,944
I'm actually going to accept these.

286
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,033
You know, a ticket's not
that important to me.

287
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,130
I need some ice.

288
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:58,841
Look, if you're worried about Chuck,
I can talk to him, scare him straight.

289
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:01,142
- I'd actually enjoy that.
- Uh, no, it's okay.

290
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:02,645
I'll get him under control.

291
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:11,884
Too late.

292
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:14,787
<i>So I said, "I'll give you
the dog for the trousers."</i>

293
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,316
That's how I got the trousers.

294
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:20,706
Hey, Chuck.
I'll tell you what you need.

295
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,621
- Aspirin!
- A tattoo.

296
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,170
Oh, no, no, no!
I'm not crazy about needles.

297
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,835
Ladies love a little bit of ink.

298
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:31,824
Whenever I do something amazing,
you know, feed the starving,

299
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:35,815
help the homeless,
rescue some emaciated refugee,

300
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:38,748
I map it out here on my body.

301
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,682
- How do you know what they all mean?
- Well, this here means...

302
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:45,575
serenity.

303
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:47,528
It's not...
it could be bliss.

304
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:50,097
I don't know Gavin,
my manager, sorts it all out.

305
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:52,632
You know, you got to kind
of trust the artist.

306
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,065
- Are you Tyler Martin?
- Yes, I am.

307
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,019
And this here is Chuck.

308
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,710
Chuck is in my band.

309
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:05,589
Yeah...

310
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,222
yeah, I'm in his band all right.

311
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:11,667
Drummer just laying the beats down.
Like a little drummer boy.

312
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,158
Come, they told me.
Pa-rump-a-pum-pum.

313
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:17,176
- Um... you guys want to dance?
- Yes.

314
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:18,474
- No.
- Yes, we do.

315
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:20,950
No, I'm not really
a dancer, you know?

316
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,684
Unless it's, like, some ballet or...
but this isn't a ballet place.

317
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:27,493
You know, I'm
much better at ironic dancing.

318
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:29,401
What happened to your accent?

319
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,983
Sorry.

320
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:33,416
I don't really have one.

321
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:34,852
I don't really care.

322
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:43,685
Round two.

323
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,474
The Subway sprint.

324
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,691
There's only one thing you got
to ask yourself, Butterman.

325
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,655
Do you like succulent chicken oozing
with bacon and ranch dressing?

326
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,615
I love succulent chicken.

327
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:56,931
I am in your head, sir.

328
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:00,722
Let's use this... Are you ready?
Set... Consume!

329
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:17,946
Oh, keep it down
or you're disqualified.

330
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,149
Keep it...

331
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,722
Keep it...
down.

332
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:25,815
Attaboy...
get to work.

333
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:32,421
Come on.
Come on, man.

334
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,369
We have a winner.

335
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:36,505
Winner!

336
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:40,597
Winner.

337
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:42,163
<i>The signal is weak,</i>

338
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:45,346
but I still have a trace on Chuck.
He's somewhere in the club.

339
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,122
Casey, it's him.

340
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:54,411
Damn it, he made me.
Go.

341
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,554
- Freeze!
- Halt!

342
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:02,135
Get on the ground.

343
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,743
You'll want to be
more gentle with me.

344
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:08,955
Get your hands up...
do it!

345
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:11,589
I'm going to walk away from you now.

346
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,696
- I'd rather we all go up.
- Casey, be careful.

347
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:18,824
Then, you should know that
Mr. Martin is still in danger.

348
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:21,205
I have some friends set to meet him.

349
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:23,996
So, by all means, stay here and die.

350
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,573
- Or you can go save him.
- Casey.

351
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:28,209
We gotta get Chuck come on.

352
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:47,108
Chuck!
We got a problem.

353
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,601
These girls want to take us upstairs

354
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:51,899
and do despicable things to us.

355
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,568
Tyler, Tyler, that's...
that's not such a great idea.

356
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,365
All the best nights of my life

357
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:59,144
have begun with that very sentence.

358
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,920
Which brings us to the final leg
of our triathlon.

359
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,756
- Good lord, is that...
- Yeah, Butterman, it is.

360
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:19,164
May I present
to you the urinal cake.

361
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,307
Okay, here's the deal.

362
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,816
The winner will be
the first one of you...

363
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,773
- Ah, come on.
<i>- That's disgusting.</i>

364
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,148
Dude, seriously, are you kidding me?

365
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:34,878
What is wrong with you?
You were just supposed to touch it.

366
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:37,285
I still win, right?

367
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:39,755
All right, who stole
the urinal cakes?

368
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,837
I splashed myself silly.

369
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,370
Welcome to Castle de Orlando,
Spanish conquistador.

370
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,716
So, I think we should
maybe just head...

371
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,682
Tyler, Tyler, I need
to talk to you, buddy.

372
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:05,008
- In a minute, Charles.
- No, no, it's very important.

373
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,909
- I need to talk to you right now.
- Ladies, I'm so sorry.

374
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,683
If you just go make yourself
comfortable right inside,

375
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,591
then maybe we could have our talk, and
then we'll join you in just a second.

376
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,791
- How does that sound?
- What?

377
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:15,135
Thanks so much.

378
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:16,697
Listen to me very carefully, Tyler.

379
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,563
These women are very,
very dangerous.

380
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:20,946
Don't worry.

381
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,483
I always use protection.

382
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,794
- Good looking out.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

383
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:29,983
I'm begging you, just once,
deny yourself this pleasure.

384
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,574
- You're right.
- That's totally selfish of me.

385
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:36,285
- Oh, good, lets go.
- You need this much more than I do.

386
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:38,506
No, no, Ty, no,
I'm not talking about...

387
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,094
Please don't, please...

388
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:43,897
Hey.

389
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,686
- I'm...
- Where's Tyler?

390
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,219
That's an excellent question.
T-Tyler, Tyler just...

391
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,994
he stepped away for a second, but
he's gonna be right back, I promise.

392
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,770
I guess you'll have to go first.

393
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,748
Go first where, go first what?

394
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,553
Why... where am I going first?

395
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,719
Why do I have to be first?
First is the worst,

396
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,973
second is the best, and third...!

397
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,658
Oh, h-hi.

398
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,812
Those are my shoes; I need those.

399
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,456
I need those shoes, I need those...
no, those are my pants!

400
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,089
I think that you have overestimated

401
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:21,009
my prowess as, as,
as a lover and a man.

402
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:24,507
Just looking at you,
I can feel that you require a...

403
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,971
a real rock star, so...

404
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:32,390
Tyler.

405
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,597
What happened
to not leaving your wingman?

406
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:44,344
Sarah.

407
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:45,981
Where are you?

408
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:49,118
Top floor, Tyler's suite,

409
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,287
or more specifically,
the roof outside of it.

410
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,372
Things have gotten
a little out of hand.

411
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:55,740
Aah!

412
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:02,915
Aah!

413
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,056
This is so romantic.

414
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,228
The perfect second honeymoon.

415
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,020
Could you push the button
for the lobby, please?

416
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:17,910
No, no, n-no, the lobby, the lobby!

417
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,731
Where you going,
where you going?

418
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,413
No, lob-lobby!
Don't...

419
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:38,793
Ladies.

420
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,670
Ladies, you ready for me?

421
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,483
Tyler, run!

422
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,612
Sorry, I must be going.

423
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:20,128
Get 'em, Sarah!

424
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:34,367
Lobby, please.

425
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:37,519
<i>Chuck, what were you thinking?</i>

426
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:40,317
You know, I gave you clear
instructions to keep him here.

427
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,478
And instead you take him
to a nightclub?

428
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:44,792
Interesting tactical decision there.

429
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,252
Time-out, listen, he woke
up and I couldn't stop him.

430
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,974
Okay, I don't have a knockout
karate chop like you guys.

431
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,450
- That's not part of my skill set.
- Where am I?

432
00:24:53,736 --> 00:24:56,386
- And how was I?
- Mr. Martin, we're with the government.

433
00:24:56,486 --> 00:24:58,045
We're here to protect you.

434
00:24:58,145 --> 00:25:00,768
Wait, there was an elevator.

435
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,880
Chuck, you were there.

436
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:04,454
T-Two girls.

437
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,785
One of them had a gun.
I-It was pointed at me.

438
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,646
Tyler, Tyler, it's all right. Just like
Casey said, we're here to protect you.

439
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:12,309
- I need to call my manager.
- No, Mr. Martin, I don't think that's

440
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:14,141
a good idea because
we don't know who's involved.

441
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:16,564
I have to call my manager.

442
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:18,559
Good show.

443
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:21,519
Casey, what is wrong with you?!
You can't do that!

444
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:24,780
You're going to give the guy
brain damage or liver problems.

445
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,453
Too late on both counts.

446
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:36,559
I know why they're trying to kill him.
I know why they want him dead.

447
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,704
- What?
- His back, the tattoo on his back.

448
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,851
It's not, it's not Arabic philosophy.
It's actually a very clear message

449
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:44,601
about a private reactor
that's being built in North Africa.

450
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,467
His manager is bringing in
the tattoo artists.

451
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,632
Of course. He's a rock star,
he travels the world.

452
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,925
Manager is using him
to move secrets.

453
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,032
Idiot never even knew
what the ink meant.

454
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:56,347
You're wrong about Tyler.
He's actually a pretty good guy.

455
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,683
He's an idiot, Bartowski,
just like you.

456
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,652
Should have never left
the two of you alone.

457
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:02,155
You know, Chuck, Casey is right.

458
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:03,890
You could have
gotten yourself killed.

459
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:05,415
What exactly were you thinking?

460
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,466
What was I thinking?
I'll tell you what I was thinking.

461
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,762
I was thinking like I wasn't a spy.

462
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,779
Okay? I was trying to have
a little bit of fun,

463
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,948
and I knew the second I called
you two, it would all be over.

464
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,721
But Chuck, you <i>are</i> a spy,
and you should know better than

465
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:20,366
to put yourself in a dangerous
situation where I can't protect you.

466
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:23,124
Is it really so wrong
for me to want a night off?

467
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,542
I was having a really good
time, too, until the assassins

468
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,169
stole my pants and tried to kill me.

469
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,482
I've earned it.
I deserve it.

470
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,743
I'm losing consciousness.

471
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:34,640
Casey!

472
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,335
My ears couldn't take it.

473
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:39,535
Either that or I shoot him.

474
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:49,550
You ready for a taste
of the sweet life tonight, buddy?

475
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,684
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Backstage passes.

476
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,340
You know what that means, don't you?

477
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:54,614
No, I've never been
backstage.

478
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:57,040
That ticket's our
passport to freedom.

479
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,351
Not only is there
free beer backstage,

480
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,055
but there are women
that haven't been sober for years,

481
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,791
and we're allowed in,
so the ladies assume we're not losers.

482
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:09,083
Wow... it sounds like a fairy tale.

483
00:27:09,646 --> 00:27:11,213
Poor Butterman.

484
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:14,881
The guy's been trapped
in an 8x10 cell for years.

485
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:18,483
He ate when they said "Chow time,"

486
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:22,040
and he slept when they shouted
"Lights out!"

487
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:23,684
Now look at him.

488
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:25,118
Broken.

489
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:27,980
The man had a choice of five sodas,

490
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,358
a choice we take
for granted every day,

491
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:34,843
a choice he's been
denied for far too long.

492
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:39,058
I'm sorry, Jeff, this ticket
doesn't belong to us.

493
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,243
This ticket belongs to Butterman.

494
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:43,788
The man deserves
his passport to freedom.

495
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:47,135
You and I,
we're going to give it to him.

496
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:48,668
I'll make it up to you.

497
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,920
I'll buy you a keg.
What do you like?

498
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,282
It's called Beer.

499
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,923
- Done... done.
- Beer brand.

500
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,393
<i>Your flash turned
up good intel, Chuck.</i>

501
00:27:56,493 --> 00:27:59,272
The man you confronted
last night is Achmed Gambir,

502
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:01,722
a top foot soldier in
a private army in North Africa.

503
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:04,354
We've been trying to infiltrate
their ranks for years.

504
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,723
I want you to capture Achmed
at tonight's concert.

505
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:09,211
He's the key
to bringing down this merc army.

506
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:10,631
What... wait, wait.

507
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,858
You want Tyler onstage as bait?

508
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,507
General, Mr. Martin knows there are
people after him and he won't go on.

509
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:19,200
Well, then convince him.

510
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,070
Wait, no, no.

511
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:23,191
No, no, guys, hey,

512
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,691
this is way too dangerous.
Tyler could get killed.

513
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,786
Those are nightmares
tattooed on his body, Chuck.

514
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:30,381
- We have to take Gambir down tonight.
- Okay, okay, fine, fine,

515
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:32,792
you go in there and tell him
he has to put his life on the line

516
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,821
because he was a pawn
in someone else's game.

517
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:36,479
He won't listen to us.

518
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:39,444
So you want me to do it?
No, absolutely not.

519
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:41,837
What do you mean no?
We have orders.

520
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,233
Chuck, what is the matter with you?

521
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:45,554
This is about more
than just taking a night off.

522
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:47,945
Maybe.

523
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,158
Um, I... you know, I'm a little
off my game right now.

524
00:28:52,258 --> 00:28:54,196
I'm not, not really sleeping.
I don't want to get into it.

525
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,193
Chuck, lives are
on the line right now,

526
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:59,471
and if Tyler doesn't help us, then
he will never be free of those people,

527
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,783
and if you don't help us,
then Achmed Gambir gets away.

528
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:05,560
And the world becomes
a more dangerous place.

529
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,248
I don't know what happened
to you, but this is our job...

530
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:13,028
not only to protect Tyler but the country
and anybody else who needs protecting.

531
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,683
We do whatever it takes
no matter what.

532
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,663
Did you forget that?

533
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,130
That I definitely didn't forget.

534
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,220
We don't have time for this.

535
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,338
Wait.

536
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:27,373
I'll do it.

537
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:30,021
I'll convince him.

538
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,587
Hey, man.

539
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,133
You okay?

540
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:53,394
No.

541
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,333
No, I'm not okay.

542
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:58,088
Don't know where I am,
how I got here,

543
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,986
and someone's trying to kill me.

544
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:04,342
On the plus side, your friend's
tranqs are out of this world.

545
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:07,472
Yeah, it's one
of his few good qualities.

546
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,686
I've never been in a situation
like this before, life...

547
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,972
or death.

548
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:14,444
Pretty much live my life

549
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,398
avoiding anything this real.

550
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,678
It takes some getting used to.

551
00:30:22,408 --> 00:30:24,390
What do you want me to do?

552
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:29,885
We would like for you

553
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,081
to perform tonight
at your special concert.

554
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:35,218
That's madness.
People are trying to kill me.

555
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:38,200
Yes, and you can help us catch them.

556
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,465
You can help the world, the entire
world, by doing this, for real.

557
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,904
You could go back
to living your life again.

558
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,573
One night of bravery

559
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:52,977
for an entire life of normalcy.

560
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,424
I can't even tell you
what I'd give for that.

561
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:09,022
How do I know I can trust them?

562
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,647
Your people?

563
00:31:11,948 --> 00:31:13,247
Because I do.

564
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:15,982
They're the best.

565
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:18,562
I stake my life on it every day.

566
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,945
I got one thing to say.

567
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:32,308
- Hello, Cleveland.
- It's Burbank.

568
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:33,476
Right.

569
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:34,889
I'm dyslexic.

570
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:43,177
You boys have given
me back hope. Thanks.

571
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,630
You deserve a taste
of the sweet life, man.

572
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:47,595
Enjoy it for all of us.

573
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:49,614
- Do us proud, Butterman.
- Thanks.

574
00:31:58,571 --> 00:31:59,735
There you go.

575
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:08,594
Dude, how could you just sell
the golden ticket like that?

576
00:32:08,871 --> 00:32:10,246
Sorry, guys.

577
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,815
I found out how much these
things are going for online.

578
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:15,810
But your freedom, man.
Was it worth the price of freedom?

579
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,447
Price of my freedom is 800 bucks.

580
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:20,935
Same as my ticket to Zihuatanejo.

581
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:22,817
See you never.

582
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:24,879
Enjoy hell.

583
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:28,706
Get busy living, or get busy dying.

584
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,463
True that.

585
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,296
Well, back to work.

586
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:39,845
<i>20 minutes till
Tyler Martin takes the stage.</i>

587
00:32:50,032 --> 00:32:51,345
- Chuck.
- Yeah, I'm here.

588
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:54,063
Don't let Tyler take the stage
till we give the okay.

589
00:32:54,163 --> 00:32:55,614
Okay.
Got it.

590
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,773
Sarah, made the mark.
Get on my six and intercept him.

591
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,909
Who are you?
Why you wearing this?

592
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,619
Some guy gave me free tickets.

593
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,583
He just said I had to wear
this stupid jacket.

594
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:15,516
- He's ahead of us.
- Which one is he?

595
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:28,833
Sorry, buddy, no one allowed
to see Mr. Martin.

596
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,481
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

597
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:38,895
Let me get that.

598
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:40,526
Yeah, you get it, Chuck.

599
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:44,277
Open this door.

600
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:46,293
- It's him. It's him.
- Who?

601
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:47,860
The guy who's trying to kill you?

602
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,779
Here?
I thought you said we were safe.

603
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,628
- I know you're in there, Mr. Martin.
- Oh, I need another drink.

604
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:54,153
That's a good idea.

605
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:56,140
No, that's... no. No.

606
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,862
- Hey, get in there. Get in there.
- I said open this door!

607
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:00,623
- What about you?
- I'll be all right.

608
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,147
Just, just stay in the closet.

609
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,522
Wait.

610
00:34:03,622 --> 00:34:05,086
Take off your shirt.

611
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:06,746
Just trust me.

612
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:16,389
- Sarah, it's Chuck.
- Chuck. What is it?

613
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,599
Achmed. Achmed's right outside
the dressing room.

614
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,534
I don't know what happened
to the guards.

615
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:22,338
OK, Chuck, stay right where you are.

616
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:24,431
Look, I didn't need the night off.
You were right,

617
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:27,450
it's something else. I should've
told you. I should have....

618
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,259
Chuck?
Chuck, can you hear me?

619
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,309
Move.
Excuse me. Go!

620
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,950
I think maybe,
maybe you have the wrong room.

621
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,794
Tell me where he is?

622
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,293
Tell you where who is?

623
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:48,969
Oh, where where
he is where Tyler is.

624
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:51,799
Right. He, you know, he... he
skipped out. I don't know where he is.

625
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,463
So sorry.
I don't know. He's gone.

626
00:34:58,516 --> 00:34:59,893
He's in the closet.

627
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:01,917
Excuse me.
Move!

628
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,421
Coming through.
Move.

629
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,991
Okay, you got us. Yeah, worse plan ever.
But I know about the tattoo.

630
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:11,245
I know what it means.

631
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,696
You and your private
army enriching uranium,

632
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,384
selling it to unstable countries.

633
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:19,097
Using Tyler's manager and his tattoos
to pass the info off to your buyers.

634
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,250
You take one more step,

635
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,641
I send this e-mail
and everyone knows.

636
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:26,450
Proving that the cell is
mightier than the sword.

637
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,629
Or, or a very large knife,
as it might be in this case.

638
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:31,699
Go! Excuse me.
Move!

639
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,165
Put it down.

640
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,041
Put it down!

641
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:45,353
No!

642
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:46,738
No!

643
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:48,626
I can't let you do this
for me Chuck.

644
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,946
Actually, my plan was
working very well.

645
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,393
- No!
- No!

646
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:00,348
- Follow me.
- Tyler, what's going on, man?

647
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:02,834
- Gavin, you're fired!
- Sarah, we're running to the stage.

648
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:05,362
- He's right behind us.
- Chuck, are you okay?

649
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:08,960
- Yeah, yeah, just get us out of here.
- Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

650
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:13,186
Everybody give
it up for Tyler Martin!

651
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:22,974
Help.

652
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,897
Los Angeles.

653
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:33,702
What do we do now?

654
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:43,010
- Jump.
- What?

655
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:44,411
Jump.

656
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:46,706
Chuck!

657
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:47,658
Jump!

658
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:01,206
It's all good, it's all good,
Chuck, relax.

659
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,571
Come on, take it easy.
Okay, okay.

660
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:13,065
Stephanie, right?
Stephanie.

661
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:14,030
Yeah!

662
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,968
You think I look mad,
wait till you see her.

663
00:37:45,256 --> 00:37:47,599
A little too much to drink
there, huh, pal?

664
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,016
- Uh, let's get you some coffee.
- We got him! Ha, ha, ha!

665
00:37:51,116 --> 00:37:54,122
- See? I told you they were the best!
- Yeah, that's it, all right.

666
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,944
Now back to the stage.
Come on, I want to sing now.

667
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,278
All right, like he said,
back to the stage.

668
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,152
Who the hell are you?

669
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:15,336
Grimes?
Where's my boy Butterman?

670
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,038
He kind of took off suddenly.

671
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:20,425
Can't say I blame him. Man's gotta run
free after being locked up so long.

672
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:22,298
Yeah, yeah, well, um, Big Mike,

673
00:38:22,398 --> 00:38:24,960
do mind if I ask you what Butterman
was in the can for?

674
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,235
I mean, you talking robbery? Drugs?

675
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,183
- Murder?
- Butterman?

676
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,005
- Yeah.
- God, no!

677
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:33,406
Bank fraud, insider trading.

678
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:35,243
The man's a white-collar criminal.

679
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:36,986
Why? He take you fools
for some money?

680
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,293
- He said he was going somewhere.
- Zihuatanejo?

681
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,198
That's Mexican for Philadelphia.

682
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,924
I knew I should have
learned Spanish.

683
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,822
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>my manager's going to jail.</i>

684
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:54,500
Think about it.
No privacy.

685
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,586
It'd be like hell on bloody earth.

686
00:38:56,754 --> 00:38:58,921
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

687
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:01,932
You understand why you're gonna have
to get your tattoos removed, right?

688
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:04,634
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I hear you're the bro to talk to

689
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:07,122
to get more of those
tasty tranq darts.

690
00:39:08,322 --> 00:39:09,621
Philistine.

691
00:39:11,577 --> 00:39:13,804
- Thanks, Chuck.
- Oh, hey, it was nothing.

692
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:15,598
No, no, it was everything.

693
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:19,360
You taught me to put people
in front of myself.

694
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,942
Felt kind of wonderful.
I can strike that off the list now.

695
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:26,881
If you ever want to party,
you know where to come.

696
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,059
Yeah, actually, I don't think
that's my scene.

697
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,621
Smart man, Chuck.
Smart man.

698
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,051
All right.

699
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:37,293
- Take it easy.
- You, too.

700
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,004
- Hello, Mr. Martin.
- Your limousine is waiting outside.

701
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:42,248
You know my name.

702
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,829
Have we made love before?

703
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:45,891
No.

704
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:50,759
Daddy's got to go.
Sorry. Later.

705
00:39:58,485 --> 00:40:00,711
You did a great job, Chuck.

706
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,348
Thanks.

707
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:06,320
Look, if-if there's something
bothering you,

708
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,703
then please tell me.

709
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:10,785
I know part of your job is to have
all these secrets in your head,

710
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:13,741
but you're not supposed
to keep them from me.

711
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:15,494
I know. I know.

712
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,450
I saw you shoot that
Fulcrum agent on Christmas Eve

713
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,676
after they took over the Buy More.

714
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:31,640
- And when I asked you about it...
- I lied.

715
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,628
Yeah.

716
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,861
- Chuck, I have to protect you.
- I know that. I, I...

717
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:40,118
I know that you do.

718
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:43,150
And you were protecting me.
You were protecting all of us.

719
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:45,594
He had threatened
my family, my friends,

720
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,205
and you were just doing
your job... I get that, but...

721
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:51,158
Sarah, the guy was unarmed

722
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,268
- and, and you just...
- I did what I had to.

723
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,838
He knew who you really were.
Your whole family was in danger.

724
00:40:57,198 --> 00:40:58,848
And I'm sorry.

725
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:02,641
Sometimes I forget that
you never asked for all of this.

726
00:41:05,308 --> 00:41:07,779
There's parts I'm not sure
I'll ever get used to.

727
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,932
Well, you deserve a break.

728
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:15,767
So, take tonight, tomorrow
whatever you need, it's yours.

729
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:18,008
Seriously? Really?

730
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,711
Yeah, no missions,
no cameras, no Casey,

731
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,717
no thermal satellite
surveillance and no me.

732
00:41:24,727 --> 00:41:26,986
- You guys use satellites?
- Yeah.

733
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:32,040
And Chuck, when you're ready again,
we'll be here, waiting.

734
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,644
Hey, what's this?
What's going on?

735
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,638
- Lock and load.
- A new mission.

736
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:39,204
We'll see you tomorrow.

737
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:43,068
Wait, a new, a new mission?
What kind of mission?

738
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:46,074
It's fine, Chuck.
We've got it.

739
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:50,574
What, what kind of mission?

740
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:57,124
Ah, finally,
a mission without Bartowski.

741
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,294
I'm going to enjoy this.

742
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:00,958
Okay, guys.

743
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:04,124
Where are we going?

744
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,214
Well, come on, Casey. No time
for a break, we've got work to do.

745
