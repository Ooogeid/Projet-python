1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,466
MAN:
Morgan, this is a bad idea.

2
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:16,733
MORGAN:
Well, we can't stay here, Chuck.

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,800
CHUCK:
I'm uncomfortable with the plan.

4
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,267
MORGAN:
Plan? What plan?
This is survival.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,833
(knocking on door)
That's her. We've
been compromised.

6
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm a ghost.

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,700
Morgan, you can't
leave me like this.

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,267
You can't do this
to me, man.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,334
Chuck, what are you doing?

10
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,033
Uh, escaping.

11
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:34,466
From your own birthday party?

12
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:37,267
Wow, you look fan...

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,700
...tastic.

14
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:40,366
Uh, you know, sis,
the thing is,

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,033
Morgan and I don't really
feel like we're fitting in...

16
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,533
at <i>my</i> birthday party,

17
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:48,399
'cause we don't know
anybody,

18
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:56,000
'cause they're
all your friends

19
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,399
Well, your jokes.

20
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,033
Okay, my jokes.

21
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:03,967
Chuck, I have invited
real, live women for you.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,466
So please... let's go.

23
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,733
Morgan, you stay here.

24
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:11,200
Need a hand,
buddy?

25
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:13,733
No, no, no, I'm okay,
I'm all right.

26
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:21,033
ELLIE:
Birthday boy, come with me.

27
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,200
We're going to be social.

28
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,167
You are funny, you are smart,
you are handsome.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,867
Thank you. Oh, there's
Captain Awesome.

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,234
Please don't
call him that.

31
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,334
Okay, I've identified
some candidates for Chuck

32
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,499
and they are awesome.

33
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,666
Let me introduce
you to Chuck-- Ellie's brother.

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,366
Hi, Chuck.
We've heard
so much about you.

35
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,733
Are you in
a costume?

36
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,967
"Nerd Herd"?
That is so cute.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,933
What do you really want to do?

38
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,366
Working on my five-year plan.

39
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,700
Just need to choose a font.

40
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:48,000
What happened here?
Did you hurt your hand?

41
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:52,633
The controller chafes
after several hours.

42
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,533
Yes, that's technically correct.

43
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:55,200
I graduated in '02.

44
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:57,167
What was
your major?
Engineering.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh, my God, I knew
this great guy.

46
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,466
He was an engineer, um,
he ran track

47
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,933
and I think he was
a gymnast, too.

48
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:05,900
Bryce Larkin-- he was
my roommate.
Oh, yes.

49
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,234
What's he doing now?

50
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,533
I think he's an accountant.

51
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:13,200
(distant siren wails)

52
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,334
(grunts)

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,067
(shoes squeak)

54
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,067
(frantic typing)

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,600
(panting)

56
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,466
It's hard to say good-bye.

57
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,300
(male voice):
Security breach. Data vault.

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,300
So, do you have a girlfriend?

59
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:58,200
Uh, no... I did
a while back at Stanford.

60
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:00,566
Oh.
Yeah.

61
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,766
We met
freshman year.

62
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,366
Oh, that <i>was</i> a while back.

63
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,833
I remember

64
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:07,300
when I met Jill, I was...
it was an economics class.

65
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,433
I was walking
across the quad

66
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,000
and she had dropped her bag,

67
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,167
and I was like, you know,
rushing to...

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,967
to go and pick it up for her,
and, uh...

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,867
and we kind of, like,
did that whole, like, you know,

70
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
kind of in a cartoon--
kind of bumped heads, and...

71
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,633
There was a whole gang
of us-- Jill and Bryce.

72
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,867
We had so much in common then.

73
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,867
Ah!

74
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,766
Not awesome.

75
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,300
So there I was--

76
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:35,033
Jill with Bryce,
me on a train home.

77
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:40,466
(music playing)

78
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,533
Larkin is in the vault.

79
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,133
Larkin,
open the door!

80
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,967
The Intersect Computer's
been compromised.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,033
Blow the door!
We can't let him go!

82
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,933
Call for backup.
Larkin!

83
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,733
(alarm blaring)

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,533
(yelling)

85
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,399
Freeze!

86
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,766
Stop right there!

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,067
(grunting)

88
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,466
Larkin!

89
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:13,000
(grunts)

90
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,933
(alarm continuing)

91
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,600
Cover right!

92
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,900
(panting)

93
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,334
Larkin, stop!

94
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:37,766
(screaming)

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
MAN (over radio):
Larkin is on the roof.

96
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:42,433
All units converge. I repeat,
Larkin is on the roof.

97
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:45,133
All units converge.

98
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,167
(groaning) 

99
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:06,466
(grunts)

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,666
Don't move.

101
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,133
Too late, Casey.

102
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,334
(sizzles)

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,499
Thanks for
my party.

104
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:43,366
Your seven-layer dip...
tasted like eight.

105
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,167
It really was
eight layers?

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,666
Even though
we may ask,

107
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,900
no woman really wants to hear
about an old girlfriend.

108
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,000
It's depressing, okay?

109
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,800
Stanford was five years ago.

110
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,133
You need to move on.
It's time.

111
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,200
Do we really have to have
this conversation again?

112
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,867
We've rehearsed it enough.

113
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,300
Fine. I'll get over
Jill tomorrow.

114
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,566
Hey, there.

115
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,967
(sighs)

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,900
Seems like everybody had
a really good time, huh?

117
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,067
I know I did.

118
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,466
Super.

119
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,300
Cheer up, Chuck,
you talked to some women.

120
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:21,633
You know,
it's a start.

121
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,267
Wow.
Blast-from-the-past wow.

122
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,366
Bryce remembered
your birthday, dude.

123
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,800
The guy who got you
kicked out of school,

124
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,967
the guy who stole your girl,
remember that guy?

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,499
Yeah, Morgan, I think
I remember Bryce.

126
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,533
All right, well...

127
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:37,700
what, uh, what
do we got here?

128
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,566
Huh, what is it?

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,334
 <i>Zork...</i> You remember <i>Zork</i>
the old text-based video game?

130
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,700
Well, Bryce and I programmed
our own version of it

131
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,800
back at Stanford
using a TRS-80.

132
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,666
Wow, you guys
were really cool.

133
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,167
Yeah, if I could
only remember

134
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,234
what was in my
hero's satchel.

135
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:56,300
The weapons that I would use
to kill the Terrible Troll.

136
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,800
Right. You know what,
you're still really cool.

137
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,700
And, uh,
you're going home.

138
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,666
Is it that time?
It's that time.

139
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,433
Right.

140
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,566
Pedal safe!
Thank you.

141
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,867
(mutters)

142
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:12,900
Attack...

143
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,499
troll...

144
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,867
with nasty knife.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,967
(blipping)

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,766
(cacophous audio plays
throughout)

147
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:02,533
(alarm buzzing)

148
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,633
(thuds)

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,835
(distorted voice):
Chuck?

150
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:14,835
Chuck.

151
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,901
Dude...

152
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:23,034
(normal voice):
Dude, you-you okay?

153
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,334
Morgan?

154
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,768
Yeah, man, yeah, it's me.

155
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:27,034
What happened?

156
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,067
(grunts and sighs)

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,034
I was going to ask you
the same question.

158
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,234
MORGAN:
You okay?

159
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,534
Did you spike the punch?

160
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:38,835
Something goes wrong,
you blame me.

161
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,301
After all these years,
where's the trust?

162
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,835
Yes, I did.

163
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:44,501
ANNOUNCER:
The 101 is clear
at Universal City.

164
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,301
Watch out for delays
near Burbank Airport.

165
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,401
Security's checking
all vehicles.

166
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:52,935
We got a Sigalert on the I-605,

167
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,034
San Gabriel River Freeway,
southbound.

168
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,835
A fender-bender on the I-5,
Santa Ana Freeway,

169
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,100
northbound,
from 91 Freeway to the I-...

170
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,568
MORGAN:
 <i>So this morning</i>
 <i>I'm playing Xbox.</i>

171
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:01,501
and I'm like, dude, just let me
get the sniper rifle,

172
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:04,067
I'll take care of it-- the guy
won't give me the sniper rifle.

173
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I made him eat a frag grenade.
Morgan, Morgan,
Morgan, Morgan.

174
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,301
As much as I would love

175
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:08,868
to talk video games
with you right now,

176
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:09,967
I've got a really
splitting headache

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,334
and I... In fact,
you know what?

178
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,301
Can you do me a favor?
Do you mind driving?

179
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:14,434
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

180
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:15,734
Are you-are you, look,
are you being serious?

181
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:16,801
You're going
to let me drive?

182
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,534
It's a company car, Morgan.

183
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:19,801
It's not that
big a deal.

184
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,901
It's not just a
company car, okay?

185
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:23,468
A hoopty's
a hoopty, home boy.

186
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:26,501
I mean, this baby's
sitting on chrome.

187
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,634
Do me a favor
and stay off the 5, okay?

188
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,768
Because the cops are
in a phased... deployment.

189
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:35,801
Okay.

190
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,468
Thanks for the tip, Ponch.

191
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,634
(music playing)

192
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,734
Fellow nerds, today is going
to be a very bad day.

193
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:48,067
We've got a new computer
virus on our hands.

194
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,701
They're calling this one
the Irene Demova virus.

195
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,067
(laughing)

196
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,234
Yes, yes, it's named after
the Serbian porn star.

197
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,768
Lonely dude call volume
will be high.

198
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:59,835
This is a nasty one, kids.
It's a computer killer.

199
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:03,935
Last night, the display version
of our Prism Express laptop

200
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,568
was fried when <i>someone...</i>

201
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:06,768
Excuse me...
decided to enter

202
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:09,000
Ms. Demova's Web site.

203
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,100
Anna, close the eyes.

204
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,134
This is what happens.

205
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,000
WOMAN:
Food is sexy?

206
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,267
Am I sexy?

207
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:18,367
(voice distorts):
Am I... sexy...?

208
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:26,501
But that's love.

209
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,234
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll please just ignore

210
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,701
Dirty Uncle Morgan,

211
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,468
I think that everything...

212
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,167
...to arrive in Los Angeles
later today

213
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,967
to deliver a speech before
the Pacific Security League

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,100
tomorrow evening.
...will be...

215
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:42,434
The general has drawn fire
for his criticism...
...normal.

216
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:46,334
General Stanfield, the former
Allied Commander of NATO...

217
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:49,401
He's already here.

218
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:50,967
He landed last night.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,067
Who's already
here, Chuckles?

220
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,301
I don't know.

221
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:02,868
We'll have updates
for you as events unfold.

222
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:06,501
WOMAN:
 <i>Bryce Larkin was CIA, Graham.</i>

223
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,000
He was one of your agents.

224
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:14,801
GRAHAM:
And it was NSA's job
to find him

225
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,601
No, you got a dead CIA agent.

226
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,367
It's a gold star in my book.

227
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,801
If this gets out...
It won't.

228
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:20,801
Nobody asked you.

229
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:22,234
Actually, they did.

230
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,067
Major Casey
is heading up

231
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,167
this investigation.

232
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,367
So what was
Bryce after, hmm?

233
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,034
What did this
computer do?

234
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,868
Well, this computer
did everything.

235
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,067
After 9/11,

236
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,835
the NSA and the CIA were told
to play nice--

237
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,801
Every scrap of data we had
went into this computer.

238
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,334
 <i>It mined for patterns</i>
 <i>in the chatter.</i>

239
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,000
 <i>Saw things we didn't.</i>

240
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:48,401
WOMAN:
 <i>The data was encrypted</i>
 <i>into thousands of images.</i>

241
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:54,701
 <i>Whoever received Larkin's</i>
 <i>e-mail got all of our secrets.</i>

242
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,835
I found this on Larkin.

243
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,801
Hard drive is fried.

244
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,067
We picked up a trace signature.

245
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,401
Where?

246
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,434
Los Angeles.

247
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:07,501
Which is perfect-- I've been
feeling a little pasty.

248
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,100
Stop the presses!

249
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,100
Who is <i>that?</i>
Vicki Vale.

250
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:22,201
(singsongy):
Vicki Vale, Vick-Vicki Vale.

251
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:24,801
Vickity-Vickity, Vicki Vale,
Vic-Vicki Vale.

252
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:30,367
I hope I'm not interrupting.

253
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:32,167
That's... it's from <i>Batman.</i>

254
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,668
'Cause that
makes it better.

255
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:34,801
(chuckles nervously)

256
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,301
Hi. I'm Morgan.

257
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:37,835
This is, uh, this is Chuck.

258
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,568
Wow! I didn't think people
still named their kids

259
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,668
Chuck, or Morgan,
for that matter.

260
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,401
My parents are sadists,

261
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,067
and carnival freaks
found him in a Dumpster.

262
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,568
But they raised me
as one of their own.

263
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,801
How can I help... you?

264
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:51,868
Sarah.
Sarah.

265
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,100
I'm here about this.

266
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, yeah. The Intelicel.
Yeah. Absolutely.

267
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:59,668
This model has a little screw
that pops loose

268
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,601
right in the back here.

269
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,401
Just go ahead and give it
a couple of quick turns

270
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,434
and...

271
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,501
good as new, no problem.

272
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:10,000
Wow! You geeks <i>are</i> good.

273
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:12,601
Nerds.
I would say nerds
probably more...

274
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,167
It's no big deal.

275
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,234
...you know, yeah.
I mean, Nerd Herd.

276
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,334
Excuse me. Excuse me.

277
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,468
I have an emergency.

278
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,034
I don't know what I did wrong,

279
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,434
but I shot the entire recital,

280
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:22,234
but, um, now it...
now it won't play back.

281
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay. Okay.
We'll just take a look and...

282
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:28,201
You don't have a tape in here.

283
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:31,067
But it's digital.
Oh, boy.

284
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,201
Right. Yes. But you

285
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,534
still need digital tape. 

286
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:37,601
Oh, no. Her mom's
going to kill me.

287
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,734
Uh... Morgan,
I need the wall.

288
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:42,868
It's yours.

289
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm so sorry.

290
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,967
Okay. This... this way.

291
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,434
You ready?

292
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:51,768
What's wrong?

293
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,367
I'm usually
in the back row.

294
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:54,801
Why?

295
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,167
I'm too tall.

296
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,167
I block the 
other ballerinas.

297
00:13:58,201 --> 00:13:59,434
Can I tell you
a secret?

298
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:00,868
But you can't tell
the other girls.

299
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:05,201
 Real ballerinas
 <i>are</i> tall.

300
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,801
(classical music plays)

301
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,967
(applause)

302
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,134
Did you get it? Did it work?

303
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,267
Five minutes?

304
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:48,034
Do you know what five minutes
means inuy More dollars?

305
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,701
Look, I'm sorry
about all the commotion.

306
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,601
We are not stock boys
anymore, Chuck!

307
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,935
We are leaders,
Buy More

308
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,367
leaders.

309
00:14:55,401 --> 00:15:02,234
And you wonder why Big Mike
wants me for assistant manager.

310
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:03,701
Big Mike didn't tell me
about that.

311
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:07,701
And why should he?

312
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:21,801
Chuck, dude,
she left you her card.

313
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,234
(sniffs)

314
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:26,601
MORGAN:
 <i>Why wouldn't</i>
 <i>you call this girl?</i>

315
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,234
Oh, I don't know.
Did you see her?

316
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,501
Yes. Oh, man, yes.

317
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,134
That's why I'm going
to repeat the question.

318
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,601
Why wouldn't you
call this girl?

319
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,434
Because I live
on planet Earth, Morgan.

320
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,134
Why are you following me home?

321
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,401
Aw, come... Hey.
We're buddies.

322
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:39,935
We're going to go
do friend things,

323
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,801
and... and... I need
to use your computer

324
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:43,868
because mine's still
acting up on me.

325
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,768
(chuckles):
Irene Demova.

326
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:50,668
Ah! So beautiful
and so... deadly.

327
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,401
BOTH (sighing):
Yeah.

328
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:53,935
You know, you got
to understand.

329
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,634
This is what I've
been telling people

330
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,601
for I don't know
how long...

331
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,634
Please, not the computer.

332
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:07,267
(electro-pop music plays)

333
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,334
Aah!

334
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,301
Oh!

335
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,267
(music playing)

336
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,868
Give me the...
(stammering)

337
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:24,434
Oh!

338
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:25,901
(grunts)

339
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:27,534
(coughing)

340
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:31,501
That's my friend!

341
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,468
(yelling)

342
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,034
Okay, look, he's not
that good of a friend.

343
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:48,568
Didn't you hang that shelf?

344
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Damn it!

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,634
(metal clattering)

346
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,333
Nah, I've been through it.

347
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,834
It's dead. It's totally fried.

348
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,700
This hard drive was...

349
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,933
murdered.

350
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,333
What if you were
the unwitting target

351
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,567
of a ninja vendetta,

352
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,734
and he returns tonight

353
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,634
to strangle you
with his nunchakus?

354
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
That's super, Jeff.

355
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:24,133
Thanks for thinking
outside the box on that one.

356
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,400
And here I thought I couldn't
get any more freaked out.

357
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,367
I'm going to go
buy some new locks

358
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,834
next door at Large Mart.

359
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:36,167
(Muzak plays over PA)

360
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,133
Oh, thank God.
Uh... Excuse me, sir.

361
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,467
Do you know
where they sell the...?

362
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,233
NEWS ANCHOR:
 <i>Officials are trying to stop</i>

363
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:00,801
 <i>tomorrow night's speech</i>
 <i>from happening.</i>

364
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,233
Wh do you want?

365
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:08,200
Um... um... No.
Sorry. Sorry. Nothing.

366
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:12,434
Nothing at all.
Just... I was, uh... 

367
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,534
(humming)

368
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,233
(tool clanks loudly)

369
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,267
(sneakers squeak)

370
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,233
(breathing heavily)

371
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,167
(staple gun cocks)

372
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,100

373
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,901
(engines whirring)

374
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,467
Oh! Oh! Oh, God! Uh...

375
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,500
Uh... uh... Come on.

376
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,901
Oh! Oh, my God!
Thank God! Thank God! Listen!

377
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,267
There's a guy here,

378
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,200
and 's trying to do
something. I don't know.

379
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,700
You have to call the cops--
Security--

380
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:11,933
the guy at the front
who's checking receipts.

381
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:13,133
Uh-huh. What kind of guy?

382
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,500
Scary, kind of
a Terminator vibe.

383
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:15,467
Stubble. Red hair.

384
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,567
Black leather jacket?

385
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,867
Yes! Yes!

386
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,167
Like that guy.

387
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,333
(Muzak plays over PA)

388
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:38,667
(exasperated sigh)

389
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:54,000
Like I said, the computer
was destroyed. Beyond repair.

390
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,567
Okay. It's done.

391
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,467
I want you in the air
in an hour.

392
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,233
But what if he has
an external drive? A backup?

393
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,467
It's over, Sarah.

394
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,700
The NSA is stepping in.

395
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:08,000
Bryce was CIA, he was our guy,
and he burned us.

396
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,300
Casey's on his way out.

397
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,867
You're being recalled.

398
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,534
'Cause of Casey?

399
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:21,600
He's a burnout.

400
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:24,367
Whatever happened with Bryce,
you couldn't have known.

401
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,966
You couldn't have stopped.

402
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,500
But I can fix it.

403
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:29,200
If there's a backup,
I'll find it.

404
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,567
Just give me 12 hours.

405
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,867
I'm losing my mind.
I'm losing my mind.

406
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:39,567
(bell dings)

407
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,867
Morgan, not now.

408
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,767
Hi! Hi...

409
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,867
Uh... phone trouble again?

410
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:53,100
Uh.. yeah. I'm not sure
I'm able to receive calls,

411
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:56,267
'cause I never got one
fr you.

412
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,966
Oh, man!
She...

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,467
I had an appointment
with a realtor.

414
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,600
I just moved here.

415
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:06,634
Welcome.

416
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,367
Thanks.

417
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,300
And, uh... I don't
really know anyone here.

418
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,966
I was wowondering if
you would show me around.

419
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,133
That is,

420
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:23,200
if you're free.

421
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,333
You guys are going
to have a great time.

422
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,634
What's that, sir?

423
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,033
Xerox machines?
Yeah, I'm on it.

424
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,500
Apparently,
my schedule is wide open.

425
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:33,434
Great.

426
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:51,233
(TV playing)
Hey, Chuck.

427
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,400
Ellie, Captain.
Don't freak out.

428
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:54,801
Remain calm.

429
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,700
I have some news.

430
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,133
Chuck's got a date!

431
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,901
What? Who?

432
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,066
Way to go, Chuck.

433
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,367
That's awesome.

434
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,534
Oh, God, what are
you going to wear?

435
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,434
(rock music plays)

436
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,700
ELLIE:
 <i>So, Sarah...</i>

437
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,901
She's nice? Pretty?

438
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,434
Yeah. Actually,
Morgan met her online

439
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:20,467
in this kind
of chat room...

440
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,434
I'm totally kidding.

441
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:25,801
Try it on.
Honestly, this...

442
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,966
Hey, so, these
are left over
from the party.

443
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,066
Take those.
Oh, okay.

444
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,333
And, um, don't forget

445
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:10,367
about the old
girlfriend rule.

446
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Right, got it.
No mention of Jill.

447
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:17,367
Aces, Charles. You're aces.

448
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:20,767
A Dad quote. I'm impressed.

449
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:21,901
Love you, sis.

450
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,066
I love you. Have fun.

451
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,066
I will.

452
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,734
I'll try.

453
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,000
They just...

454
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:34,700
They grow up so fast,
you know, and...

455
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:37,867
Just go home.
Go home.

456
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,534
He's picking me up for a date.

457
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:42,200
You're on your own
on this one, Sarah.

458
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,233
I can't help you
if something goes wrong.

459
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:46,267
I don't know
about this guy, Graham.

460
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,867
Nice guys aren't sent
government secrets.

461
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,634
What should I do if he runs?

462
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,500
Kill him.

463
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,100
CHUCK:
So, yeah, I live
with my sister

464
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,700
and her boyfriend,
Captain Awesome.

465
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:18,767
No! (laughs)

466
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,734
It's true, though.

467
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:20,967
So, so, wait.

468
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,834
You call him
"Captain Awesome"?

469
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:24,300
Yeah, wait
till you meet him.

470
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,033
Everything he does is awesome:

471
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,734
climbing mountains,
jumping out of planes, flossing.

472
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,200
That's funny.

473
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,967
I'm-I'm a funny guy.

474
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:36,433
Clearly. Which is good
'cause I am not funny.

475
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:37,734
Is that your big secret,
by the way?

476
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,133
'Cause I've been
sitting here

477
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,867
trying to figure out
what's wrong with you.

478
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,700
Oh, plenty, believe me.

479
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:44,400
And I was thinking
either she's a cannibal

480
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:45,800
or she's really not that funny,

481
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:46,967
and I was pulling
for cannibal

482
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,200
'cause I never met one before.

483
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:50,233
Uh, not a cannibal,

484
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:52,634
but I did just come out
of a long relationship,

485
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,634
so I may come with baggage.

486
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,901
I could be your very own
baggage handler.

487
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,767
Uh, so the guy, the ex, the guy,

488
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,333
the ex is the reason
you moved here from...

489
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,800
Uh, D.C.
Right.

490
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,066
Yeah, after I realized

491
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,800
that all of my friends
were his friends

492
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,734
and that everything
about Washington

493
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,467
reminded me of... Bruce,

494
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,534
I needed a change, a big one.

495
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,667
Bruce... yeah.

496
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,001
You give me crap
for being Chuck

497
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,534
and you went out with a Bruce?

498
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,834
That's nice.
That's real good.

499
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,267
So, so what about you?

500
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,233
What skeletons do you have
in your closet?

501
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:33,734
Any secrets? Any women?

502
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:42,066
Uh, yeah, yeah.

503
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:48,467
Actually,
that's all over with now

504
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,700
(both laugh)

505
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:52,400
So...
I like you, Chuck.

506
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,133
So, where
are we going?

507
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,834
Well, do you like music?

508
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:03,200
I guess.

509
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,367
(laughing):
You guess?

510
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
What's your favorite band?

511
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,967
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

512
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,400
God, I'm not funny,
I don't listen to music.

513
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,300
This must be your
worst date ever, right?

514
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,500
(sirens wailing)

515
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:26,867
I was waiting
for you to say "no."

516
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,667
Sorry, sorry, I kind of
zoned out there for a second.

517
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,133
No. No, no, no.

518
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,267
God, no, I, uh, I've had...
I've had much, much worse,

519
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,200
uh, much worse dates;

520
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,934
experiences overall
with women.

521
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,267
In 11th grade, actually.

522
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,467
11th grade?

523
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,634
(laughs):
Oh, you have to go
back that far?

524
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,534
Come on.

525
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,233
I really don't
date all that much.

526
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:58,901
Chuck Bartowski's your mark.

527
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,934
NSA director wants him
with a pulse.

528
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:05,066
Till we find out
who he's working with

529
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,634
CIA skirt...
you can kill.

530
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:14,267
(both laugh)

531
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,333
(audience clamoring)

532
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,467
(indistinct singing)

533
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,333
They're good.
Good!

534
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:43,500
Good!

535
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:45,834
Let's dance!
I'm not really a dancer.

536
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,100
(gasps)

537
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,100
(men groan)

538
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,400
(grunting)

539
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,267
Hey-hey-hey,
where's the fire?

540
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,367
Chuck, give me your keys.

541
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,834
I don't mean
to be old-fashioned,

542
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,467
but the company only
wants employees--

543
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,867
nerds-- driving
the Nerd Herd-mobile.

544
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:53,734
(mechanical whirring)

545
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:54,867
Get in the car.

546
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:59,700
How did you get into my car?

547
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:00,800
Sarah...
Just get in!

548
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:02,066
What is going on?

549
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:09,500
Please tell me what's going on!

550
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,967
Sarah, you're not even looking!

551
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,800
Wait, wait, wait.

552
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:19,667
Who are these guys?
What do they want?

553
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:25,934
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I'm gonna die!

554
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,033
Tell me when to turn.

555
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:34,667
Uh, uh, left in five seconds!

556
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,400
(yelps)
Your left or my left?

557
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:38,367
What?

558
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,001
Too late!
(screams)

559
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,767
(screams):
Oh, my God!

560
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,767
Computer emergency.

561
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,567
Listen to me, Chuck.
Those men will hurt you.

562
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,233
They're from the NSA
and they're after you.

563
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,800
Me? Why, why?

564
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,534
Why me? I'm nobody.

565
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:06,734
I'm the supervisor of
a Nerd Herd at a Buy More.

566
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,433
Maybe one day I'll be
assistant store manager

567
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,567
and I don't even know
if I want that job.

568
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,567
You know,
that's not your problem...

569
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:20,400
(gasps)

570
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:23,800
Back! Back!

571
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:27,600
(gasps)
Get out of the car.

572
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:28,834
Let's go, Chuck. Move!

573
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,500
Wait, wait...

574
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,634
Sarah, look out!

575
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,367
Request emergency air-evac.

576
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,667
Track location, we're on foot.

577
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:58,867
Let's go!

578
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:04,166
How well do you know
Bryce Larkin?

579
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,033
What? How do you...
how do you know Bryce?

580
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,467
We worked together
at the CIA.

581
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,767
The what?!
The CIA?!

582
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,100
Bryce is a spy?!

583
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,600
Bryce Larkin from
Connecticut is a spy?!

584
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:13,967
A rogue spy.

585
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,534
Did he try to contact you?

586
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:18,333
I haven't heard from Bryce in...

587
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,233
Wait. No, he...

588
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,001
He-he sent,
he sent me an e-mail.

589
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,734
Did you open it?

590
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:28,667
Yeah. It was, it was
a line from <i>Zork.</i>

591
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,967
What?

592
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,333
 <i>Zork,</i> it's a video game
 that we used to play.

593
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,267
It was like a riddle,
and I solved it

594
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,367
Lots and lots of pictures.

595
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,901
You saw them?

596
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,800
Uh, your computer,
did you back it up?

597
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,133
Is there an external drive?

598
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,333
It crashed a week ago.

599
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,133
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

600
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,200
Was I not supposed
to look at those pictures?

601
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:50,634
Okay, I may have to aim
my gun at you,

602
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,767
so just don't
freak out.
Why?

603
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:57,534
It's late. I'm tired.

604
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,400
Let's cut the crap
and give him to me now.

605
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:04,300
He belongs
to the NSA.

606
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,700
(gasps)
The CIA gets him first.

607
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,001
You come any closer and I shoot.

608
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:13,233
Sarah...

609
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,800
I'm freaked out!

610
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,833
You shoot him,
I shoot you.

611
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,600
I leave both your bodies here,

612
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,167
go out
for a late snack.

613
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:28,633
I'm thinking may be pancakes.

614
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,767
Chuck, no!

615
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,700
NEWS ANCHOR:
 <i>General Stanfield,</i>
 <i>the former ally...</i>

616
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,466
 <i>...stop tomorrow night's</i>
 <i>speech from happening.</i>

617
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,767
They're gonna kill him.

618
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:51,233
Kill who?

619
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:52,600
The General Stanfield,
the NATO guy.

620
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,733
Look, something is wrong
with me, okay?

621
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,032
I don't know
what it is,

622
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,633
but something is very,
very wrong with me,

623
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,433
and I'm remembering things
that I shouldn't know.

624
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:04,233
Okay, Chuck, talk to me.
Like what?

625
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,032
I don't know. I don't know.
For example, uh...

626
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,600
there was, there was a Serbian
demolitions expert

627
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:08,633
at the Large Mart today.

628
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,400
That's kinof odd,
wouldn't you say?

629
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:13,966
Look, last week
the NSA,

630
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:16,299
blueprints of a hotel,
that hotel.

631
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:20,066
And then the CIA,
you guys found a file

632
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,633
The bomb is in that hotel!

633
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:28,032
No, he opened Bryce's e-mail.

634
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:32,166
Chuck, those pictures that you
saw were encoded with secrets,

635
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,700
government secrets.

636
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,666
If you saw them,
then you know them.

637
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,266
There were thousands of 'em.

638
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:38,966
Wait a minute.

639
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:41,233
You're telling me
all of our secrets

640
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,433
are in his head.

641
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:46,032
Chuck, <i>is</i>
the computer.

642
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,366
What did you, what did you say?
What does that mean?

643
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,099
Chuck, you have to listen to me.
You have ttell us where...

644
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:51,266
What's happening to me?!

645
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,233
You said there was a bomb.
Is there time to stop it?

646
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:55,066
What? What? Are you crazy?!

647
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:58,767
No, we're the good guys.

648
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,199
Look, I can't,
I can't help you, okay?

649
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,999
I really wish that I could,
but I can't.

650
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:04,966
Call Bryce. He's the guy
that can save the day.

651
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,233
Bryce is dead!

652
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:12,400
He died sending
those secrets to you.

653
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,700
(gunshot)

654
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:18,999
Yeah, and he's gonna
have a lot of company

655
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:20,066
unless you start talking.

656
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,466
So, pretty please...

657
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,767
can we defuse
the bomb now?

658
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,333
general's already on the stage.

659
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,133
...was our mission to give
our nation's diplomats

660
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:36,767
the military perspective
on world issues.

661
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,366
Now, maybe it was just
because I was a uniform...

662
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,433
Wait! Casey, wait!
We can't take him in.

663
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:45,833
He's too valuable.
Okay,
Johnny Commodore.

664
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:48,366
You stay here, but you
tell us where to go.

665
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,166
Uh, the easiest way?
No, fastest, Chuck.

666
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,333
The fastest. Got it.

667
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:56,133
Chuck, stop!

668
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,133
Chuck, wait!

669
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:01,299
You know, it takes courage
to speak out, to take action...

670
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,999
This way! This way!

671
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:04,233
(yelling gibberish)

672
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:05,600
This way! This way! This way!

673
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,767
...general officer
to make a political...

674
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,767
...what that means is,
we simply shouldn't do it.

675
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,600
Well, I disagree.

676
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:28,099
That's it.

677
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:29,400
It's in this...
uh, right here.

678
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:32,299
Oh, God.

679
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,566
No time to evacuate.

680
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,433
Ideas?
Disconnect the lap top.

681
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,099
There's no trigger.
The cables.

682
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,500
No, definitely
a trap.

683
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,932
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

684
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:42,899
Uh... ladies and gentlemen,

685
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,500
we-we may have a cautionary
situation here,

686
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:47,333
so we'll take a short break.

687
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:48,466
Chuck, is there
anything else

688
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,566
you remember
about the bomb?

689
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,266
MAN:
What's the situation?

690
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,366
(cell phone playing rock song)

691
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:58,066
Hi, Morgan.

692
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,566
Hey, how's it going?
Little busy right now, buddy.

693
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,500
In a good way? Details.

694
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:04,533
Why are you calling?

695
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:05,899
I don't know, just...

696
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:08,099
laying on your bed,
Ellie's with the captain.

697
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,767
My computer's got
a case of the Demovas.

698
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,500
So, I figured I'd check in.

699
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:12,700
You old...

700
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:14,666
Okay, okay, I have an idea.

701
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:16,999
That's not an XBox.

702
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,199
And you're not
in <i>X Men.</i>

703
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:19,400
I understand that.

704
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,666
This is a Prism Express
laptop, okay.

705
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,833
We sell this at our store.

706
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:27,166
It has a DOS override.

707
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,733
I think I can do this.

708
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,500
I can dohis, please.

709
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,166
He's our best shot.

710
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,166
Go.

711
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:46,166
Mr. Bomb, meet Mr. Internet.

712
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,199
He's searching for porn.

713
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:52,500
Oh, this sexy.

714
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:56,266
Oh.
Hey, sexy.

715
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:58,400
(whimpering)

716
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:06,400
You did it.

717
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:10,433
I did it.

718
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:12,867
I did it. I...

719
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,966
I defused a real bomb.

720
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,566
(laughs):
This was a real...

721
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,733
What if I was wrong?

722
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:27,066
Don't puke on the ***

723
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,367
BOTH:
He's coming with me.

724
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,666
What if this was a fluke?

725
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,000
What if he can stop
mething bigger?

726
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,599
Fine, we drop him
in a psych tank,

727
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,566
let him stare at four
rubber walls for a decade.

728
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,167
He'll tell us what
we want to know.

729
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,500
Casey, we don't know
how this works

730
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:45,766
and what triggers the memories.

731
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,866
He'll crack wide open.

732
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,966
Not my job.

733
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,566
I break things,
I don't fix them.

734
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,599
What about his job?

735
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:51,733
And his friends?

736
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:53,067
What do we do about his sister?

737
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,200
What about my sister?

738
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,633
Nothing.

739
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:57,666
We were just
discussing...

740
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:59,367
No, no, no,
hold on a second.

741
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
You have to leave my family
and my friends out of this.

742
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:03,233
We'll see.

743
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:06,866
Look, Bryce sent
that e-mail to me.

744
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,766
I'm the one remembering
your secrets.

745
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,167
Which means you have to
listen to me, both of you.

746
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,833
And right now...

747
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:15,733
I'm going to go home.

748
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:20,933
No, you're not.
Uh-uh.

749
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,633
You...

750
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:26,233
you need me.

751
00:38:36,534 --> 00:38:39,766
(music playing)

752
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,400
How long you been here?

753
00:39:02,434 --> 00:39:05,300
All night.

754
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,599
There's nowhere
I can run, is there?

755
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:09,866
Not from us.

756
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:17,800
Talk to me, Chuck.

757
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,800
Yesterday I was making
11 bucks an hour

758
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:20,966
fixing computers.

759
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,233
Now I have one in my brain.

760
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:25,566
And I can't figure out
why Bryce did this,

761
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,367
why he chose me.

762
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,100
What are you going
to do with me?

763
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:34,167
What happens now?

764
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,467
For now, you go back
to your own life.

765
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
We'll protect you and
you'll work with us.

766
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,599
And my sister, my friends,
are they in danger?

767
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:51,000
All night!
Do you know how
worried I was?

768
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,534
How far did you get?
Morgan,
shut up.

769
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:57,067
You tell them nothing
to keep them safe.

770
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,666
Early morning
procedure, so...

771
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,300
Group hug, huh?

772
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,100
Okay.

773
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,333
Awesome.

774
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:13,300
Need you to do one
more thing for me.

775
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:15,766
Yeah?

776
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,133
Trust me, Chuck.

777
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:36,699
(music playing)

778
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:57,434
Well, wish me luck.

779
00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:01,966
(dramatic music plays)

780
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:27,033
(dramatic music continues)

781
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,800
(music volume decreases)

782
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:38,599
Sorry, man.

783
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:39,733
Go get 'em.

784
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,733
Didn't think you'd apply.

785
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,966
Well, uh...

786
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,800
I think I'm ready
for this, Big Mike,

787
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:58,267
and what it means--
responsibility, decisive

788
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,400
leadership...
Save it for
the interview.

789
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,599
Now go train
the new guy.
Okeydokey.

790
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,167
(groaning)

791
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,300
(groaning)

792
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:38,500
Don't freak out.
