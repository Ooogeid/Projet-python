1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,492
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,663
When were you planning on telling me
that your mother was behind you on this?

3
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:09,570
You have today, one day.

4
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:13,737
When Burrows brings Scylla back to us,
you will be the one

5
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:15,672
to put a bullet in his brain.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,477
Naveen Banerjee, the son of
Prime Minister Nandu Banerjee.

7
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:25,448
CHRISTINA: Soon, this will all be behind
us, and maybe I can meet my grandson.

8
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:26,549
Where's Linc?!

9
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:28,351
There's an energy conference.

10
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:30,420
The Panda Bay Hotel.
He'll be there.

11
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:34,595
<i>Christina's plan... what she needed
to profit from Scylla, an incident</i>

12
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,397
that'll domino into
global warming.

13
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:38,493
No!

14
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:43,833
They rented this
in Linc's name.

15
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:45,781
Look at this. It's a setup!

16
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:47,271
His hands are all
over the shells.

17
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:50,670
<i>DOWNEY: Lincoln's right
back where he started.</i>

18
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,443
It really is too
bad about Michael.

19
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,073
We gotta go.

20
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,053
I need a doctor here!

21
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:09,123
There they are!

22
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,160
They're up there!
They're up there!

23
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:12,522
Let's go upstairs, now!

24
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:14,031
Move it, move it!

25
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:18,260
Look, let's just
blend into the crowd.

26
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:19,600
No, we can't go that way.

27
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:21,371
The door is locked, Michael.

28
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,573
Stand back.

29
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,541
This whole thing
is falling apart.

30
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:07,383
Is it?

31
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:08,493
Is it really?

32
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:10,581
What, do you think
this is funny? Huh?

33
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:13,083
How long it's gonna take before
the General sees this on the news?

34
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,622
If he thinks we can't get Scylla,
how long do you think it's gonna take

35
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:16,730
before he comes after us?

36
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,463
And then he comes
after our families?

37
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,060
Yeah, it's really funny,
isn't it?

38
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:46,852
Michael, where are you?

39
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,423
We're still in the hotel.

40
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:50,691
Is there any other way to get
out of here without being seen?

41
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,663
No, there's cops and
feds all over the place.

42
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,762
Did you get Scylla?

43
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:54,961
No.

44
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:56,393
Some guy got assassinated.

45
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,760
And guess who got
set up for it.

46
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:01,401
We need Scylla.

47
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,770
Scylla is gone!

48
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:05,391
The only thing I care about
right now is getting out of here.

49
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,002
Oh, yeah?
Where you gonna go, Michael, huh?

50
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:09,842
With the Company breathing
down our back again.

51
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:13,310
Scofield, it's Don.

52
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,380
What do you want?

53
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:15,452
To try to fix this.

54
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:16,553
How?

55
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:18,223
By stabbing us in
the back again?

56
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:19,672
Put Alex on.

57
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,771
He's a little
preoccupied right now.

58
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:24,790
Look, you want to be mad at me,
be mad at me after we get Scylla back.

59
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:25,721
Now listen to me.

60
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,691
Okay, the southwest loading dock
is a large industrial door.

61
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:30,302
It's not conducive
to a quick exit.

62
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:32,070
They only have one cop on it.

63
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,323
When you get to the door,
I can incapacitate the cop.

64
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,770
Problem is, we're on the other
side of the hotel, and they've got

65
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:37,871
the ground floor covered.

66
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,743
What else can you
see on the outside?

67
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,043
Nothing, just the cop,

68
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:43,582
a couple of Dumpsters,
jack pallets and some laundry bins.

69
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,310
That must mean the on-site laundry's
on the other side of the hotel,

70
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:48,980
near the loading dock door.

71
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:51,452
If we get to the laundry,
we can get to the door.

72
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,822
You said we can't make
it across the hotel.

73
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,303
But we can get
access to the roof.

74
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,222
Hotels use rooftop ventilation,

75
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:00,790
so the hotel guests don't
smell the laundry fumes.

76
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,613
Okay, so, listen,
take the ventilation system

77
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,633
to the laundry room;
if you can get to the laundry room,

78
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,132
you're gonna get
right by the door.

79
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:12,033
Put me on speaker.

80
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,242
Alex, you want to get The
Company off our backs?

81
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,812
Go to 4 Dunn Place.

82
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,742
Sara's holding my mother there.

83
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,852
Make her tell us
where Scylla is.

84
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,760
And clear our
names in all this.

85
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:29,823
You need to do whatever you gotta
do to get her to talk, you hear me?

86
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:30,992
Do whatever you gotta do.

87
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:32,951
Got it.

88
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:35,863
Come on.

89
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:10,203
It is complete mayhem at the Panda
Bay Hotel where Naveen Banerjee,

90
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,103
the son of India's Prime Minister,
has been assassinated.

91
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:15,132
Amazingly, there have
been unconfirmed reports

92
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,340
identifying the assailants
as none other than

93
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:20,591
Lincoln Burrows, suspected of
murdering Terrence Steadman,

94
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,071
and Michael Scofield,
his mastermind brother...

95
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,511
Christina sandbagged all of us!

96
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,152
If the brothers are caught,
we have no control over what

97
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:31,922
they might say to
the authorities.

98
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:35,721
Get down to that hotel and make sure
they don't have that opportunity.

99
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:39,221
Uh, General, I'd be more than
willing to take on that assignment.

100
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,533
And I assure you I will
dispatch of it efficiently.

101
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:44,362
This is not an Alabama
coon hunt, Teddy.

102
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,402
Don't judge me by
desperate actions

103
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:48,631
I've taken when there's
been a gun to my head.

104
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:50,272
I ran an entire prison
gang syndicate.

105
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:54,042
Hardened felons called me "Mister."
I'm so much more than a snitch.

106
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:55,910
And if you continue
to treat me as such,

107
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,733
it will be your loss,
General, not mine.

108
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:04,552
Son, I have the fate of a multi-trillion
dollar enterprise in my hands,

109
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:09,602
and you want me to let you
earn your stripes now?!

110
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:13,362
Take care of the brothers.

111
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,571
Here we go! Here we go!

112
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:26,941
This should be it.

113
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:31,741
Perfect.

114
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,610
They say ours should
be here shortly.

115
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:39,953
I want you guys on full alert
and get all geared up, all right?

116
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,022
It's them!

117
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:42,692
Stop!

118
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:04,840
They could be on any floor.

119
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:06,300
Can you override
the door locks?

120
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,781
Yeah, they're electronic.

121
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,983
We control everything
from down here.

122
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:12,652
I want every room in this
hotel locked down now!

123
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,720
Why don't we just take
the stairs to the roof?

124
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:20,692
Because we'll set
off the fire alarm.

125
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:23,261
The ducts in the crawl spaces
above these top floor rooms,

126
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,903
that's how we get
our rooftop access.

127
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:30,032
Once we find the laundry vent,
we take that down to the loading dock.

128
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,341
That should do it.

129
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:57,700
Go! Go!
(garbled radio transmission)

130
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:06,642
What's going on?

131
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,141
(beeps) They locked us out.

132
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:10,380
We can't get to the roof.

133
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,392
Let's head back down.

134
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,010
There'll be cops
in the stairwell.

135
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,352
We can't go up,
we can't go down...

136
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:18,393
We're trapped.

137
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,810
There has been a new development
in the Panda Bay assassination.

138
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:30,582
An anonymous source has provided FOX
with documents showing a wire transfer

139
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,452
from Chinese operatives
to Burrows and Scofield.

140
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:37,090
The fallout from this from a
geopolitical standpoint is staggering.

141
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:38,822
Relations between
China and India...

142
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,963
Nandu reached out.

143
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:43,450
He wants to meet with you.

144
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,735
This couldn't have
worked out better.

145
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,867
Nice audible on the
Chinese document.

146
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,133
Thank you.

147
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,902
Now we just...

148
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,073
watch the dominoes
begin to fall.

149
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:59,232
I just wish they weren't
falling on Michael.

150
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:04,852
Christina, you gave him options,
he made his choice, he picked his side.

151
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,921
Yes, but he is my son.

152
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:15,092
My only son.

153
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,960
And right now it is believed
both Burrows and Scofield

154
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:21,733
are still in the hotel, but it
appears the police are closing in.

155
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,801
Live just outside the
Panda Bay Hotel...

156
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,172
No, no, no, you see,
that's the problem, Michael.

157
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,413
There's cops everywhere.

158
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:32,272
It's like a freaking
cop anthill out here.

159
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,282
Look, it's just a matter of
time till they find you anyway.

160
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,412
Find out what their
plan of attack is.

161
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:38,913
Sure, you know what?

162
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,283
Yeah, I'll just go up and ask them,
all right?

163
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,093
They look like a
real friendly bunch.

164
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,290
We don't have much time,
so get it done now!

165
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,761
Burrows and Scofield could
be armed to the teeth.

166
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,190
It's tight quarters
in the stairwell,

167
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,660
so I don't want a lot of shooting,
all right?

168
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,702
This guy's from
Homeland Security.

169
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:57,603
I'll file my report as soon as
I've apprehended the shooters.

170
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,842
Whoa, whoa,
let me be clear here, Captain.

171
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,941
The shooting that happened today
wasn't your typical gangbanger,

172
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:05,112
public service killing you're
used to here in Miami.

173
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:08,082
This was an international
assassination with ramifications

174
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:10,311
that directly affect the
security of this country.

175
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:12,011
So, if you turn your
back on me again,

176
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:14,383
I'll jam you up for hindering
a federal investigation.

177
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,622
You understand?

178
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,620
Fine.

179
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:20,802
But I want you on my hip.

180
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:23,693
I'm not gonna have you running
around playing weekend warrior

181
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,360
so you can go back to your
buddies at the office

182
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,300
and tell them you saw some
real gun play, understood?

183
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:28,401
Not a problem.

184
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:31,733
Now, why don't you start by telling me
how you're gonna diffuse the situation?

185
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:34,203
We're gonna gas them out floor
by floor until we find them.

186
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:36,403
Whoa, hold on there, Tex.
If you use gas you're gonna

187
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:38,243
compromise visibility
,and I can't afford

188
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,081
another diplomat
getting shot in the fez.

189
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:41,711
We're using chloropropane.

190
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,483
It's colorless, it's odorless.

191
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,080
They won't even
know what hit them.

192
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,251
All right, listen up.

193
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,520
I want two men in the east
stairwell with the gas,

194
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,891
two at the base of the west stairwell in
case they try to come back down again.

195
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,691
I'll have backup detail ready,
all right?

196
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,662
Let's go, move, move!

197
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,222
Sara?

198
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:32,033
Oh, my God.

199
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,363
Sara.

200
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:36,591
Sara, you hurt? You okay?

201
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,242
I'm fine. Christina's gone.

202
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,301
There's a knife in
the last drawer.

203
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,140
Do you have any idea
where she went?

204
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,772
No.

205
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,292
She has Scylla.

206
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,313
She set up Linc and Michael.

207
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:53,423
She could be anywhere.

208
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:54,633
<i>Michael and Lincoln?</i>

209
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:57,412
Yeah, they were framed for the
murder of an Indian official.

210
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:58,673
It's all over the news.

211
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:00,651
That was Christina's
plan, and...

212
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:01,720
Where are they now?

213
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,162
They're trapped at
the Panda Bay Hotel.

214
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:05,963
The police are
looking for them.

215
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:07,262
Okay.

216
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:09,162
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't go there.

217
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:11,571
The cops are everywhere.
I really need you to get out of my way.

218
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:12,902
Well, that's not gonna happen.

219
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,572
You don't care for me,
I don't care for you

220
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:20,781
much either,
but I owe Michael, okay? Run.

221
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:23,471
He's in a sea of trouble right now.
I'm not abandoning him.

222
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,351
I'm not telling you to abandon him.
There's nothing you can do for him.

223
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,480
Listen, I'd run if I could run.

224
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:31,650
But if I run, they go after my wife,
so I have to jump back in.

225
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:32,701
You don't.

226
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,222
I'm not running.

227
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:41,400
I'll stay here, okay?

228
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,232
That way,
Michael knows where I am.

229
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:46,242
So does Christina.

230
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,670
If she wanted me dead,
I would be already.

231
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:50,511
Suit yourself.

232
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,211
Alex?

233
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:57,582
Thanks.

234
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,082
And if you see Michael,
tell him I'm here.

235
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:01,580
Yeah.

236
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:07,991
<i>I know how difficult
this must be for you.</i>

237
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:13,030
Mr. Prime Minister, I, too,
lost a son when he was just a child.

238
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:17,100
Was your son murdered by
an assailant's bullet?

239
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,471
Of course not.

240
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:25,013
I've heard the news that
the Chinese are behind this.

241
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:28,443
Yes, I've heard that as well.

242
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:29,852
And that's why I'm here.

243
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,850
Not to discuss how my son died,
but how to avenge him.

244
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:41,521
Your technology-- as you put it-- I've
heard rumors of its varied applications.

245
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,392
Nandu, let's take
a breath here.

246
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:49,402
No! The time to take a breath
expired when my son died.

247
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:55,841
Your son and I had planned to use the
technology for humanitarian endeavors.

248
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:58,572
Warfare applications
were not our goal.

249
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:01,421
But now they are mine,
and at the end of the day,

250
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:04,582
you're a businesswoman with
a product and I am a buyer.

251
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:08,480
I want to commit to all the
intellectual property you possess.

252
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:13,591
I want the People's Republic of China
to feel the pain I feel right now!

253
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:21,803
Do you comprehend the ramifications
of what it is you're proposing?

254
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,970
More than you know.

255
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:35,010
If it is what you want.

256
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,512
I must go now...

257
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:46,690
to make arrangements for your payment
and arrangements for my child's burial.

258
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:18,650
Yeah?

259
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:20,310
Congratulations. You're
famous again.

260
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:22,391
You're all over the news
for killing Gandhi.

261
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,160
I figured as much.

262
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,230
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

263
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,162
They're gonna gas
you out. When?

264
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,202
They already started.
They're going floor-by-floor.

265
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:32,031
They're about at the third
or fourth floor right now.

266
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:34,303
Why are you just telling
me about this now?

267
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:35,771
I had to leave the lobby.

268
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,420
I can't make anybody
more suspicious.

269
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,883
Hello, Michael? Michael?

270
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:50,620
Linc, I need your help.

271
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,190
When I was in fourth grade,

272
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:55,390
I... I got an A for guessing
all the answers on this test.

273
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,900
I never thought I'd
beat those odds.

274
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:02,360
What kind of loser gets set up

275
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:07,041
for two high-profile
assassinations within five years?

276
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:09,151
Are you kidding?
This is not your fault.

277
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:12,293
If they didn't get away with it then,
they're not gonna get away with it now.

278
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:14,193
But I need you to focus.

279
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,483
I need your help, Linc.

280
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:24,922
Right. Let's get out of here.

281
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:32,293
601-30 on Tac Two.

282
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:33,800
Darrin Hooks,
Homeland Security.

283
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,903
Can you point me to
whoever's in charge here?

284
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,803
Homeland? How many of you
guys are they sending here?

285
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:40,402
Agent Self's already inside.

286
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:41,671
Who?

287
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:43,172
Agent Don Self.

288
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:45,013
Got here a little while ago.

289
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,353
Yeah, it's Hooks.

290
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:58,072
The name of that agent that was
supposedly killed recently in L.A.?

291
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,491
Was his name Don Self?

292
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:09,441
It's all falling out exactly
as Christina planned it.

293
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:14,141
Now she's going to have
everything she ever hoped for.

294
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:18,970
She's trying to reignite the
1962 China-India Border War which

295
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:23,513
ended in an uneasy truce when neither
country could withstand the losses

296
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,551
they were sustaining in those
remote and desolate mountains.

297
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:32,153
If she succeeds in provoking
another war, and framing China

298
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,291
for the killing of India's
Prime Minister's son,

299
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:36,091
it's certainly
provocation enough.

300
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:40,130
She'll set off a military conflict
that will last for decades

301
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:41,662
that may never be resolved.

302
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:43,912
Why didn't you do it yourself?

303
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:49,171
Power, money,
seem to be things you love.

304
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:52,572
Because if India's involved,
that drags in Pakistan.

305
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:54,642
Then Russia's gonna want
to defend its borders.

306
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:58,510
Then within a year, Europe's in it
and after that, the United States.

307
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,253
It's an apocalypse in
which everyone loses!

308
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:07,790
And Christina has always been too
prideful and too unstable to accept it.

309
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:36,851
Got it.

310
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:44,560
Can I help you?

311
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:48,403
Hi. Yes, I think you can.

312
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:58,510
Agent Self.

313
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,952
Donald Self?

314
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,723
Agent Darrin Hooks.

315
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:23,062
It's good to see you.

316
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:25,631
It's good to see you, too.

317
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:37,352
Hold it. Hold it right there.
Don't move.

318
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:41,180
What the hell are
you doing, Hooks?

319
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:42,952
You always pull guns
on fellow agents?

320
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,623
Yeah, when agents that
are supposedly dead

321
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,462
and are found later in a hotel
with the guys that killed him.

322
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:52,630
You mind telling me what you're
doing here with Burrows and Scofield?

323
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:54,901
My cover called for
me to be dead, okay?

324
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,473
People were catching on to what we
were doing, and my death freed me up

325
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:01,600
But Burrows and Scofield
have been set up, okay?

326
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:03,801
There's no record of
you in covert ops.

327
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:04,772
That was by design.

328
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:07,641
Look, when this is all over,
we'll call the home office,

329
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:10,433
I'll punch in my clearance code,
you can buy me a couple of drinks,

330
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:12,512
and we'll share some
laughs about this.

331
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:15,052
But right now I need
to do my damn job.

332
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,691
No.

333
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:20,890
You're gonna follow and we're
gonna clear this up right now.

334
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:27,533
Okay, but what I said about
Scofield and Burrows is true.

335
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:28,762
They've been set up.

336
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,100
You need to look into this.

337
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:33,272
Oh, I'm gonna look into everything
as soon as we get outside.

338
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:34,570
Let's go.

339
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,973
Did you clear the
loading dock doors?

340
00:21:43,147 --> 00:21:45,570
No, but someone else did.

341
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:47,273
What do you mean?

342
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,600
Someone must've taken him out.

343
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:50,281
Which means there's
someone in the hotel

344
00:21:50,387 --> 00:21:52,181
other than the police
that's looking for you.

345
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:55,080
Linc, we got to move.

346
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,381
Got more than just
the cops after us now.

347
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,051
Whoa, whoa.
You know what you're doing?

348
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,162
No.

349
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:08,862
Let's go.

350
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:13,972
Captain Hutchinson!

351
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,370
We've got a room breach on 16.

352
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:18,172
This is Hutchinson.

353
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:19,611
Scofield and Burrows are on 16.

354
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:21,980
I repeat,
Scofield and Burrows are on 16.

355
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:23,983
Go, go, go!

356
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:25,310
Move, move, move!

357
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,363
This way.

358
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:41,231
Make sure the door can shut.

359
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,633
We need the pressure to build.

360
00:22:57,316 --> 00:22:59,482
They're coming. They're coming!

361
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:16,161
We're on 16.

362
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:17,431
Copy that.

363
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:18,872
On my mark.

364
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:21,002
Go.

365
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,853
Backup detail!

366
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:05,712
Move! Go, go, go, go!

367
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:08,321
Move, move, move! Go, move!

368
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,251
Move, move!

369
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:12,621
What the hell happened?

370
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:13,992
They booby-trapped us.

371
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:15,492
They made a move for the roof.

372
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:17,090
All right,
get them to a hospital.

373
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,073
All right. Let's go!
Move, move, move!

374
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,953
Stop right there!

375
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,752
Don't make a move for
that weapon, Burrows.

376
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:45,293
Take the masks off.

377
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:47,392
Take them off now!

378
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,090
Hands behind your head.

379
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:56,870
You'd better pray to God that
my men are found out all right.

380
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:58,303
It was a concussive blast.

381
00:24:58,477 --> 00:24:59,670
They're just unconscious.

382
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,441
Shut up. (gunshot)

383
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:04,673
Easy!

384
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,683
Easy.

385
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:09,683
And I'd follow that advice
about not going for your guns.

386
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:14,523
The General would like
you back at the office.

387
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:17,651
Now.

388
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:38,252
Did all go well at the hotel?

389
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:41,251
(whispers): What's going on
with Sara and my mother?

390
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:42,733
Christina escaped.

391
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:44,340
Sara's okay.

392
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:45,851
She's in the condo.

393
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:50,383
Excuse me, would you boys like
a little alone time to catch up?

394
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,173
What exactly do
you expect from us?

395
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:55,362
You need to take responsibility
for your failures.

396
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:56,960
Hey, we failed nothing.

397
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,342
This whole thing was a setup.

398
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:01,581
You know it.
Lincoln Burrows was outsmarted.

399
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:03,782
Who could have
anticipated that?

400
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:11,913
I think you need to
accept that this is over.

401
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:20,062
I've been holding a
chip for far too long.

402
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:22,103
It's time to play it.

403
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:25,670
I made you boys a promise.

404
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:31,503
You would find Scylla and I
would see to it you got some cash

405
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:33,900
and had the slate wiped clean.

406
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,912
I intend to keep that promise.

407
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:38,942
However, if I keep one promise,

408
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,032
I have to keep them all.

409
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,052
Now...

410
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:47,340
I wonder who the
big winner will be.

411
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:51,031
Don't do this. Don't do what?

412
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:54,790
When I sent you those envelopes,
I wasn't just playing games.

413
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:58,191
I made it very clear
that you had one day

414
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,352
to accomplish your job,
or there would be

415
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:02,613
consequences.

416
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:03,870
What's that?

417
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,432
The consequence.

418
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:07,701
Call our man in Queens.

419
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,740
Queens? What are you
calling New York for?

420
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,381
Put it on speaker, please.

421
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:16,820
MAN (on phone): Yes.
Move on subject four.

422
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:18,152
I'm a block away.

423
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,422
ETA is less than two minutes.

424
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:21,621
You son of a bitch.

425
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:23,442
You son of a bitch!

426
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,593
My wife is a defenseless woman.

427
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:28,723
Mr. Self didn't inform you
that he had a wife, did he?

428
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,892
Well, I wouldn't talk about my wife
either if I'd had a few too many

429
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:35,603
bourbons, got behind the wheel,
and turned a beautiful young woman

430
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,513
into a piece of broccoli.

431
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:38,583
Don't do anything.

432
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:42,171
I assume that is why you
tried to run away with Scylla?

433
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:45,443
To screw a government that was giving
you benefits that would only pay

434
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:50,651
for a county facility overlooking
the Belt Parkway, and to sell it

435
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:55,750
so that you and she could
disappear and be hidden forever.

436
00:27:56,838 --> 00:27:58,102
C'est la vie.

437
00:27:58,227 --> 00:27:59,763
I have the subject in sights.

438
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,421
She's in a wheelchair under a
tree in the hospital courtyard.

439
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,460
Do I have a go?

440
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:04,550
Please don't do this.

441
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:07,291
Okay, please, you can kill me,
okay, you can kill me

442
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,213
right now, please, kill me.

443
00:28:09,335 --> 00:28:11,093
You don't need to do this;
we'll get Scylla.

444
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:13,601
That's what I wanted to hear.
Well, that's what we're trying to do!

445
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:15,871
We're getting it.
But you have to know what awaits you

446
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:18,723
and your loved
ones if you don't.

447
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:20,293
We understand, okay?

448
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:22,042
Execute the order.
Please don't do it!

449
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:25,680
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

450
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:28,082
Get help, hel--!
(line disconnects)

451
00:28:32,725 --> 00:28:35,173
I believe you made a request.

452
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:07,092
GENERAL: Bagwell,
make sure he's dead.

453
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:10,101
Does everyone understand now?

454
00:29:13,106 --> 00:29:16,072
Are we all on the same page?

455
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,700
Good.

456
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,213
Let's get down to business.

457
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:28,173
Three-quarters of a billion
dollars in a numerical account

458
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:30,652
in Luxembourg.
If you are still worried about

459
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:35,403
humanitarian efforts,
write a check to UNICEF.

460
00:29:37,955 --> 00:29:40,930
All the data will be
delivered within 24 hours.

461
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:43,020
That's what I expected.

462
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:52,170
You played it perfectly.

463
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:58,381
Reach out to our
contact in China.

464
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,850
I have a feeling they may be interested
in what we're selling as well.

465
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:10,223
Christina, I don't advise
playing both sides of this coin.

466
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:13,150
Pigs get fat and hogs
get slaughtered.

467
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:23,971
Reach out to China.

468
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,412
GENERAL: No! Keep our people

469
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,160
<i>at every private airfield
in Florida and in Georgia.</i>

470
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:42,681
We can't have Christina
leaving the state.

471
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:46,523
She played on India's emotions,
which probably means she'd want to meet

472
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:49,331
with one of their emissaries today
while they're still running hot.

473
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,663
She could still be in Miami,
maybe at the embassy.

474
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,632
No, she's not at the embassy.

475
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:57,303
Any deal she makes with India
will be strictly off the radar.

476
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,531
Right now she's concerned
with two things.

477
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:03,731
One is closing the deal on Scylla,
which I'm assuming she's already done,

478
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:05,563
and the second is getting paid.

479
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:07,193
No sign of Self.

480
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:11,040
How much can she
get for Scylla?

481
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,913
Half a billion from India,
the same from China.

482
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,140
Overseas account?

483
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:16,440
Foreign wire transfer?

484
00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:18,861
I doubt she's taking
any food stamps.

485
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:23,103
She's going to want confirmation
that that money is safely overseas

486
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:25,091
before she leaves the U.S.

487
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:26,920
We find the money,

488
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:29,202
we find my mother.

489
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,692
Normally it takes
three business days

490
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:35,961
for an international wire transfer
to clear, unless the bank is

491
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,631
a Federal Reserve signatory,
in which case the transfer is immediate.

492
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:41,152
You think she'll
head to the bank?

493
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,810
All she has to do is withdraw
a few grand from the millions

494
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:47,421
that that buyer has probably
transferred overseas already.

495
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,061
She'll know it's all there.

496
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:52,373
So let's find a Federal Reserve
signatory bank in Miami.

497
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:54,221
We'll have a shot
at finding her.

498
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:55,533
And Scylla.

499
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:58,893
There, Michael, you see,
that's why I didn't put

500
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:00,232
your name in the bowl.

501
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:02,570
You're the only one here
that's irreplaceable.

502
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:05,870
Agents, informants, muscle--
they're nice to have, but...

503
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:07,440
finally they're replaceable.

504
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:10,010
There's a branch
about 20 minutes away.

505
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:13,521
That mind of yours--
it's one in a million.

506
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:15,872
Nice to see it finally
working for me.

507
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,212
I do not work for you.

508
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,423
Not yet.

509
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:37,451
It's legitimate, I assure you.

510
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,282
Oh, okay.

511
00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:42,841
I just want to withdraw the
$10,000 so I can be sure

512
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:45,823
the Luxembourg account
is properly set up.

513
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,421
Well.

514
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:07,513
Is she in there?

515
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,181
Yeah, I saw her
through the window.

516
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:11,482
She's talking to a tall,
dark-haired guy.

517
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,781
They're the same guys who
set us up at the hotel.

518
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:16,651
We wait until she comes out, just jump.
MAHONE: So...

519
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:18,170
what do we do
about her security?

520
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:20,593
I mean, we jump her,
we gotta jump the guys she's with,

521
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,370
and God knows how many other
agents are gonna come crawling

522
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:25,313
out of the woodwork like ants.

523
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:31,370
Look, um...
I hate to bring up the obvious,

524
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:35,411
but last time I checked, you two still
disagreed as to what to do with Scylla

525
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:37,121
if we actually get it.

526
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:42,112
Yeah, that's what I thought.

527
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,782
Well, let's skip the damn thing.
I mean, who's gonna stop us?

528
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:46,043
A 17-year-old security guard?

529
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,922
No, probably the
guy with the gun.

530
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:51,090
He'll open fire as soon
as he sees our faces.

531
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:56,762
Then, uh...
maybe they shouldn't see our faces.

532
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:02,070
So then the pizza guy showed up,
and Wayne jumped out of the bushes

533
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:03,971
and tried to grab the pizza,
but the...

534
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,540
but the guy...

535
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:08,971
My God.

536
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:15,681
Are you okay, mister?

537
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,413
(weakly): Yeah.

538
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:19,553
Go call 911.

539
00:34:19,728 --> 00:34:20,761
Go, go. No.

540
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:22,982
No, don't call anyone.

541
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,991
Okay?

542
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:26,923
Don't call anybody.

543
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:29,693
Don't call anyone.

544
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:37,530
You know, once baby brother's got his
little hands on that magic box of yours,

545
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,803
I don't think it's going
to be too hard for him

546
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,270
to trick Magilla Gorilla,
if you know what I'm saying.

547
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,342
No, I don't.

548
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,490
And you really think that Scofield's
going to risk his nephew's life?

549
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:51,483
He'll figure out something before he
hands first prize over to the bad guys.

550
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,940
Scofield thinks pure,
like a little Cub Scout.

551
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:56,403
Burrows, he just
thinks like a cub.

552
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:58,691
He's right.

553
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:01,791
I don't feel comfortable having Scofield
out there with something I want

554
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:04,031
while I'm stuck here
with nothing he wants.

555
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:05,792
I need leverage.

556
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:10,502
You saw the way Mahone pulled Scofield
over when they first got here.

557
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,431
Bet you a wooden nickel
they was talking

558
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:15,772
about little Dr.
Underpants and her whereabouts.

559
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,941
Too bad we don't
know where that is.

560
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,771
Wrong again, Curly.

561
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:22,283
While everyone was up
here flapping their gums,

562
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,653
I took the liberty of toddling
down to Mahone's car,

563
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:28,280
checking out the last
address he put in his GPS.

564
00:35:30,156 --> 00:35:33,521
There's a gambler's chance
we might find the leverage

565
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,691
you're looking for right here.

566
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:36,790
I'm on it.

567
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:38,290
No.

568
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:46,632
You wanted to get in on the action,
here's your chance.

569
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:54,882
Okay, I'll just count
this out for you.

570
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:56,982
That won't be necessary.

571
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,051
All righty.

572
00:35:59,218 --> 00:36:02,820
A printed record of your transaction,
and I think a balance that high

573
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:05,991
are you sure you don't want to talk
to one of our investment specialists?

574
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:07,821
No, thank you.

575
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,362
Everybody down on the ground!

576
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:14,161
Now! Nobody
move,nobody gets hurt.

577
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:16,161
You, down.

578
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:19,000
What are the odds?

579
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:23,201
Don't.

580
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:32,311
The case.

581
00:36:34,387 --> 00:36:36,533
I'll take that.

582
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,590
Hi, Mom.

583
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:59,873
Scofield and Burrows
leaving the bank, now!

584
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,561
Take Scylla and go!

585
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,662
We gotta stay together!

586
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:19,460
I said go!

587
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,963
Come on!

588
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:52,930
I think he's out.

589
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:53,962
Move in.

590
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,302
Move in.

591
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,631
After today's events, how much egg does
the U.S. court system have on its face

592
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,441
for exonerating Lincoln Burrow?

593
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,982
in the first place. An omelet's worth,
Paula. If you remember

594
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:10,290
I was never in favor
of the exoneration.

595
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:14,150
Lincoln Burrows is a thug for hire,
and his little brother is no better.

596
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:18,773
I'm amazed that the court system
just glossed over the warning signs.

597
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:14,143
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

598
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:16,151
Easy now, Doc, easy.

599
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,150
It's just your friendly,
neighborhood T-Bag.

600
00:39:18,328 --> 00:39:20,183
Now I'm gonna need
your cooperation.

601
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,403
Get your hands off me,
you son of a... Hand,

602
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:39,102
not hands,
thanks to your boyfriend.

603
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:42,741
Now, as I was saying before,
I just need your cooperation.

604
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:02,281
All right.

605
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:04,763
All right.

606
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,760
He's taking too long.

607
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,770
Something's wrong.

608
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:09,940
We gotta go back for him.

609
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:11,233
He said he'd catch up.

610
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:13,372
No, something's wrong.

611
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,170
Call him.

612
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:18,273
Call him.

613
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:25,152
Michael,

614
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:31,020
now that we have this, what the
hell are we going to do with it?

615
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:39,560
He's not answering.

616
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,730
Linc?

617
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:46,403
I heard about the bank
robbery on the radio.

618
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:50,383
You boys just can't stand to
be out of the news, can you?

619
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:52,841
I assume you've got Scylla?

620
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,340
We're getting close.

621
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:55,810
We'll keep you posted.

622
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,982
I wouldn't hang up just
yet if I were you, son.

623
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:03,340
Michael, we're in
the apartment.

624
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:06,143
I know you have it.

625
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:09,912
Otherwise, Christina would never
have risked a public shootout.

626
00:41:10,038 --> 00:41:14,203
Now, I'm going to make this
easy for you, bring me Scylla,

627
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:17,571
or this time,
Sara's death will not be faked.

628
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,112
What is it?

629
00:41:27,815 --> 00:41:29,881
What is it?

630
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:35,031
The General has Sarah.

631
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:43,773
Take it.

632
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,530
I swear if you touch her...

633
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,703
Hello, son.

634
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:59,011
I believe you have
something I want.

635
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:02,751
And I have something you want-- although
I'll never really understand why.

636
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:06,322
All right,
maybe we can work something out.

637
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:11,223
I gave you the opportunity
to work something out.

638
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:14,322
You rejected me, Michael.

639
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:16,100
Look, let's meet
and talk about this.

640
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:18,373
Now the time for talking
passed about the time

641
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:20,400
you put those ski masks on,
don't you think?

642
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,773
So, here's what I'm
going to do, Michael.

643
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm going to shoot Lincoln
through the right rib cage,

644
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:30,752
just grazing the lower
quadrant of his right lung.

645
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:34,642
It will slowly collapse,
making it very difficult to breathe.

646
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:37,743
If he doesn't get medical attention,
within five hours,

647
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:39,262
he'll be dead.

648
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,493
Christina... Mom... please

649
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,413
Linc!

650
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:55,402
Second hand's
spinning, Michael.

651
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,573
Looks like you have a
little decision to make.

652
00:42:57,697 --> 00:43:01,393
Scylla or someone you love.
