<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,370
I'm breaking out,

3
00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:05,002
and you're going to make sure
my brother goes with me.

4
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:06,128
I'm sorry, Henry.

5
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,483
This message is for Maricruz.

6
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:13,283
I'll be there in the airport
in Ixtapa waiting for you.

7
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:14,941
Sucre, down the road,

8
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:17,249
if you're in trouble, post a note
on the message board.

9
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:18,382
What's it called?

10
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,441
Europeangoldfinch.net

11
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:21,931
That's a bird, right?

12
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,175
Go pack your things.

13
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:25,853
We're moving

14
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:27,430
We will be a family

15
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,961
if it kills us.

16
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,915
<i>Pull this off
and you're halfway home.</i>

17
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,714
You remember what home is like,
don't you?

18
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,319
Stay away from my family!

19
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,855
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

20
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:42,413
I don't feel good.

21
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:43,585
Oh, sweetie...

22
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:45,756
Michael, I want for this to be over.

23
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:46,810
That makes two of us.

24
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:49,494
It's just a question of knowing
at what your father gave you.

25
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:50,495
It's just a key

26
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:54,075
It's locked in a box
inside that cigar club.

27
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:57,499
I'm not a wanted fugitive.
Give me the key. I'll do it.

28
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,020
You want to take a walk?

29
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,145
Miss Tancredi?

30
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:33,419
I need to have a word with you.

31
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,372
Miss Tancredi?

32
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:44,578
Of course.

33
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,149
It's time to go.

34
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,645
They're going out the back.

35
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:13,820
Come on, come on.

36
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:31,736
Pediatrics, please.

37
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,003
<i>Cameron.</i>

38
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:38,104
Hi, Dad

39
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,306
How are you doing, big guy?

40
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:40,836
<i>Good. I'm eating my lunch.</i>

41
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:41,907
How is it?

42
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:43,371
Pretty disgusting.

43
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:47,469
Maybe your mom can bring you
some dinner from home.

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,824
Did you see the doctor today?

45
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:51,173
<i>Yeah. He said I can go home this week</i>

46
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:53,687
<i>as long as I stay out of the street.</i>

47
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:56,670
You're a smart young man.
You know how to cross the street.

48
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,213
Are you mad at me?

49
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:01,137
Listen to me.

50
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:05,635
No one is mad at you.

51
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,240
And this wasn't your fault.

52
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:10,505
I'm the one who should have been
looking out for you.

53
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,858
You weren't even there.

54
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:14,255
But I should have been.

55
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,945
Aw, man.
Hey, buddy, listen. I got to go,

56
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,546
but I'll call you back later, okay?

57
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:21,723
Okay. Bye.

58
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,021
I love you.

59
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,859
What have we got on Franklin?

60
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:34,604
Nothing new since this morning.

61
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:37,642
Another witness from the Minnesota
diner robbery gave a positive I. D.

62
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,405
Good. 'Cause I just landed
in Minneapolis 15 minutes ago.

63
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,833
- Anything else?
<i>- Yeah. The girl. Dede.</i>

64
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:45,889
Apparently, she's been ill,
some chronic condition.

65
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,380
Fax Franklin's mug shot
to every hospital

66
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:49,611
in southeastern Minnesota.

67
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,791
Already done. With any luck,

68
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:55,420
she'll get sick enough to need one,
then he'll show his face.

69
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:58,129
You don't have kids, do you, Lang?

70
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,291
Nope.

71
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,269
Call me when you have something else.

72
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:04,402
I'll take that.

73
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:12,417
- We didn't get it.
- What?

74
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,181
And we need to get back in there soon.

75
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,072
Once the Company finds out
Sara was in there,

76
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,826
it won't be long
before they start wondering why.

77
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,306
Find a spot close to the club
and sit tight.

78
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:22,464
We're going to take the car.

79
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,875
- We'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Where you going?

80
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:28,068
Turns out that maybe there's one member
of that club who can help us.

81
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:29,196
Who?

82
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,794
Pope?

83
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:34,549
Just a minute.

84
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,711
Henry.

85
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,565
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,870
Aside from jumping bail
and evading the authorities?

87
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:47,553
There's something that you need to hear,

88
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,450
but, first,
I need to know if you'll listen.

89
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,727
I can assure you, Sara,
we've got nothing to discuss.

90
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,129
Sir, please. I need five minutes.

91
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,047
After that, if you want us to,
we'll leave.

92
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,205
Who's "us"?

Transcript : swsub.com

94
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:36,569
I don't want any trouble.

95
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,498
Good. Because that's not why we're here.

96
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,542
What the hell are you thinking about,

97
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:42,716
waltzing in here?
You're a wanted criminal!

98
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,536
In case you've forgotten,
I dedicated my career-- my entire life--

99
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:48,764
to keeping people like you behind bars.

100
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:50,113
You're talking about guilty people.

101
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,407
My brother is innocent.

102
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:53,379
And we may have the evidence
to prove it.

103
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:54,726
I want you out of here.

104
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,822
It's in a lockbox
at the Corona del Oro club,

105
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,172
and you're a member.

106
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:01,445
- Out!
- Henry, please listen.

107
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:05,017
Sara, I'm tempted to say
you should have known better.

108
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,873
But after what you did...

109
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:09,642
My father was looking into
the Burrows case when he was murdered.

110
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,198
This key is the only thing
I could recover from his body.

111
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,585
Where are we going?

112
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,487
They're hungry.

113
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,026
We've been driving all day.

114
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:40,939
Chick-O-Stick.

115
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:44,168
They need real food.

116
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,490
Soon enough, pumpkin.

117
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,746
Alackaday.

118
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,660
Miscreants. Defilers.

119
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:09,550
Defacers.

120
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:11,684
Despoilers.

121
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,266
What is this?

122
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,021
My home.

123
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,190
Por favor, please, please.

124
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,770
All right, sweetie,
why don't you sit over here, okay?

125
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:25,863
All right.

126
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,826
I'm going to go over there
and I'm going to talk to the lady.

127
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,465
All right? You need anything?

128
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:32,183
You sure?

129
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,185
Okay.

130
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:39,947
Yes?

131
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:42,399
My daughter, Dede, she's really sick.

132
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,104
She's had this kidney thing since

133
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,202
she was real young.

134
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:46,850
- On the left side.
- Where is she?

135
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:48,451
She's sitting right there.

136
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,761
Have you been here before?

137
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,110
No. I'm from out of town.

138
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,750
Can I see your insurance card?

139
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,256
No, no.

140
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,581
I don't have any insurance.

141
00:09:57,582 --> 00:10:00,132
After I left the army,
they discontinued my...

142
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,368
Are you a resident of Hennepin County?

143
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:05,413
Like I said, we're from out of town.

144
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:07,593
You have a driver's license?

145
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,327
Look, I don't have a driver's license,

146
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:12,700
an insurance card,
or anything like that,

147
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,139
but I do know the law!

148
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,137
You have to see my little girl.

149
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,911
Let me go get my supervisor.

150
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:19,952
Good.

151
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:26,725
I don't give a rat's ass
about you or your brother.

152
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:28,412
I trusted you,

153
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,332
I took you under my wing,
I treated you like my own son.

154
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,402
I believed you!

155
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,194
Day after day, you lied to me.

156
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:36,900
What kind of a man does that?

157
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:39,536
A desperate one.

158
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,203
Yeah. Well...

159
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,716
you two made a big mistake
coming here today.

160
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,261
You give me no choice.

161
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,937
I'm going to notify the authorities
right now.

162
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:52,924
I'm sorry...

163
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,902
But I can't let you do that.

164
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,288
I don't want to hurt you, Henry.

165
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:04,909
Said by the man with the gun.

166
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,448
If it's the only way
I can convince you, so be it.

167
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:09,724
Well, you're not going to convince me
by doing that.

168
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,287
I'm not the man you think I am.

169
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,624
Well, I have a pretty good idea
who you are, Michael.

170
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:14,645
If that's true,

171
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:17,097
then you already know
I never wanted to be in Fox River.

172
00:11:17,098 --> 00:11:18,941
I never wanted to meet you, Henry.

173
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,779
I certainly didn't want
to ruin your life.

174
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,843
Yeah. Well, you've done
a pretty damn good job.

175
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,628
You're not saying anything to him
I haven't said myself.

176
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,160
I've looked into this. What he's saying
to you is absolutely true.

177
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:30,941
I just want my brother's life back.

178
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,515
I want people to know the truth.

179
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,044
I'd give anything for that.

180
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:35,146
I'd lay down my life.

181
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:38,323
Well, that's easy for you to say,
standing on that side of the gun.

182
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:45,296
What if I'm standing on this side?

183
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,943
There are places
that can better serve your needs.

184
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,481
Look, I know my rights, okay?

185
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,430
This isn't a primary care facility.

186
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,813
We provide necessary care
in life-threatening situations.

187
00:11:58,836 --> 00:11:59,836
I know what this is.

188
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:02,638
4Are you going to wait until she's dead
before you give her some help?

189
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,111
- Is that what you're saying?!
- I won't argue with you, sir.

190
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,514
This is a hospital,
not a homeless shelter.

191
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:08,660
A what?

192
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,464
What did you just say to me?

193
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:17,514
I can't believe you people.

194
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:22,386
Come on.
The line is a little bit too long, okay?

195
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,041
We'll go somewhere else.

196
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:29,107
Where are we going?

197
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,501
We got to find another doctor, sweetie.

198
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:35,952
Oh, my God.

199
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:38,432
Let's go.

200
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:43,536
Move!

201
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,727
Come on, baby.

202
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:07,069
Move out of the way!

203
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:10,909
FBI! Stop!

204
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:13,120
Stop!

205
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,809
All right.

206
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:22,769
Just one second, baby.
You got to get down, okay?

207
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:25,708
- No, sweetie, you gotta get down.
- You gotta let him go, honey.

208
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,490
- Get down.
- Honey, you got to let him go.

209
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,723
Come on, you gotta let go.

210
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,063
Man, she's not letting go.

211
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:34,140
Don't let her pay for your mistakes.

212
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,027
You hear me?

213
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:54,958
I could shoot you right now
and not even think twice.

214
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:56,142
But you won't.

215
00:13:56,741 --> 00:14:00,347
You spent too much time around prisons
to throw your life away like that.

216
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,197
What the hell are you trying to pull?

217
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:03,399
It's simple-- that's the key

218
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,105
to an innocent man's freedom.

219
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,112
Come on, Henry.

220
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:08,532
We both know
there's something going on here.

221
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:09,952
Too many people have died.

222
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:12,480
Look me in the eye,
tell me you don't believe

223
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:14,633
there's a cover-up going on right now.

224
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:17,222
I've got no moral obligations here,
Michael.

225
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:21,912
As far as I know,
Lincoln is as guilty as hell.

226
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,373
Then take a ten-minute drive with me,
and we'll find out.

227
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,460
That's all I ask.

228
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:29,361
Henry, you've looked into this before.
You've thought about it.

229
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:30,683
I have.

230
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,507
And I've come to one conclusion:

231
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:37,792
this has nothing to do with me.

232
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,827
But I am a man of the law and right now,
I've got a convicted felon

233
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:43,298
standing inside my house.

234
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,788
Well, maybe there's something
I can offer you

235
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,238
to make you change your mind.

236
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,692
What do you intend to do with us?

237
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:29,558
<i>You grease monkey.</i>

238
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:31,695
<i>You don't deserve minimum wage.</i>

239
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,970
The hell I don't, work in graveyard.

240
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:36,360
There ain't no man deserve more pennies

241
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,377
on a dollar per hour
than they got IQ points

242
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,017
in their head. I ain't stupid.

243
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:43,906
Seems equal stupid as the rest of you.

244
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,318
Seems to run in the genes.

245
00:16:49,997 --> 00:16:50,997
Teddy.

246
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:52,897
Tensymonyms.

247
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:54,764
Pick a word.

248
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,205
Pick a word.

249
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:00,621
Destroy.

250
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,560
Ten synonyms for "destroy."

251
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:06,616
for "destroy.3

252
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,733
Annul.

253
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:18,743
Mutilate.

254
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Liquidate.

255
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,599
Abrogate.

256
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:24,703
Quell.

257
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,103
Ravage.

258
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:27,606
Expunge.

259
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Demolish.

260
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,208
Extirpate.

261
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:31,565
Extinguish.

262
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:34,392
You see that?!

263
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:37,237
Stupid, my pail, my boy's
gonna be president.

264
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,270
How come you ain't studying?

265
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:07,855
'Cause I'm tired.

266
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:11,126
'Cause I feel like a circus freak.

267
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:17,339
Well...

268
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:20,346
Now...

269
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,427
It's in your own best interest.

270
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,134
Don't you understand that?

271
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,059
Now, you're going to be
president someday.

272
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,836
You mark my words.

273
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,380
Theodore, do you hear me?

274
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,824
What are you going to do with us?

275
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,073
We're gonna put down some roots.

276
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,715
You wanted me dead, Paul.

277
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:26,097
Just following orders.

278
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:28,651
Sent me to the chair
for something I didn't do,

279
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,190
all for your president.

280
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:32,000
You were willing to do that.

281
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:34,947
Just... following... orders.

282
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,431
Steadman said you loved her.

283
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:39,931
He was a deranged man
that lived in a locked box.

284
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,907
You don't love someone
that loves power more than life.

285
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:44,190
Bitter, huh?

286
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:45,784
Am I?

287
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:49,697
No offense, but you're not capable

288
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,698
of understanding the relationship.

289
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,715
Okay, any way you look at it,

290
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,459
there is no light
at the end of this tunnel.

291
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,864
One way or another,
you and I, we die.

292
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:06,979
Your brother, too.

293
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,717
Which is a shame given
all he's done for you.

294
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,084
I have a sister I haven't talked to
in 15 years.

295
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:14,849
Think she's better off for it?

296
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:15,938
We'll make it.

297
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:17,945
What is that, faith?

298
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:19,063
Yeah, that's faith.

299
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,028
All I see is a black hole.

300
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:22,534
And sooner or later,

301
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,862
they are going to suck each one
of us into it.

302
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,848
But when they come for me,

303
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:31,732
I'm going to take as many
of them with me as I can.

304
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,986
She must have really broken your heart,
Paul.

305
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,956
<i>President Reynolds attended
a Chicago fundraiser last night<i/>

306
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,662
<i>as part of her two-day stop
in the Windy City.</i>

307
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,557
<i>Reynolds' popularity continues
to soar in the Midwest</i>

308
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:50,312
<i>with appearances scheduled
in Indianapolis, Detroit</i>

309
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,548
<i>and Flint, Michigan later in the week.</i>

310
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,376
<i>At a Democratic fundraiser...</i>

311
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,122
Mr. Kim,
Sarah Tancredi surfaced
in Chicago.

312
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,434
She was spotted at the Corona
de Oro Club about an hour ago.

313
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:01,591
Corona de Oro Club?

314
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,779
It's a cigar club.

315
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,191
Her father was a member.

316
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:06,568
He kept a private humidor there.

317
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:13,705
Get me a jet to Chicago.

318
00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:59,697
Tell me you're not still thinking
he's going to show.

319
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:02,565
He's let you down so many times.
You know that.

320
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,479
Probably, maybe it's the baby in me

321
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:07,626
that's telling me that
this time it's going to be different.

322
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,510
I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but he's not going to show.

323
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:18,515
Bubble's not burst.

324
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:22,620
I got three words for you.

325
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:23,621
Yeah?

326
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:25,224
We gotta run.

327
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:27,642
Good seeing you, Theresa!

328
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:33,540
Andale!

329
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,211
- I'm so glad you came.
- You're crazy.

330
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,910
How did they know?

331
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,059
You're certain...

332
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,920
about what's in the box?

333
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:20,670
No, but it's all we've got.

334
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:23,664
Thank you, Henry.

335
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,067
You sure about this?

336
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,865
Either way, you still owe me dinner.

337
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:48,629
Is that so?

338
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:50,776
Yeah.

339
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,329
First week in Fox River,
you promised me, if you ever

340
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,490
got out of there,
you'd take me to dinner.

341
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,647
Well, maybe, after we wrap this up,
we can stop off

342
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:00,705
and get you a burrito on the way back
to Pope's house.

343
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,104
I don't know what you're used to,

344
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:03,632
but anything short of a filet mignon

345
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,091
is not going to cut it with me.

346
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:08,962
It's a date.

347
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:19,142
Give me the phone.

348
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:29,303
<i>How did you pull that off?</i>

349
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,388
I'll tell you later.

350
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:31,805
<i>- Is he in yet?</i>
-Yep.

351
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,105
<i>This shouldn't take more
than a couple of minutes.</i>

352
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,010
<i>Any longer than that,
we'll know we've got trouble.</i>

353
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,638
- This way.
- Thank you.

354
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,191
Mr. Pope.

355
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,186
Hey, Warren. How's it going?

356
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:50,977
Did you hear what happened this morning?
Sara Tancredi came in.

357
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:52,521
Yeah. So I heard.

358
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:56,000
Next time, don't let her get away.

359
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:57,859
Thanks.

360
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:57,775
Excuse me, do you mind
if I borrow your computer for a moment?

361
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:58,776
No problem.

362
00:25:58,978 --> 00:25:59,978
Thanks.

363
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:13,714
Pitch in, chitlins!

364
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:15,155
We can't do this.

365
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:16,675
We can't live here.

366
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:18,764
No, of course not like this.

367
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:21,069
We gonna clean. We are cleaning!

368
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,168
We gonna rebuild!

369
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,934
You can't do this to them.

370
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:24,935
Look at them.

371
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:34,064
Y'all mind coming along here
for a minute.

372
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,203
Come on. I think we're past me
waving that gun around,

373
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:39,204
don't you think?

374
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:41,759
Come on.

375
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,324
What are you doing?

376
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,872
Nothing is gonna happen to them.

377
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:47,569
Susan. Susie Q.

378
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,028
Do you think I'd bring you here

379
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:52,029
to so sacred a place to me as this

380
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,178
if I meant you ill?

381
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,299
Look at me!

382
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,671
I am not the animal
you think you see before you.

383
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,275
I am the laws of karma
all come down wrong.

384
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,733
Don't you understand?

385
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:08,905
I don't.

386
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:15,756
What I'm trying to say is that...

387
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:19,774
I am the sin of my father.

388
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:24,452
Why are you telling me this?

389
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:26,246
Because I love you.

390
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,652
Because I want you to understand me.

391
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,870
I am the last in the line of Bagwells.

392
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:37,091
The tail end of a corrupted breed.

393
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:42,381
The earth, thank God,
shall see no more of our generations.

394
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:57,164
I cannot procreate, Susan.

395
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:01,233
And yet, there's something in that

396
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:02,704
that gives me great hope.

397
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,986
No more Bagwells shall roam this planet.

398
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:08,387
Not with that vile blood in their veins.

399
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:11,520
All I want to do is end the bloodline,
extirpate it,

400
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,749
and start another, a fresh.

401
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,153
A new family.

402
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,258
Teddy.

403
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:20,364
Those children are my salvation,

404
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:23,949
my chance to make this world
a better place.

405
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:29,551
I will be good, Susan.

406
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:31,673
I will love them.

407
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:32,922
I will love you.

408
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,279
I will take communion, be baptized

409
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,606
under a truer light.

410
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:40,183
All I ask

411
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,302
is that you love me back.

412
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:43,939
Just a little.

413
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:48,033
Or learn to do so in time.

414
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,045
Can you do that, Susan?

415
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:01,759
I can't.

416
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:05,613
I can't.

417
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:19,140
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:51,596
Teddy, I'm sorry.

419
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:55,001
I can do it. I can love you!

420
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:15,194
Where are we?

421
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:17,421
At the doctor's office, sweetie.

422
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:22,501
Hello, I have an emergency in here.

423
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,156
Hey, you the doctor?

424
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:47,173
- Need to wait your turn.
- No, it is my turn.
This is an emergency right here.

425
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:49,328
I need you to look at my daughter, okay?

426
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,917
She's not feeling too good.

427
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,133
Please.

428
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,202
Sweetie, hold on, so I can...

429
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:03,743
All right, look,
this is all the money I got, okay?

430
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,044
That's $400.

431
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:12,495
Please look at my daughter.

432
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,408
What's the matter with her?

433
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:18,504
She has a kidney disease. PKD.

434
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:20,532
Normally, we have it under control,

435
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,295
but I don't like what I'm seeing
right now.

436
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:23,707
Her stomach hurts, okay?

437
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,531
And she's always hot.

438
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:27,465
- How's her appetite?
- It's gone.

439
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:30,086
She's always tired,
ain't that right, baby?

440
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:31,156
All right.

441
00:31:32,562 --> 00:31:33,562
Hop up here.

442
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,015
Thank you.

443
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,713
He just wants to take
a good look at you, okay?

444
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:43,669
May need to run a few tests.

445
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,611
Just do what you have to do, man.

446
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:49,884
I'm gonna be right here, okay, baby?

447
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:58,920
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- What's going on now?

448
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:00,343
Still in there.

449
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:02,307
This is taking too long.

450
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:04,714
Wait, wait, wait.

451
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,210
Here he comes.

452
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,776
What's happening?

453
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:14,801
We got company.

454
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:17,381
Hello, Henry.

455
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,548
I didn't know you were a cigar man.

456
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:27,725
Who are you?

457
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:29,429
Uh, a friend.

458
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:30,677
A colleague, in fact.

459
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:32,336
We're both in law enforcement.

460
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:33,337
I'm not anymore.

461
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,388
That's right. You're...

462
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:38,058
...retired.

463
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,411
- Know the guy?
- Yeah.

464
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,211
Looks like
the lifestyle's treating you well.

465
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:50,186
Socializing over Cubans and cognac?

466
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:55,344
But that's not what you were doing,
is it?

467
00:32:57,135 --> 00:32:58,135
Henry.

468
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:02,740
You don't mind if ask you
to empty your pockets?

469
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:03,821
As a matter of fact, I do.

470
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:06,350
I'm not going to play
any games with you.

471
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:09,721
We both know why
you came here today.

472
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:14,284
I suggest you get out
of my way, young man.

473
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,359
I can't do that.

474
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,930
Unless you'd like to cause
serious trouble

475
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,370
for yourself and your family,

476
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,109
I advise you to hand over
whatever it is you found.

477
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,044
Now.

478
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:55,429
Get in!

479
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:14,754
Let's go!

480
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:58,673
It's okay. Easy, easy, it's okay.

481
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,616
Ma'am, are you all right?

482
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:05,658
I don't understand.

483
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,042
We got a call.

484
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:09,417
Someone said there's a
hostage situation here.

485
00:35:11,502 --> 00:35:13,086
No one knew we were here.

486
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:36,107
Are you okay?

487
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:37,557
Okay.

488
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:39,883
Hey, so what's going on?

489
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:43,806
I'm afraid your daughter
shows signs of renal failure.

490
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,890
She ever had hemodialysis?

491
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:48,648
No, hemo... No.

492
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,188
No, this has never really gone that far.

493
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:56,897
What, are you planning
on doing it right here?

494
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:58,763
We're not set up for it.

495
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,417
And neither is she.

496
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:04,134
But there is a county
dialysis clinic a few blocks away.

497
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:07,783
But we're gonna have to place
a catheter in her neck

498
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:10,173
so she can be examined.

499
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,800
Hold on, sweetie,
this is gonna be a little cold.

500
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:15,585
It's okay, baby.

501
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,204
Wait, wait.

502
00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:26,507
What is that?

503
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,518
It's a trocar.
It's used for placing the catheter.

504
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:31,001
Lie down, honey.

505
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:39,097
Do we really have to go this far?

506
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:40,525
Look.

507
00:36:41,852 --> 00:36:44,638
I'm doing the best I can here,
but you got to understand something.

508
00:36:44,773 --> 00:36:46,008
Your daughter is sick.

509
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,651
Now, this may look like a
desperate measure because it is.

510
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,832
This is gonna hurt a little bit,
sweetie.

511
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Stop!

512
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:01,857
Come on, baby.

513
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:04,604
Come with me.

514
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:05,955
I can't do this.

515
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:27,369
What's going on?

516
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,958
I made a deal with Pope.

517
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,123
You made a deal with Pope?

518
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:37,401
What kind of deal?

519
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:41,100
If he came with us and
if we got what we needed,

520
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:43,938
I said I'd turn myself in.

521
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:45,256
What?

522
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,494
We don't even know
what this thing is!

523
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:49,263
It could be nothing, Michael.

524
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:50,842
You know about this?

525
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,693
Not until it came out of his mouth.

526
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,846
It's the only thing I could think of.

527
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,826
You two can still finish this.

528
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,781
You'll just have to do it without me.

529
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:01,379
I'm not gonna let you do this, Michael.

530
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:03,270
There's no coming back from this!

531
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:07,738
Hold on.

532
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,998
What's the holdup?

533
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:10,427
Your brother's right.

534
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,588
I wouldn't count on the courts
to show you any leniency in this.

535
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:19,340
That doesn't matter.
I said I'd hold up my end of the deal.

536
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:20,572
You already did.

537
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:24,272
I listened to this.

538
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:26,130
You have something here.

539
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,862
There's gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

540
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:33,052
- Listen, Henry...
- I'd go now if I were you.

541
00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:35,452
And don't consider this forgiveness.

542
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:39,239
In fact, I'm about ten seconds
away from changing my mind.

543
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:42,146
Thank you.

544
00:38:58,826 --> 00:38:59,829
Okay...

545
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:05,347
Here, listen...

546
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:09,000
Let's tuck you in, all right?

547
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:15,551
Come on. Let's go.

548
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:26,164
Let's just...

549
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:28,542
Let's just sit for a bit longer, okay?

550
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:33,491
We're gonna go in a little bit, okay?

551
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:55,242
You know Daddy loves you
with all his heart, right?

552
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,856
I love you so much.

553
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:00,364
I'm so sorry.

554
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:04,238
I'm so sorry, baby.

555
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,328
Got a call for you.

556
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:29,122
I'll call back. I just heard
from some clinic up north.

557
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:31,628
They had contact with Franklin
half an hour ago.

558
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,167
I think you want to take this.

559
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:36,083
Put it through.

560
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,317
Is this the man in charge?

561
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:42,385
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

562
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,042
My name...

563
00:40:44,793 --> 00:40:45,876
is Benjamin

564
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:47,651
Miles...

565
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,310
...Franklin.

566
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,612
And I want to turn myself in.

567
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:55,616
<i>But I got one condition.</i>

568
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:57,070
<i>My wife...</i>

569
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,517
She goes free.

570
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,290
My little daughter,
she needs her mother.

571
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,681
I don't think I need to make
a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

572
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,318
And what if I got something you need?

573
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:53,011
Your wife was released an hour ago.

574
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:54,362
She'll be here soon.

575
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:57,741
You promise me that she will be okay.

576
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,036
Just hold up your end of the deal.

577
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:10,106
I will.

578
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,492
I'll get you Scofield.

579
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:37,819
Here we go.

580
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:46,004
You think it's a conversation?

581
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:49,144
One they don't want us to hear.

582
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:52,543
You ready?

583
00:42:52,942 --> 00:42:53,942
Let's do it.
