1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,640
they are in projection you asked for general

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,130
10000

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,150
you clear go ahead

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,880
there has been a complication

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,180
burrows and scofield had traferred to...

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,130
I read the newspapers,

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,630
you don't have to tell me what's in the headlines

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,270
the exact penitary where they are been held is under disclosed.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,630
But you can guarantee the federal supremax

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,690
No more updates.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,140
Call me when they are dead.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,860
Welcome to Los angles. As it turns out, Men who have escaped not one ,but two penitaries are considered as a bit of fight risks.

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,400
So we need to know where you are

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,960
and what you're doing at all times.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
These are GPS ankle monitors.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,730
Now step up, take one and put it on.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,660
I ain't wearing that.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,660
Let's make this clear

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm your ally,

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,160
but more importantly, I'm your boss.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,500
Which means if this fails--

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,830
it's my ass on the line as much, if not more,

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,600
than yours, so from this point on,

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,230
if I ask you to do something, you do it.

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,760
If I ask you to say something,

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,700
you say it.

27
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,600
And if I ask you to put on a monitor--

28
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,400
you put on a monitor.

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,260
As far as the general public is concerned,

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,000
you're being contained in a supermax facility somewhere

31
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,360
in the United States.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,260
So to avoid any messy explanations

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,560
and stay off the Company's radar--

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,630
you need to keep

35
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,230
your heads down and your ears open.

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,060
We've provided cell phones, clothing, and toiletries--

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,130
all the basic necessities to get you up and running.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,260
you-you patted these guys down

39
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,630
before you let them in, right?

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,060
'Cause I can't be getting shanked or shivved.

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,060
Who's this?

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,260
This is Roland Glenn.

43
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,330
He'll be assisting you.

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,530
We've already got our team.

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,000
No, Scofield, see, this is my team,

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,960
And Roland's working off

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
a sentence just like the rest of you.

48
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,930
In fact, with the amount of security

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,260
that's gonna be around Scylla,

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,400
Roland's expertise will be a necessity.

51
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,460
So, if no more questions,

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,930
let's get to work on finding Scylla.

53
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,060
What about that second step?

54
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,430
What about the break-in?

55
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,900
You let me worry about step two, okay?

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,360
You just worry about finding Scylla.

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,030
I've got an idea where to start.

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,460
That's excellent, Alexander.

59
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,930
See, there's a man who's thinking.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,460
All right, let's let these

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,460
men get to work.

62
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,930
Good luck.

63
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,930
To all of us.

64
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,560
since I was here first I think I'll

65
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
just go ahead and grab that S.S. bedroom,

66
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,730
if that's cool.

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,030
Sara... Yeah?

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,230
...you take the bunk.

69
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,760
You know, when this is, when this is all done--

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,060
you and me, we're gonna settle up.

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,860
All right, obviously,

72
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,300
there's a lot of history in this room.

73
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,660
That's a given.

74
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,760
But it we're gonna pull this off,

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,700
it's gonna take all of us.

76
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,930
We got to work together.

77
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,260
So if anyone has a problem, get it out now.

78
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,230
You want to clear the air with someone...

79
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,100
now's the time.

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,630
All right.

81
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,130
Let's get to work.

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,800
Whistler's assignment was to drop off

83
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,400
this, this, this data card--

84
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,630
th-this 'Scylla' to a Company Executive.

85
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,800
Someone he referred to as "The Cardholder."

86
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,060
And his job was to-to protect it.

87
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,460
To... keep it safe.

88
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,860
Now, I didn't

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,230
see who he was, but I got a look at his driver.

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,330
His driver?

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,960
You want to sketch this guy's face

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,530
and match it up to 10 million people in Los Angeles?

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,130
Well, that's just great.

94
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,700
I saw more than just the guy's face.

95
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,960
All the drivers were hanging around, talking shop,

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,860
but this guy, he was standing by himself.

97
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
Legs apart, hands behind his back,

98
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,160
at rest-- he's former military.

99
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,430
His car

100
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,500
rides a little lower than the rest of 'em.

101
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,200
Probably signifies private security.

102
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,230
Weighed down by bulletproof siding.

103
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,730
His suit, his suit--

104
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,230
you don't buy a suit like that

105
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,630
on a cop's salary or pulling

106
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,130
weekend gigs as a driver.

107
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,700
That means he's full-time.

108
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,760
He's highly paid.

109
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,300
You ask our friend

110
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,460
Mr. Self to run tax records

111
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,930
on the 45- to 55-year-old white males

112
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,500
in Los Angeles drawing a military pension,

113
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,530
and taking six figures from a private security company,

114
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,260
and you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50.

115
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,330
And then I can pick the guy out from there.

116
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,330
Find the driver, you find the Cardholder.

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,860
We haven't ate or drank anything for days.

118
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, I don't want

119
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,000
to die out here. We ain't gonna die, Sancho.

120
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,430
Hey, hey, we ain't gonna die.

121
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,500
Okay. We just gotta find

122
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,500
what's called a compass cactus.

123
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,330
Due to the fact it always leans toward the south.

124
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,230
Inside there's delicious fruit which'll fill our bellies.

125
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,000
Plus, we find out which way is south,

126
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,800
we're gonna find out which way is north.

127
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,760
¿Comprende?

128
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,500
Tell you what.

129
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,160
Why don't we, uh, rest here for a while, huh?

130
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,630
Travel at night when it's cooler.

131
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,900
Si. That sounds good.

132
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,800
What are we gonna do when we get there?

133
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,630
To San Diego.

134
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,230
You mean after Michael pays

135
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,430
for the vile he's transgressed upon me?

136
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm still trying to figure that out.

137
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,630
Nice to work with Homeland.

138
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,960
The FBI would take days to gather this intel.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
Well, the FBI should'a hired me

140
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,900
'cause I could've gotten whatever info you wanted

141
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,100
in 25 minutes tops.

142
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,400
You some kind of hacker?

143
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,930
I design silicon lithography for personal gain.

144
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,300
He's an identity thief.

145
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,630
He's a douche.

146
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,100
Hey, why don't you sit in the corner

147
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,500
and we'll get you when we need you.

148
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,560
This is him.

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,330
That's the driver.

150
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,460
Now what?

151
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Well, he takes us to the Cardholder,

152
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,200
and the Cardholder takes us to Scylla.

153
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,800
You could have left me there, in jail.

154
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,460
Could have or should have?

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,030
Maybe both.

156
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,560
Are you thanking me, Alex?

157
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,130
I don't know. Don't bother.

158
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,130
You're here because we needed you.

159
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,900
Not because we wanted you. That's him.

160
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,330
That's the guy.

161
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,600
What's that, private security?

162
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,530
It's like a fortress.

163
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,600
Slow down. Slow down.

164
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,060
This thing we gotta get,

165
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,800
it's in there?

166
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,700
Motion sensors, alarm systems,

167
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,560
armed guards.

168
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,660
In and out of that place

169
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,730
without anybody knowing.

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,530
You better have one hell of a plan, Michael.

171
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,500
So, basically, there's no freaking way to break in

172
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,830
to the place. Not quickly.

173
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,400
Not without being seen.

174
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,630
What about the neighbors, uh, somewhere we can be staged

175
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,300
from, you know, go under and up?

176
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,330
Closest neighbor is here, across the street.

177
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,860
And even that would take weeks.

178
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,200
The government's story

179
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,860
about us being held in a supermax

180
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,660
will only last so long.

181
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,000
What does that mean? I mean,

182
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,200
then what if somebody finds out we're not.

183
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,700
What if we don't have to be in the house?

184
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,800
If the cd-ar

185
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,000
this Scylla-- is so important

186
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,600
maybe the guy is carrying it on him.

187
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,060
Well, according to public records, the owner

188
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,360
of the estate's name is Stuart Tuxhorn,

189
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,100
and he's a CEO of a company called Spectroleum.

190
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,630
Heavy hitter like that's gonna have security 24-7.

191
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
And we gotta get this thing

192
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
Without anyone knowing it's gone, right?

193
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,200
So even if he's got it on him, how do we get it off him?

194
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,630
You don't steal the card.

195
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,100
You copy it.

196
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,300
Oh, now you're interested in what I gotta say, right?

197
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,900
Copying it will make it harder.

198
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,200
Not only do you have to steal it,

199
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,400
you have to return it, genius.

200
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,300
Only if you don't got me, hombre.

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,530
What's that?

202
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,860
This is the reason I got busted.

203
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,100
Oh, you stole the cell phone?

204
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, no,

205
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,760
I'm lookin' at federal time 'cause I stole

206
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,100
a cell phone-- seriously?

207
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

208
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,800
I invented this

209
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,360
so that I don't have to steal.

210
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,600
It looks like a cell phone but it's really like

211
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,860
a digital black hole.

212
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,430
Wireless hard drive that swallows up any electronic data

213
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,560
within ten feet of it.

214
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,630
Like what?

215
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,900
Like the account info

216
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,460
of anyone at Starbucks with a latte and a laptop.

217
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Like the PIN number of any credit card used at a gas pump.

218
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,560
I can walk out of re and get the identities

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,500
and financial statements of ten people in ten minutes,

220
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,730
On a slow day,

221
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,030
with one hand on my junk.

222
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,300
And the information embedded in Scylla?

223
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,600
If we can get close enough...

224
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,360
Is this number... acceptable to you?

225
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,360
10,000 people?

226
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,060
-Yes. -Good.

227
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,500
Now that you're on board,

228
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,260
we can issue the op-order today.

229
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,160
He's on his way.

230
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,330
All right, hold on.

231
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
Sara, it's me.

232
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,300
Everybody's on.

233
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,200
Now, while I'm monitoring the device,

234
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm not gonna be able to see

235
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,430
exactly what data's being copied.

236
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,900
But, like downloading

237
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,430
quality porn from the Internet, progress bar's gonna tell me

238
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,860
when it's time to rock and roll.

239
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,600
How long do they need to stay in range?

240
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,400
Encrypted data like this is gonna take at least two minutes.

241
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,060
Here he comes.

242
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,830
Sucre, you're on.

243
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,400
Good luck.

244
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,230
sy

245
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,630
Huh?!

246
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,500
Sir, would you mind stepping away from the vehicle?

247
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,060
Talk to me, Roland.

248
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,300
I got nothing, man.

249
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,030
Last time I had this little action, I was

250
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,560
dry humping my way through fifth grade.

251
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,900
Calm down.

252
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,530
Sir...

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,060
Sir...

254
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,560
Step away from the vehicle!

255
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,360
Okay, bro, just relax-- we don't have to get all excited.

256
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,500
You speak English now.

257
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,130
Only a little, but, uh...

258
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,260
How about now?

259
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Nada.

260
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,830
Try to get closer to them.

261
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,460
If he was any closer, he'd be in the car.

262
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,360
I get your little act, Pedro.

263
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,630
Hit the brakes,

264
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,160
let the rich guy pay for damage you don't intend to fix.

265
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,660
Just give the man some money

266
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
So we can leave.

267
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,000
Congratulations.

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
He was there-- I think Tuxhorn was in the car.

269
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,860
So did we get it or not? Nope.

270
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,200
Nothing.

271
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,830
Can I help you?

272
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,400
So how did you find me?

273
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,060
I never lost you.

274
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,660
The, uh, the new nose threw me a bit, but...

275
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,430
What do you want, Don?

276
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,830
I got customers.

277
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,100
Look, back in the days, when you worked with the Company...

278
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,130
Well, for the Company.

279
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,630
I did economic forecasts of their operations.

280
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,400
I mean, I wasn't one of the guys...

281
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,400
But you had access.

282
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,030
Come on-- the last time I helped you,

283
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,500
the only thing I got out of it

284
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,860
was plastic surgery and a $100,000 pay cut.

285
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,930
You know, so either you buy

286
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,100
one of these exceptional family cars,

287
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,800
with above average gas mileage,

288
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,560
or you leave me the hell alone.

289
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,200
I know about Scylla

290
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,860
And I'm going after it.

291
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,160
You know, I knew you were crazy.

292
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,630
I didn't know you were stupid, too.

293
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,300
Well, let's just say I was able to get hands on it.

294
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,230
It's my understanding that Scylla could only be used

295
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,130
if it's plugged into a decoder box

296
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,760
that's hidden in one of the Company facilities.

297
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Am I right?

298
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,260
You know, I wish I could help,

299
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,660
but I can't.

300
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
No, you are helping, Jasper.

301
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,600
Just a matter of whether you do it before or after

302
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,660
I shame you in front of your coworkers here.

303
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,960
Tell me where the Company keeps the box, Jasper.

304
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,030
Could be anywhere; I don't know.

305
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,560
Somebody does.

306
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,560
Right?

307
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
Somebody that you might

308
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,700
have access to.

309
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,100
You know, if you go down this road,

310
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,900
your government job won't protect you.

311
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,660
Then I bet not get caught, right?

312
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,360
If I don't find something to eat soon,

313
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,500
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

314
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,800
We're not gonna make it.

315
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,900
we just got to keep talking, Sancho.

316
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,360
Keep our brains focused on something other than

317
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,430
our empty bellies and our dry mouths, okay?

318
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,700
Come on.

319
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,600
Let's start with, uh, your-your favorite color.

320
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,600
Hell you doing?!

321
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm hungry, Teddy.

322
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,300
Why should the both of us die

323
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,430
out here when one of us

324
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,760
could help the other one survive?

325
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,260
You don't want to do this. Please.

326
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,460
I'll make it quick. I promise!

327
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,500
Sancho.

328
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,330
Sancho!

329
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,630
Why'd you have to go and do something so...

330
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
So Tuxhorn doesn't keep the card on him.

331
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,860
It must be in there.

332
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,600
Look, there's no way we're getting

333
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,160
in that house without being seen.

334
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
I know.

335
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,830
Well, if the card's in there, how we gonna copy it?

336
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,800
We're not.

337
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,730
She's gonna do it for us.

338
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,160
What you reading?

339
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,100
"There is no fighting her.

340
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,830
"No power can fight her.

341
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,960
All that avails is flight."

342
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,760
Thatomer.

343
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,060
That's from The Odyssey.

344
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,060
Is this from my father's folder? Yeah.

345
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,300
And it explains why Scylla sounded so familiar.

346
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,300
If I'm not mistaken, it's from that chapter in the book

347
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,330
where Odysseus is told

348
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,530
he has to confront a monster

349
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,030
known as Scylla.

350
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,200
Wonder why he wrote this down.

351
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,030
I could be wrong, but I believe

352
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,600
Odysseus is told that in order to

353
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,760
continue on his path, to pass Scylla,

354
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,760
it'll require the sacrifice of six of his men.

355
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,700
His only other alternative is to abandon his path.

356
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,400
And he chooses to make the sacrifice.

357
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,930
Well, 's a hell of a choice.

358
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,930
One I'm not sure

359
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,530
I'm comfortable making.

360
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,030
Sara, um, about tomorrow-- the plan,

361
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,130
If you're not up to it...

362
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,200
No, no, I am.

363
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,700
Tell me,

364
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,660
is Claudia Mauricio a good roommate?

365
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,030
A good person?

366
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,160
I hope she feels the same about you.

367
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,330
Oh, Shelby, you wouldn't believe

368
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,000
the traffic on the...

369
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,560
You'll want to be quiet now,

370
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,230
Claudia.

371
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,800
There are levels of clearance

372
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,260
at the Department of Corrections

373
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,730
that are simply not available,

374
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,000
even for friends as connected as mine.

375
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,030
So, listen carefully,

376
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,400
if you even remotely value your friend's life.

377
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,530
You're going to use your security code to access

378
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,830
the records for prisoner transfers

379
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,630
and tell me where they sent

380
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,160
Michael Scofield

381
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,600
and Lincoln Burrows.

382
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,900
Thanks. Sure.

383
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,960
That's a great bag.

384
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,300
Can I ask you where you got it?

385
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,530
It was a gift from my boss,

386
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,460
so I don't really know; sorry.

387
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,100
Sure. Thanks.

388
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,160
There you go.

389
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,460
I, uh... I can never find a good bag.

390
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,060
I'm a teacher, and I have books

391
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,830
and grading materials and...

392
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,730
I should probably go ahead and just invest

393
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,930
in a wagon one of these days.

394
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,030
Yeah, that's why I love this bag.

395
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
It has so many pockets.

396
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,730
Do you mind if I take a look?

397
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,060
Oh, no.

398
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,560
Thanks.

399
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,800
Ah, thank God, thank God.

400
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,300
You all right, mister?

401
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,700
Yeah, my damn truck blew a gasket a few miles back.

402
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,960
I've been, uh, hoofing it ever since.

403
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,200
Where you headed?

404
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,330
San Diego.

405
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,100
Hell, we can give you a ride, if you'd like.

406
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,730
Hey, what's wrong, man?

407
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,930
Eat some bad Mexican?

408
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,930
: Something like that.

409
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,130
Same as yesterday, right on schedule.

410
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,330
I hope to hell she's still got

411
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,630
that thing in her purse.

412
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,300
Tuxhorn residence.

413
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,860
Hello, I'm from the alarm company.

414
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,730
We've been receiving some, uh,

415
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,800
strange signals from your property.

416
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,560
We'd like you to check the windows, please.

417
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,100
Make sure all the contacts are still active.

418
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,300
All the windows?

419
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,630
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,030
Every room in the house.

421
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,230
Okay, hold on.

422
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
Does she still have the bag?

423
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,960
Yeah.

424
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,430
She's got it.

425
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm picking up all kinds of gak from the house, man.

426
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,460
Small stuff, maybe a digital camera, an MP3 player.

427
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,400
Nothing of the size of what we're looking for, though.

428
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,500
Keep her moving.

429
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,630
So far, so good, ma'am.

430
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,860
Uh, please move on to the next room.

431
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,930
How we doing?

432
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,230
Still don't got it.

433
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,630
If the card's in there,

434
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,400
it'd be in some kind of... a safe.

435
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,730
Office.

436
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,860
Ma'am, our system is showing

437
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,160
that the malfunction is coming from a room

438
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
that's designated as, uh, an office or a den.

439
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,330
You mean the library?

440
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,000
Mister doesn't like me going in there.

441
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,430
Well, I think he'd like it even less if you went home

442
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,530
without properly setting the alarm first, don't you think?

443
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,160
All right, I'll check.

444
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,930
We got something.

445
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
The card?

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Oh, yeah.

447
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,600
File's so big it can't be anything else.

448
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,760
Now you just gotta keep her there

449
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,330
for two minute while it finishes the burn.

450
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,030
Stall her, we need two minutes.

451
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,300
Ma'am, I think we found the source

452
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,900
of our problem-- if you could just stay

453
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,530
at that particular window and hold it closed

454
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,900
while we reset the system, that should do it.

455
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,530
Talk to me, Roland.

456
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,330
It's almost there, almost, almost.

457
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,230
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

458
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,400
Come on.

459
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,400
Got it. Got it.

460
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,930
All right, ma'am, thank you so much for your help.

461
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,260
All we need to do now, man, is just...

462
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, she's heading back inside.

463
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,160
What for? I don't know.

464
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,500
Oh, no.

465
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,660
No, we're good.

466
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,130
She's out.

467
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,330
Hey! Hey!

468
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,930
Hey, stop it!

469
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,330
Wait here.

470
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,660
I actually had to slow down

471
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,800
-not to catch you. -I think I pulled a groin.

472
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,830
It's not in the bag.

473
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,530
It's not here. How could it not be in here?

474
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,400
The device, it's not here   give me it.

475
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,030
Son of a bitch.

476
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,460
twenty-six...  twenty-seven...  twenty-eight...

477
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,360
FEMALE VOICE: Go ahead.

478
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,230
Before Burrows and Scofield

479
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,560
were allegedlly transferred

480
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,360
to Arlington, someone posted their bail.

481
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,900
I need to know who.

482
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm showing a Bruce Bennett,

483
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,930
former aid to Governor Frank Tancredi.

484
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,230
You think it fell out?

485
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,530
We looked everywhere.

486
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,260
You think we got the thing copied?

487
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,630
Like I said, I can't read the content

488
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,730
without downloading the device, but...

489
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,860
unless this Tuxhorn's got, like, a 50,000-hour Tivo,

490
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,160
then, yeah, I think we got it.

491
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,930
Doesn't matter if we got it

492
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,630
-if we can't find it. -Where the hell is it?

493
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,360
It's still inside the house.

494
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,800
That's why the maid went back inside.

495
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,860
She must have found it,

496
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,160
assumed it belonged to her boss,

497
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,430
and then she left it behind.

498
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,130
Well, then guess what, fellas, it's game over.

499
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,230
You know how many months

500
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,760
it took me to make that thing, Michael?

501
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,300
What, you just think I can whip up another one

502
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,500
in a couple seconds?  -Losing it is not the problem.

503
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,400
If they find it, that's the problem.

504
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,400
If they find out someone was after that card, we're done.

505
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,830
BELLICK: What do you mean, done? What does that mean?

506
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,130
Does that mean we're gonna go back to prison?

507
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,200
Are they gonna kill us?

508
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,060
-What the hell does that mean?  -Shut up!

509
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,860
means we go in and get it

510
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,560
if we had a few days, we'll figure out

511
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,530
a way to pull this off, but I gather we don't

512
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,030
have that kind of time. Yeah, you gather right.

513
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,630
Look, if you want us to get that device

514
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,760
out of there, you gotta throw us a bone,

515
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,560
give us some extra help.

516
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,860
What you're asking for

517
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,160
requires involving additional people,

518
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,960
which, given the covert nature of this operation,

519
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,060
I cannot do.

520
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,360
Then you're asking for the impossible.

521
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,030
No, what I'm asking for is competence, okay?

522
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,900
I'm not the one who put the entire mission

523
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,530
in the hands of a damn maid.

524
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,100
Look, if the Company finds that copy of Scylla before we do,

525
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,260
that's it, Michael, that's ball game.

526
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,800
They're gonna find out who was behind it,

527
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,860
and they're going to ghost us.

528
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,000
All of us.

529
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,730
Are you okay?

530
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,700
.haeY

531
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm fine.

532
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,130
Look, I didn't choose you to do this

533
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,300
because I had you in custody.

534
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,430
I chose you to do this

535
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,900
because I believed you could pull it off.

536
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,230
Yeah, well, a lot of people have believed in me

537
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,530
in the last few months, Agent Self.

538
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,260
Not all of them are alive today.

539
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,430
Can you get me back the device or not?

540
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,360
All right, this is what we got.

541
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,960
The housekeeper saw the device as she was leaving the house.

542
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,830
Then she disappears back inside for 15 seconds.

543
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
So, we know, wherever it is,

544
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,060
it's somewhere close to the door.

545
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,360
So, 15 seconds,

546
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,230
that's all we have to buy ourselves.

547
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,560
Listen, I'm not sure how close we're gonna get

548
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,460
to this house, let alone inside of it,

549
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,730
but let's say that we do.

550
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,060
The alarm they got installed

551
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,630
in this house is triggered

552
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,500
1.2 seconds after broken contact in any door or window.

553
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,960
BELLICK: Which would immediately send the private security guards

554
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,160
with their 47 guns rushing into the property.

555
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
SARA: And after 30 seconds, the alarm company

556
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,100
will dispatch vehicles to the property.

557
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,630
Three to four, depending on availability.

558
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,900
After confirmation of a break-in,

559
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,260
they'll dispatch additional vehicles

560
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,660
to seal off any and all exits from the property.

561
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,660
SUCRE: I don't know about this, Michael.

562
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,730
It's getting pretty clear

563
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
why they hired a bunch of cons to do this job.

564
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,900
It's not because they wanted it off the books.

565
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,160
It's because we're expendable.

566
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,600
Who's gonna care if a bunch of crooks wind up dead?

567
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,630
It's suicide.

568
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,830
SARA: I'm gonna keep looking

569
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,460
and see what I can find.

570
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,760
That quote from The Odyssey.

571
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,060
What about it?

572
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,300
I can't shake that line.

573
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,460
"All that avails is flight."

574
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,900
What if flight is our only option, Linc?

575
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,260
What if our father--

576
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
after everything he discovered

577
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,100
about the Company-- what...

578
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,530
...what if that's what he finally realized?

579
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,860
You know, uh, the one thing I remember most

580
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,030
about Dad was the back of his head.

581
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,000
Always walking out the front door.

582
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,300
Always running from something.

583
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,700
Mom, us, himself.

584
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,400
But the one thing he never ran away from

585
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,360
was his belief that the Company needed to be taken down.

586
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,600
And we got an opportunity to do that.

587
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,860
Then this is our fight, not theirs.

588
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,930
Man, this... this ain't Fox River.

589
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,600
These guys chose to be here.

590
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,930
Remember that.

591
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,560
They got a choice.

592
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,530
Ready?

593
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,830
Go.

594
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,600
Let's go! Let's go! Go!

595
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,830
Go.

596
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,130
Come on, let's go.

597
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,100
Where's it coming from?

598
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,330
It's across the street.

599
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,030
Come on.

600
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,200
Go.

601
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,660
Just something across the street.

602
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,360
We got a team checking it out now.

603
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,130
You can go back inside, sir.

604
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,660
Must be out of town.

605
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,360
BOY: Daddy, is everything okay?

606
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,100
: Alex...

607
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,760
Thanks, Jim.

608
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,460
: Alex!

609
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,230
Let's go.

610
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,800
Go!

611
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,860
WYATT: Don't turn around,

612
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,060
unless you'd like to experience a great deal of pain

613
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,300
over an even greater length of time.

614
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,400
You-you know, just-just take whatever you want here.

615
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,900
The only thing I want from you,

616
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:16,200
Bruce, is the answer to a simple question:

617
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,800
Where are Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows?

618
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,900
I only know what-what I read in the papers and...

619
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,900
Three days ago,

620
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,860
there were 105 inmates in the supermax wing

621
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,230
of the U.S. penitentiary in Livingston, Texas,

622
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,060
where the brothers were allegedly sent.

623
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,100
There are still 105 inmates there,

624
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,160
and no one has been released during that time.

625
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,100
Someone is playing a shell game, Bruce.

626
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,600
I'm just trying to find out who.

627
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,830
I have no criminal jurisdiction over...

628
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,430
I know you bailed them out.

629
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,930
I know you've been in contact with

630
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,300
Sara Tancredi.

631
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,400
I swear to you, I-I have no idea

632
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,500
where they are.

633
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,000
I guess we'll see about that.

634
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,560
Good luck, Teddy.

635
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,630
Who needs luck when you got friends like you fellas, huh?

636
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,600
Hey, you mind if I take this

637
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,660
old newspaper of yours with me?

638
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,860
No problem.

639
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,530
Sorry to hear about your friend, dude.

640
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,300
It's all right.

641
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,830
He had a full life.

642
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,930
Later, Teddy.

643
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,060
There you go.

644
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,730
Thirty-six,

645
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,900
twenty-four,

646
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,300
thirty-six.

647
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,230
ROLAND: Did you get it?

648
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,100
Let's make sure we got what we wanted.

649
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,560
Linc. Yeah.

650
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,360
Don't let that thing out of your sight.

651
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,060
All right.

652
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,960
We're halfway there.

653
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,060
All we got to do is

654
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
that little B and E, and--

655
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,230
we're out of here.

656
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,230
Reminds me, I need to get ahold of Self,

657
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,430
see when we can get started.

658
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,860
So what are you gonna do

659
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,960
when all this is over?

660
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,460
That's a good question.

661
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,660
Brother, whatever this Scylla thing is,

662
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,500
it is a monster of a code.

663
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,830
Sara, I was gonna come down here

664
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,830
and ask if you wanted to talk some more

665
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,260
about what happened in Panama,

666
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,700
but, um, I think I already know what you're gonna say.

667
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,800
How's that?

668
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,900
Because you're a little like me.

669
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,460
Because you're gonna say you're fine, that you can handle it.

670
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,060
So, um,

671
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,730
I'll just leave it at this.

672
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,630
I'm here.

673
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,530
Whenever you want to talk,

674
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm here.

675
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,230
Thank you.

676
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,600
You know that the only thing that kept me alive

677
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,700
when I was being held was the thought of being with you.

678
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,130
But I also knew that if anything happened to me,

679
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,830
you were gonna blame yourself, and you would spend

680
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,700
the rest of your life punishing yourself for it,

681
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,400
and... I can't

682
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,900
bear the thought of that.

683
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,260
So can we make a deal right now that we're even,

684
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,360
and just wipe the slate clean

685
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,060
and no guilt and no responsibility?

686
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,560
If we're gonna be together,

687
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,860
I don't want it to be out of a sense of obligation.

688
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,760
Or-or even that we should be,

689
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,300
because of what we've been through.

690
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,230
I-I... I just want to start over.

691
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,060
Start over.

692
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,960
Okay.

693
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,260
But, uh, does that mean I have to divorce my wife?

694
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,900
Because you're still married

695
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,400
to a Russian stripper.

696
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,300
Well, "A": I've been a little busy,

697
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,300
and "B": I'm pretty sure she was Czech.

698
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,230
Hey, Michael.

699
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,460
What's wrong?

700
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,300
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

701
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,300
I don't understand.

702
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,160
I thought you said we copied the card.

703
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,230
No, we did.

704
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,830
But according to the encryption code...

705
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,000
Okay, how do I make this clear?

706
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,100
If-If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got's a slice.

707
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,200
So where's the rest of the data?

708
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,500
I don't know. I don't know.

709
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,600
I mean...

710
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,230
I mean, I don't know how we didn't

711
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,230
see this coming.

712
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,300
I mean, it-it makes perfect sense.

713
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,030
It's like the nuclear launch codes.

714
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,200
You don't give all that information to just one person.

715
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,700
How many do you give it to?

716
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,430
Okay, that quote your father held onto--

717
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,930
in The Odyssey, Scylla is a six-headed monster

718
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,730
that requires a sacrifice of six soldiers

719
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,860
in order to pass.

720
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,630
So Scylla isn't one card,

721
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,930
it's six.

722
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,030
What does that mean? How we gonna find

723
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,030
five more of these things?

724
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,200
Michael! Michael!

725
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,430
I'm busy.

726
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,900
I don't care what she looks like.

727
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,800
Three tablespoons of water,

728
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,660
one of honey.

729
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,830
Nothing more.

730
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,500
If she knows something about anything that's going on,

731
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,700
I'm going to find it.

732
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,130
Rise and shine, bitch.

733
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,960
Breakfast.

734
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,260
Michael?

735
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,360
Hey, Michael!

736
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,000
You all right?

737
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

738
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,360
All this security makes you wonder

739
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
what the Company's hiding.

740
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,500
Only way to know

741
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,830
for sure is to find those five other cards,

742
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,230
see for ourselves.

743
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,330
Think we'll have enough time?

744
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,760
Yeah.

745
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,260
We'll, uh...

746
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,960
We'll be fine.
