1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,780
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,050
They refer to it as "Scylla.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,400
" It's like the company's black book.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,250
What's that?

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,830
Wireless hard drive that swallows up
any electronic data within ten feet of it.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,630
And the information embedded in Scylla?

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,450
If we can get close enough...

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,100
it's ours.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,340
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got's a slice.

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,570
So Scylla isn't one card, it's six.

11
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,040
They killed myoy.

12
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,940
I need to find out who did it.

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,030
?????????????

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,250
Hello?

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,380
Cole Pfeiffer, Gregory White here.

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,380
I'll see you at GATE first thing tomorrow.

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,270
And I will personally hand you your bonus check.

18
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,420
Sara Tancredi's somewhere safe, ist she, Bruce?

19
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,280
So tell me, where is Sara?

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,680
Los Angeles?

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,110
Good job.

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,920
It wasn't a meeting between two Scylla cardholders, Agent Self.

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,630
It was a meeting between all six cardholders.

24
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,100
So now we know who has the other five cards.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,480
Hey.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,170
You got anything off the video?

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,910
It's a camera phone 50 feet away.

28
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,680
So, it's pretty grainy.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,070
Still printing.

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,100
You ever been on one of those?

31
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,590
I was still drinking at the time,
so I don't remember much.

33
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,830
Um, told I was a lot of fun.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,210
You?

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,360
No.

36
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,340
Not a lot of yachts where I'm from.

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,580
I always kind of wanted to live on one.

38
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,730
I thought it'd be nice to have
the ocean as my front yard.

39
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,980
The ocean is your front yard.

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,430
What's wrong with the SS Minnow back there?

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
Nothing.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,440
You really want to drop that thing in the water
someday and sail off to parts unknown?

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,210
Yeah, why not?

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,790
As long as it's you and me.

45
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,590
I like the sound of that.

46
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,310
SUCRE: Yo, papi.

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,680
We got something.

48
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,660
One day.

49
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,110
What've we got?

50
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,330
Uh, we got a, we got a license plate.

51
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,300
It's a printout from the camera phone.

52
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,290
BELLICK: The numbers are fuzzy, though.

53
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,030
The whole damn thing's fuzzy.

54
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,130
Forget the numbers.

55
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,020
What's that next to the plate?

56
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,100
Looks like a sticker.

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,780
SUCRE: DMV?

58
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,460
That's a flag.

59
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,530
SARA: It's a diplomatic plate.

60
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,940
The Six Ps, guys.

61
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,260
When I supervised 32 COs back at Fox River

62
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,170
it was the Six Ps made it happen.

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,180
Can you blow it up?

64
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,800
I need to see more detail.

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,730
I'm already on it.

66
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,590
Prior, Planning, Prevents, Piss-Poor, Pformance.

67
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,240
How about you quit shaking your ass
and say what's on your mind?

68
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,720
The second step.

69
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,740
Deciphering the cards.

70
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,630
The break-in.

71
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,450
We need to plan.

72
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,030
Agent Self will provide that information.

73
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,300
You worked with Whistler.

74
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,590
Didn't he say anything about a location?

75
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,720
Wasn't that in his bird book?

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
Which T-Bag has.

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,760
If he made it out of Sona alive.

78
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,540
Finding where the break-in is doesn't mean anything if we don't have the cards.

79
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,910
ROLAND: Here's your flag.

80
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,050
MAHONE: Algeria?

81
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,070
Turkey.

82
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,600
Find out where the Turkish Consul is in town.

83
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,650
You know what?

84
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,030
Get with the program.

85
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,070
You're up.

86
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,960
Uh, his name's Erol Tabak.

87
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Consulate is downtown.

88
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,040
Yeah, but we can't get into the consulate.

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,880
We can follow him from there.

90
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,750
SARA: Michael.

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,360
I'm gonna stay back and work on the video.

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,470
Okay.

93
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,870
One day.

94
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,030
One day.

95
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,910
Cole Pfeiffer.

96
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,110
How are ya?

97
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,740
Cole.

98
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,390
Pfeiffer.

99
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,230
P-f-e-i-f-e...

100
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,540
Damn it!

101
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,110
Cole Pfeiffer.

102
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,300
How are ya?

103
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,660
No.

104
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,980
No.

105
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,530
Call me Cole, please.

106
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,560
P-f-e-i-f...

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,550
e...

108
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,460
Damn!

109
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,650
Breaking down the captivity of negativity.

110
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,700
That's what we're doing here.

111
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,110
That's what we're doing here at GATE.

112
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,390
And I would encourage all of you to...

113
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,670
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

114
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,480
f-e-r.

115
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,700
P-f-e-i-f...

116
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,490
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,110
SUCRE: What do diplomats usually do?

118
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,290
Not a whole lot, but they park anywhere they want.

119
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,280
Put this on the dash.

120
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,690
Can we get any closer?

121
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,490
LINCOLN: That's our car.

122
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,900
Yeah?

123
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,250
We're copying.

124
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,720
He's got the card on him.

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,910
SUCRE: Hell yes.

126
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,430
LINCOLN: That's the wife?

127
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,670
Sign me up.

128
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,750
You lost it.

129
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,410
How?

130
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,930
Dude, I don't know what to tell you other than you lost it.

131
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,100
It's gone, man.

132
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,980
MICHAEL: We lost it.

133
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,710
SUCRE: Wha!

134
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,410
How did we lose him?

135
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,700
We're right next to him.

136
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,480
He's not the cardholder.

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,980
She is.

138
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,670
We gotta get out ohere now before we get made.

139
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,380
Come on, go! Go!

《Prison Break》S04 E04

143
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,770
You know what we've got in common, right?

144
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,860
What?

145
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,300
We both live in the real world as opposed to these other knuckleheads.

146
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,630
So that whole prior planning thing you were talking about, 

147
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,800
if you got something on your mind and no one else is interested, 

148
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,250
you just run it by me, okay?

149
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,590
And we'll just leave it at that.

150
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,010
All right.

151
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,160
Hello?

152
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,250
Sara?

153
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,730
Hey, it's Don Self.

154
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,760
Listen, um, I have sbad news.

155
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,650
Bruce Bennett was found dead in his apartment this morning.

156
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,570
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,350
Lisa, come in.

158
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,690
This will be quick.

159
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,630
I know you're on a schedule.

160
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,450
The value of the kip is at ten right now.

161
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,830
I'll let you know as soon as it reaches 15.

162
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,530
At that point, you'll have to leave immediately.

163
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,010
I have my bags with me.

164
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,000
I could go now.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,260
Don't you have that event tonight?

166
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,870
Yes.

167
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,590
But I...

168
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,210
It's important to keep up appearances.

169
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,180
Not arouse suspicion.

170
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,890
Fine.

171
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,090
I have no doubt in your leadership abilities, Lisa, but...

172
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,990
Good.

173
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,350
Nor do I.

174
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,610
So I won't keep you any longer.

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,380
Please...

176
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,850
be safe.

177
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,980
There she is.

178
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,220
All right, do what you gotta do.

179
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,100
Be next to her for two minutes so the device can copy the card.

180
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,310
I'll get it.

181
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,780
Take a seat.
Take a seat.

182
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,780
See the three suits?

183
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,150
Forming a triangle around her?

184
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,900
Those are private contractors.

185
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,020
The Company would only do that for the inner circle.

186
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,590
We're not getting anywhere near that lady.

187
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,460
Not today.

188
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,390
LINCOLN: Great.

189
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,020
What's wrong?

190
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,540
Hey, Teddy.

191
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,090
Well, if it ain't the Brothers Grim.

192
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,670
Easy, Linc. Remember, we need him.

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,840
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

194
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,120
I was thinking about maybe getting me a career in pictures.

195
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,410
???????????/

196
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,500
Hey! If anyone'sgot a right to be pissed-- it's me.

197
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,670
You put me out to pasture back in Panama.

198
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,870
Left me for dead.

199
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,500
Which makes it the third time, I believe. So, congratulations,

200
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,570
you got yourself a turkey

201
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,640
. Where's the bird book?

202
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,840
Bird book?

203
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
Where's the book?!

204
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,300
Ooh, look who's looking, pretty.

205
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,630
Look who's looking.

206
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,980
I don't thinkthe two of you are supposed to be carousing 

207
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,290
around the Angel City any more than I am.

208
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,580
You don't know what you've gotten yourself into,

209
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,740
Teddy. But if you don't want to find out,

210
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,520
you're gonna tell us where that bird book is.

211
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,360
You're gonna let me go right now

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,930
or all of us are going down together.

213
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,000
Your choice.

214
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,720
Linc, come on.

215
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,420
WYATT: Tancredi. T-A-N...

216
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,820
C-R-E-D-I.

217
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,180
Make it a buckshot across the grid.

218
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,980
35-mile radius.

219
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,380
If she or any of those other names come up, call me.

220
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,530
FEMALE VOICE: Confirmed.

221
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,540
Where are you?

222
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,330
Los Angeles.

223
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,890
Trailing Dr. Sara Tancredi.

224
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,990
I ask for the knights, you're chasing a pawn.

225
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,220
She's irrelevant.

226
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,480
Not to Scofield.

227
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,590
If anyone knows what rock he's hiding under, it's her.

228
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,730
What about Gretchen?

229
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,770
I'm having her softened up,

230
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,390
but I question the merit of keeping her alive.

231
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,060
I don't think you should allow...

232
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,310
She must know something.

233
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,270
She lives until she talks.

234
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,400
Now, I have something else I need you to do for me.

235
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,240
It seems a former employee is looking into Scylla.

236
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,330
T-Bag's in town?

237
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,490
Yeah, but we lost him.

238
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,580
He could be anywhere by now.

239
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,720
It's not where he is. It's what he's doing.

240
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,160
He blew this whole thing for all of us.Where's Sara?

241
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
 The boat.

242
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,180
SARA: Of course

243
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,250
it's my fault that he's dead.

244
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,440
- It's not true.
-  We both know it is.

245
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,100
I shouldn't have called him.

246
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,930
I knew that. I should never have reached out to him.

247
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,980
I shouldn't have involved him in any...

248
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,150
Bennett chose to help you.

249
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,730
The Company killed him, not you.

250
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,270
Listen to me, Sara. This is...

251
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,860
This is not your fault.

252
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,980
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,810
I'm really sorry.

254
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,230
Hi. Can I help you?

255
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,340
With that smile, you already have.

256
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm Cole Pfeiffer.

257
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,150
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh, welcome to Los Angeles.

258
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,740
No, please.

259
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,600
Call me Cole. 

260
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,400
Mr. White is looking forward to meeting with you,

261
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,110
uh, Cole, but he's just running a few minutes late.

262
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,200
Precisely how few minutes are we talking about?

263
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Oh, it shouldn't take long.

264
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,920
You can have a seat right over there.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,720
Oh. Ooh, I almost forgot.

266
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,670
You already have a message.

267
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,360
I do?

268
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,660
Mm-hmm. Mr. Xing called.Twice.

269
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,190
I guess your reputation precedes you.

270
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,470
I guess so.

271
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,230
Don Self.

272
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,570
When did they find the body?

273
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,220
This morning.

274
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,020
They're saying it was a suicide,

275
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,940
but you and I know better.

276
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,170
So I need to ask you something very important, okay?

277
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,120
Did Bruce Bennett know where you are now?

278
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,680
I don't know.

279
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,600
Because if he did,

280
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,580
there's a damn good chance

281
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,900
that the Company does now, too.

282
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,640
Okay? So you need to work double time.

283
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,720
Get some eyes in the back of your head, you understand?

284
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,020
Look, I appreciate the motivational speech,

285
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,150
but how about you figure out where we have to break in 

286
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,010
so we can
decode those cards?

287
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,510
I've, I've got
some guys doing some digging, okay?

288
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,040
Actually, you might have two.

289
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,950
Well, what are you... what are you talking about?

290
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
His name is Theodore Bagwell.

291
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,740
He was with us in Panama,

292
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,410
and now he's here in Los Angeles,

293
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,110
and he has a book that used to belong to Whistler, and Mahone thinks...

294
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,900
Mahone thinks this book has a plan for the break-in.

295
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,510
You've got to be kidding me.

296
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,320
I wish I were.

297
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,240
You've reached Jasper Potts.

298
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,000
Leave a message.

299
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,900
Hey, it's me. Listen, I need that information we talked about, like,

300
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,170
yesterday, you understand?

301
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,400
Call me back. Call... me... back
as soon as possible.

302
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,970
MAHONE: Lisa Tabak. Wife of the Turkish Consul.

303
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,120
Married four years, children-- none.

304
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,990
Listed as the logistician in the executive profile for SENSA,

305
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,430
a privately funded think tank with offices in D.C,
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.

306
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,880
Yeah, and the only thing
I want to know about this chick is her schedule.

307
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,120
What she's doing, where she's going.

308
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,170
We might not have that kind of time.

309
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,510
This morning, when she first got out of the car,

310
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,820
she had a suitcase.

311
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,980
Well, let's check the airlines, match her name against
any departing flights.

312
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,240
Maybe she's already gone.

313
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,340
I don't think so.

314
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,360
If she's going anywhere today,

315
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,530
it's gonna be on the red eye.

316
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,590
According to this press release, Lisa Tabak is being honored

317
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,220
at some charity shindig downtown.

318
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,920
Well, that's great. That's where we'll get her.

319
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,280
What's the benefit for?

320
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,900
She's the top donor of an organization
called Eagles and Angels.

321
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,410
Eagles and Angels?

322
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,420
You've heard of it?

323
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,260
When a police officer dies in the line of duty,

324
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,510
he's an Eagle.

325
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,290
The ones he leaves behind are Angels.

326
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,250
That's a benefit for the Association of Law Enforcement.

327
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,700
If you're gonna get near her,

328
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,480
it's gonna be with about half the cops in L.A.

329
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,230
Jasper, where the hell you been?

330
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,450
Thinking. SELF: Thinking?

331
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,610
Come on, the only thing you should be thinking about

332
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,080
is what I asked you to get for me.

333
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,550
Did you find the location?

334
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,320
Yes, yes, and don't say anything else, okay?

335
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,250
I heard clicks yesterday on my phone.

336
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,510
All right, settle down, all right? I'm coming to you.

337
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,510
It doesn't matter, you know, 'cause you're never gonna be able to get in, 

338
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,560
not where they're keeping it.

339
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,350
I should have never helped you out. I...

340
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,020
Just relax, okay? I'm coming to you right now.

341
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,780
Think they're strong enough?

342
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,400
Together they should be.

343
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,850
That's everything on the list.

344
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,750
You sure we have to steal them?

345
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,200
It's the one thing we need that we can't get at a store,

346
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,750
buddy, so yes, we got to steal them.

347
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,090
We'll get everything else and meet you there.

348
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,870
All right.

349
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,980
Look, um,
you gonna be okay?

350
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,220
Yeah. I just need time.

351
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,480
Right.

352
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,580
I'll be back as soon as I can.

353
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,560
WHITE: I am so sorry

354
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,910
I'm not going to be around next week

355
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,570
to see you in action, Cole,

356
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,590
but you'll be in good hands with Andy here.

357
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,080
I have got to catch a flight to San Francisco,

358
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,560
but I just wanted to say how thrilled we are to have you here,

359
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,010
 and hopefully, some of the rest of the sales force can learn a thing or two.

360
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,010
Uh, we'll settle up that check when I get back, all right?

361
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,720
Uh, remember, don't call it Frisco.

362
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,830
They hate that up there.

363
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,010
True.

364
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,200
Well, why don't I show you to your office, Cole?

365
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,550
- Okeydoke.
-  I'm sorry.

366
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,480
I didn't see anywhere in your paperwork
that you were... handicapped.

367
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,470
Otherwise, I would have made the necessary adjustments
to your work space.

368
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,820
Andy, I like to think of myself as...

369
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,230
handicapable.

370
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,340
Right. Yeah.

371
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,930
Well, here you are.

372
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,380
Right, right.

373
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,680
So this is where I'm gonna be doing my, uh...

374
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,480
my work, right here in this, uh...

375
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,140
...office.

376
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,860
That's right.

377
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,190
So, I'd better be rolling up my sleeves, then.

378
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,920
You know, Cole, I-I got to tell you.

379
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm still a little amazed at somebody

380
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,450
 I've never even seen at a convention

381
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,150
or seminar just falls from the sky

382
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,470
and shatters all of our sales records.

383
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,340
When you believe in GATE like I do,

384
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,200
it ain't that hard to sell.

385
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,960
There you go.

386
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,920
Well.

387
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,210
And here's your corner office as requested.

388
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,360
Welcome to the team.

389
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,380
All righty, then. Thank you.

390
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,240
One...

391
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,380
22...

392
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,840
...B.

393
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,860
Oh.

394
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,100
Hello, Sara.

395
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,820
ROLAND: Hey, Sara, where you going?

396
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,090
BARTENDER: What can I get you?

397
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,220
Club soda, please.

398
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,890
BARTENDER: How many years?

399
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,900
Sorry?

400
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,320
In the program. How many years
have you been sober?

401
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,590
About three years and three months.

402
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,850
Good for you.

403
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,850
Yeah, it doesn't feel good today.

404
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,970
But I'll take the high five for cracking the big question.

405
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,150
Which is?

406
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,140
Is life a tragedy,

407
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,880
or is there...

408
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,150
...hope?

409
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,940
You tell me.

410
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,770
Double bourbon, neat.

411
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,080
Just pour it.

412
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,800
Cheers, honey.

413
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,070
Over here.

414
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,940
Eagles and Angels, with contributions from the Company.

415
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,110
This thing's supposed to start in five minutes.

416
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,430
- Excuse me, sorry. 
- No problem.

417
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,540
Where do you work out of?

418
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,040
That's one of my guys up there.

419
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,800
MICHAEL: I'm sorry, I just...

420
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,160
Oh, sure, sure.
Of course.

421
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,820
SARA: I've known him my whole life.

422
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,820
He was a very close person to my family.

423
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,460
It's always the good ones.

424
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,330
MAN: You ain't gonna drink that?

425
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,380
Honey,

426
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,830
the Good Shepard is here to ease your pain.

427
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,460
Ronald Winston Shepard-- you can call me Shep.

428
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,690
Shep, I really don't feel like talking right now.

429
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,030
You've been talking to her.

430
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,590
Leave her alone, okay?

431
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,550
Pardon me.

432
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,520
BARTENDER: Go on.

433
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,110
When I was 13, I had to go see Annie, the musical,

434
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,470
but my mom had passed away earlier that year 

435
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,890
and my dad had agreed to take me and...

436
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,720
I was all ready in my new dress,

437
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,110
and, uh, and I knew every word of this thing.

438
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,470
And my dad called from work,

439
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,790
and he said he wasn't going to make it.

440
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,230
That wasn't the first time.

441
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,700
And I remember feeling like I was floating...

442
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,430
like I was the only person in the whole world.

443
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,450
And Bruce came.

444
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,970
He showed up to take me and...

445
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,720
And after, he took me home, and he said

446
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,940
that if I ever needed him, he'd be there for me.

447
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,440
And a month ago, I needed him, and I called him.

448
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,560
And he died for it.

449
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,090
Just a sec.

450
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,760
What would he want you to do?

451
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,270
Let me do you a favor.

452
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,330
????????

453
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,740
LIEUTENANT BERNITZ: Uh, before we sit down to eat,

454
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,890
I'd like to welcome everyone

455
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,740
to the 15th Annual Eagles and Angels Benefit.

456
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,610
We all know why we're here tonight,

457
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,380
so I'd like to begin with a moment of silence

458
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,890
to renew our dedication to the law

459
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,180
and to honor those whose lives were cut short

460
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,110
by their fearless pursuit of justice.

461
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,550
They will truly be missed.

462
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,110
BERNITZ: Thank you.

463
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,020
Enjoy your dinner.

464
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,690
I've been made, guys.

465
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,810
Just get the hard copy.

466
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,100
Here we go.

467
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,400
We copped him.

468
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,110
Hi, my condolences.

469
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,860
Yes?

470
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,820
The kip's at 15.

471
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,820
I understand.

472
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,110
I'm very sorry, but I'm going to have to leave.

473
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,120
Yeah. I'm so sorry. Yes.

474
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,430
What's she doing?

475
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,650
She's leaving.

476
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,230
I'm... so sorry.

477
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,080
???????

478
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,330
Yeah?

479
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,670
I've been made. Meet me out back.

480
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,130
Hey.

481
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,180
?????????

482
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,850
I don't know who you think I am, but...

483
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,010
I know who you are. Now put the gun down.

484
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,840
Slowly.

485
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,650
Three. Copy?

486
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,070
Three. Copy?

487
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,810
Move.

488
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,750
Move it.

489
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,590
MICHAEL: Time to get the device.

490
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,590
That's far enough.

491
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,310
Why don't you just call one of the cops?

492
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,730
I work for the Company, Burrows. We don't need cops.

493
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,030
Got any last words?

494
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,580
Yeah?

495
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,580
We got a problem. I just killed one of the guards.

496
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,460
Let's go now!

497
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,430
No. We don't have it yet.

498
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,630
Do what you got to do.

499
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,950
We got to get rid of the body.

500
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,010
Let them find him.

501
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,870
What?

502
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Wait for Mahone.

503
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,450
Gretchen.

504
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,300
How's my girl?

505
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,490
It seems your friend Whistler wasn't the only one looking into Scylla.

506
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,440
You know anything about that?

507
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,000
No.

508
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,730
No.

509
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,760
You never know anything, do you?

510
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,050
You have nothing to do with any of this.

511
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,480
Scofield, Burrows...

512
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,950
- You don't know who...
- No.

513
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,250
You can't keep lying to me.

514
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,510
No!

515
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,780
I don't know!

516
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,140
You look so...

517
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,750
...damn easy.

518
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,620
I can make this a lot harder.

519
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,270
Yes.

520
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,460
WOMAN: A credit card belonging to Bruce Bennett

521
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,670
was just used at a bar in San Pedro.

522
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,230
MAHONE: Excuse me.

523
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,180
Excuse me.

524
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,700
we have a DOA outside,

525
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,860
I believe it's one of your men.

526
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,000
You need to come with me.

527
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,320
Excuse me?

528
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,250
No one's leaving here until you make an ID.

529
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,160
Please.

530
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,010
Mathers.

531
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,910
Stay with Mrs. Tabak.

532
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,110
Uh, what happened? I have a plane to catch. 

533
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,820
I understand. We'll make this fast.

534
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,320
Officer Mathers, he'll wait with you.

535
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,710
Please. Stay with her.

536
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,640
If you could just wait with me, ma'am.

537
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,220
Thank you.

538
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,440
What's going on?

539
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,220
Should only take a few minutes.

540
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,410
???????

541
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,030
This is a nice memorial.

542
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,560
I very much respect the sacrifices you men make.

543
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,040
There's a lot of bad people out there.

544
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,010
Officer Mathers, you, um...

545
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,980
you have something.

546
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,750
Your, your nose is bleeding.

547
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,480
One day...

548
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,910
Excuse me.

549
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,170
I'm looking for this woman.

550
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,400
Sara Tancredi.

551
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,060
You okay?

552
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,460
???????

553
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,740
Hell, yes.

554
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,170
It's nothing. Travel safely.

555
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,160
Mrs. Tabak, we've got to leave.

556
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,160
Ma'am, now.

557
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,970
I'm telling you, I haven't seen her.

558
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,430
You're sure?

559
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,960
Oh, look out, fellas!

560
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,600
It's the pigs! Run!

561
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,340
Shut up, wiseass.

562
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,080
You're sure you got the whole thing?

563
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,650
A hundred percent.

564
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,910
Where's Sara?

565
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,690
It's not my turn to watch her.

566
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,920
What the hell are we gonna do? Someone must've seen us.

567
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,240
SELF: Don't worry, it's handled.

568
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,390
PAD MAN: Politically motivated?

569
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:44,090
???????????

570
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,420
Tip came in to LAPD.

571
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,590
The assailant thought the consul was at the event.

572
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,380
Lisa's bodyguard got in the way.

573
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,870
Did Lisa make her flight?

574
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,260
Yes, General.

575
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,840
What do you got?

576
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,100
I had a guy.

577
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,660
I did. I had a guy.

578
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
He, uh, was an informant.

579
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,500
Actually, he used to work for the Company

580
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,880
for about 11 years until he
turned against them and decided to help me.

581
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,940
He said he had the location we needed.

582
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,120
But I, uh...

583
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,420
found him dead in his apartment today.

584
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,810
I'm sorry.

585
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,120
First Bennett, now your guy, huh?

586
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Yeah.

587
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,880
They're closing in on us.

588
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,590
There's no doubt about it,

589
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,950
and now, I'm, uh...

590
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,390
empty-handed.

591
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,410
And now I have no idea where we need
to break into.

592
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,590
We keep moving forward, Agent Self.

593
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,880
Nothing changes.

594
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,700
- No matter what. 
- Right.

595
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,970
Okay.

596
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,470
Regardless of what happens, I, uh,

597
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,730
I like your style, Scofield.

598
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,890
You need anything else, Mr. Cole?

599
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,210
I'm all right, little lady.

600
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,260
What was your plan, Mr. Whistler?

601
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,780
What was your plan?

602
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,690
FENG HUAN: Shan Xing...

603
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,260
Cole Pfeiffer did not arrive for our meeting.

604
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,570
So you don't have Scylla?

605
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,750
Next time, Shan Xing.

606
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,780
I'll be in Los Angeles if anyone needs me.

607
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,750
Number two down, on to number three.

608
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,800
We manage to get anything off Lisa Tabak's phone?

609
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,940
I don't know.

610
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,670
I didn't pick up anything but the card.

611
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,860
I want to thank you
for what you did back there.

612
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,350
I need you to do something for me.

613
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,040
Yeah, doesn't everybody.

614
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,260
I'm looking for the man who killed my son.

615
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,980
What do you need?

616
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,400
Here's the police report.

617
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:37,280
I need you to get into the FBI database
and find a profile.

618
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,400
This man is a professional assassin.

619
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,440
He's African-American, six foot, four.

620
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,880
About 220 pounds.

621
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,560
That's for your eyes only.

622
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,530
Hi.

623
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,150
Hey, are you all right?

624
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,880
Yeah.

625
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah, I think so.

626
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,010
Well, I was worried. Where are you?

627
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,980
Let me come get you.

628
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,960
No, it's okay. I'm almost home.

629
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,230
Um, listen...

630
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,760
You're what's keeping me going right now.

631
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,530
And you're all I have left, and that scares me.

632
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,660
I just want to be together.

633
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,320
I know the circumstances are a little less than ideal,

634
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,360
but we are together.

635
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,580
You're here, I'm here.

636
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,140
It's not "one day" anymore, it's, um...

637
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,760
it's today.

638
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,200
Well, why don't you come back

639
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,370
and, uh, we'll make some dinner

640
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,550
and maybe find a little time for ourselves.

641
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,930
Okay, I'll be right there.
