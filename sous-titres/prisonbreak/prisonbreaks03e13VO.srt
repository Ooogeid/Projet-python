1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,650
viewer discretion is advised.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,300
Previously on prison break:

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,720
What the hell are you doing?

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,780
You know I have what you need and I'll give
you the rest after I know that sofia, lj--

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,180
they're all safe.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,170
My book...

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,840
my book!

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,950
Get up!

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,780
What is this place?

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,250
Where we're gonna make the
exchange-- on our terms.

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,310
An abandoned warehouse
five miles down the road.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,700
Be there in 20 minutes with my son.

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,170
They must've closed all
the roads out of panama.

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,410
Papa, what do we do?

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,390
Whistler still pretending
he's a fisherman and all this?

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,720
Well, if he's not a
fisherman, what is he?

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,830
I don't care what he says!

18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,440
I don't know anything about
this michael scofield guy!

19
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,390
You sure you don't want
to change your story...

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,660
fernando?

21
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,940
I guess this is where I say good-bye.

22
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,160
hey!My truck!

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,060
No!

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,550
What are we gonna do now?

25
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,620
do you have a cell phone?I lost them.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,560
please.it's my daughter.

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,810
thanks.

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,970
hello.You need to come and pick me up.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,510
Where are you?

30
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,090
let me guess.

31
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,640
If anything happens to him...

32
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,420
that depends, doesn't it?

33
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,070
I'm at the warehouse, like
you said.Where are you?

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,370
Chasing your buddy--
where do you think I am?

35
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,580
Well, why don't you get ba here.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,910
I have lj and sofia.I'm
ready to do the exchange.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,250
-Call you back.
-What?

38
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,220
the plan's shot.She's already there.

39
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,630
All right.So now what?

40
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,950
It took me two weeks to
hook up that warehouse.

41
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,980
We'll figure something out.

42
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,970
I can fix this.That's
what I was trying to do.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,780
You were calling them to pick you up.

44
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,850
So no one else would get hurt!

45
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,630
You really think I would
put anyone's life at risk?

46
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,530
You already have.

47
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,110
irgandi,panama.

48
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,910
......I can't!

49
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,710
You're not going back to sona.

50
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,900
a couple of questions
and you;ll be on your way.

51
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,390
we're looking for 4
escaped convicts from sona.

52
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,550
have you seen any of these men?

53
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,470
sorry,i don't recognize any of them.

54
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,410
you sure?

55
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,300
pull over up there.

56
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,710
we're going to have to inspect your car.

57
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,100
but i thought you said...

58
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,620
...i know what i said.

59
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,420
now pull over.

60
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,420
do you want some water?

61
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,050
Or do you want to tell me
where michael scofield is?

62
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,880
I don't know where he is.

63
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,660
you know, from the first day you started
here, I knew there was something off about you.

64
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,060
I guess I just know a
con when I see one, huh?

65
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,120
Maybe you'll get to be
employee of the month.

66
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,510
I'm waiting.

67
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,860
There's been a change in venue.

68
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,430
Oh, well, well, well.I finally get
to talk to the brains of the outfit.

69
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,480
We're at the plaza de francia.

70
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,910
So you're thinking public place, safety in
numbers, plenty of witnesses to protect you.

71
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:54,020
I'm thinking public place, wanted men,
police, lots of witnesses to identify you.

72
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,060
Plaza de francia.Ten minutes.

73
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,950
Round everyone up.

Prison Break
Season 3 Episode 13</font>

77
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,140
it's anarchy in here!

78
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,880
We gotta hide!

79
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,180
I gotta-- I
gotta help him.

80
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,780
He's the most hated person in here.

81
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,190
If we start rubbin' elbows with
him again, then we're gonna...

82
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,570
he gave me a home!

83
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,500
He gave me third-degree
burns down my back!

84
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,030
He can go to hell!

85
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,960
I owe him this much.

86
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,620
You don't want to help, then don'T.

87
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,750
Get outta here!Shoo fly...

88
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,430
just a few more
steps.It's only a few more.

89
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,650
Then it's home, sweet home.

90
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,140
This is my house!

91
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,150
Easy, now.

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,390
Get out!

93
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,110
Come on...

94
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,720
he's gonna get us killed.

95
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,170
He's gonna get us out of here.

96
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,020
Buenas.

97
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,530
What can I get you?

98
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,420
Club soda.

99
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,260
You been to panama before?

100
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,610
First time.

101
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,090
What did you do back, uh, in the states?

102
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,100
I-I'm in sort of a
transitional period right now.

103
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,750
In between jobs.

104
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,590
Sorry to hear that.

105
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,070
yeah, we've all been there.

106
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm sure something will
come up before long.

107
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm hoping it's right around the corner.

108
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,980
you won't be needing this anymore.

109
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,710
what's this for?

110
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,330
you're gonna give me some real
information on michael scofield.

111
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,710
Or it's gonna be your funeral.

112
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't know where he is.

113
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,830
I don't know how to reach him, I swear.

114
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,480
Well, which one is it gonna be, papi?

115
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,900
Hello, gretchen.

116
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,410
Where's whistler?

117
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,930
Over my right shoulder.

118
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,810
You know, you're the first
to ever break out of sona?

119
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,530
Where are they?

120
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,130
Bring them out.

121
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,780
I've worked with a lot of intelligent
people in this business, michael, but you...

122
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,850
maybe you wouldn't have to worry about the company
trying to kill you if you were on their side.

123
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,130
They certainly pay well.

124
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,670
There they are.

125
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,140
Give me whistler and I will give you lj.

126
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,290
If you move, you're dead.

127
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,050
-It for hand-off.
-Roger that.

128
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,430
-What the hell is he doing?
-I've lost him.

129
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,110
This is not the point of the exchange.

130
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,320
This is just a confirmation
that everyone's still alive.

131
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,660
They're alive.Let's trade.

132
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,060
You'll get a call in five minutes
telling you where to go next.

133
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,370
And when the exchange
is over and lj is safe,

134
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,540
you and I are gonna
spend some quality time.

135
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,850
When the exchange is over,
you better run for your life.

136
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,050
open it.

137
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,440
remove the tarp.

138
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,390
i think i would have noticed it.

139
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,620
someone had climbed on my truck...

140
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,290
do i have to repeat
everything i say to you?

141
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,670
remove the damn tarp.or
we;ll impound the truck.

142
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,650
it;s fertilizer.

143
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,240
just get out of here.

144
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,450
go.

145
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,760
-gracias, papa.
-One more stop.

146
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,140
there's a storm brewing
out there in the yard.

147
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,540
you tell them...come in.I'm not scared.

148
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,590
Well, I am.

149
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,350
You might want to put that down.

150
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,370
oh, teodoro.You're the last one
I'd expect to see at my side.

151
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,810
I take offense, patron.

152
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,950
I've had many foot-washers.

153
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,280
Many men have come in with sheep's
clothing,only to let the wolf come out.

154
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,880
I am not trying to hurt
you.I am trying to save you.

155
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,450
Save me?I'm gonna die here.

156
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,490
Your life is in jeopardy
just being with me.

157
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,930
Not necessarily.

158
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,910
As I was being escorted
back inside today,

159
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,790
one of the guards offered us
a chance to buy our freedom.

160
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,640
If a guard spoke to you,he was
lying.It's impossible to get out.

161
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,640
maybe you've been too busy dying to notice,but
there's a new colonel outside those gates.

162
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,860
Little suzy sona ain't playing so
hard to get no more.She has her price.

163
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,920
And we gonna need some money.

164
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,630
No.No.

165
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,140
Then you will die in here.

166
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,580
-michael.
-The lobby of the museum of antiquities.

167
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,820
Why?

168
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,220
Because that's where whistler is.

169
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,720
You're overthinking things.

170
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,680
I've seen it too many times before.

171
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,210
The first plan goes to hell
and then you start tap-dancing,

172
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,580
and, trust me, it always ends badly.

173
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,630
You have five minutes.

174
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,770
Unbelievable.

175
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,670
You know what to do.

176
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,300
-What's so funny?
-You.

177
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,830
Thinking you can outsmart my uncle.

178
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,680
Walk.

179
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,760
metal detectors.

180
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,200
And here I thought we were
building a circle of trust.

181
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,840
Come to the southwest
corner of the first floor.

182
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,750
Fine.

183
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,140
But that's it.

184
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,150
No more stops on your guided tour.

185
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,800
If I don't walk out of here with
whistler, I'm gonna snap lj's neck.

186
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,710
And yes, I can do it.

187
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,310
Here we go.

188
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,960
Is everyone in position?

189
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,820
Roger that.

190
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,620
Last bottle of rum.

191
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,390
Good-bye, patron.

192
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,210
How much do they want?

193
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,040
50,000.

194
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,960
No.

195
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,340
We're not in tijuana
haggling over a blanket.

196
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,580
We're talking about your life.

197
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,470
Even if I could...

198
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,180
find the money, who could
I trust to bring it in?

199
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,050
There is one person.

200
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,630
How do you know james?

201
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,520
You're working my last
nerve.Move your ass.

202
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,860
Relax.

203
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,630
Everybody stays cool and we
will all walk out of here.

204
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,360
As soon as we get lj, you get whistler.

205
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,340
But lj comes to us first.

206
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,360
Go ahead.

207
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,790
Lj.

208
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,230
Thank god, you're safe.

209
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,320
What about the coordinates?

210
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,180
You said first thing you would do once you had
whistler was to get the rest of the coordinates.

211
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Is she serious?

212
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,690
I'll give her exactly what she
wants when we get out of here.

213
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,430
But darling, it's not
safe.We need to go.

214
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,270
I want to see them.

215
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,220
Sofia, come on.

216
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,030
Let's get outta here.

217
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

218
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,810
Sofia.

219
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,240
You wrote those numbers
on a piece of paper.

220
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,810
I gave her half at sona.I promised
to give her the other half now.

221
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,800
I know what I said, and we'll
discuss it later.Come on.

222
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,600
Welcome to the real world.

223
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm sick of jumping through hoops
to keep your princess in a bubble.

224
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,830
-It is time to go.
-This is between us.

225
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,210
Where are the coordinates, susan?

226
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,430
There are no coordinates.

227
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,350
Sofia.

228
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,470
Come on.

229
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,370
Sofia.

230
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,080
Sofia.

231
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,480
James.

232
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,580
Stop kidding yourself.
It's time to leave.

233
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,040
And what the hell are
you still doing here?

234
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,940
If I were you and I couldn't
bring weapons inside,

235
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,210
I'd have agents at every exit ready
to shoot as soon as we stepped outside.

236
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,660
Well,then it really doesn't
matter what exit you take,does it?

237
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm gonna go out that door.

238
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,600
Maybe you should take that door.

239
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,140
Actually,that door is locked
in the event of an emergency.

240
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,590
What emergency?

241
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
This one.

242
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,250
we're all walking out of here.

243
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,410
together.

244
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,010
that's very dramatic,calling
the cops on yourself.

245
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,560
You must really want to go back to sona.

246
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,360
They're not looking for a
con,gretchen,they're looking for a thief.

247
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,030
Whatever I told you,it
was always to protect you.

248
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,670
You'll understand,if
you just let me explain.

249
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,250
Lie down

250
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,940
all this because I
knew michael scofield?

251
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,110
Tell me where he is.

252
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,020
I don't know!

253
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,820
Lie down now!

254
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,670
even if I knew...

255
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,350
yes?

256
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,520
All right.

257
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,740
It'll be here shortlY.

258
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
now that we have the money,how
do we get it to the guard?

259
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,270
We don'T.

260
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,450
What do you mean,we don't?

261
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,240
We-we-we were supposed to bribe
the guard-- that was the plan!

262
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,670
This is the plan.

263
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,630
This is business.

264
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,520
And you,of all people,should understand.

265
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,720
Help me hold him down.

266
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,340
What the hell you talking about?

267
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,280
Do it.

268
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,710
Do it!

269
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,180
Teodoro...

270
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,340
teodoro... teodoro...

271
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,400
It's just a matter of time,anyway.

272
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,940
but from one thief to another...

273
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,180
out of respect,make it quick.

274
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,880
If you don't fight me,I will.

275
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,560
adios,homey.

276
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,710
over here.

277
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,280
Whistler: What's the problem?

278
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,610
I found this in his pocket.

279
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,690
Would you care to explain this?

280
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,290
I've got no idea what it is.

281
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,260
It's plastic. It's from the gift ship.

282
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,220
Now,if you'll excuse us.

283
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,020
What?

284
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,560
- Stay where you are.
- Why?

285
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,170
Where is your identification?

286
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,950
sofia!

287
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,940
We need an ambulance at

288
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,110
the Museum of Antiquities

289
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,920
sofia!

290
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,710
Dad,dad... you can't do this.

291
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,960
You can't do thi the cops are gonna
start asking questions. We gotta go.

292
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,550
********

293
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,260
What are you gonna do,james?

294
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,440
You go back there,you'll get arrested,and
that won't do any of us any good.

295
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,520
I ought to kill you right now
for what you've done to her!

296
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,340
Enough!

297
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,590
I did what I had to do
to get you out,period!

298
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,130
You remember what's at stake,james.

299
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,340
We're moving.

300
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,200
stop the van.

301
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,330
I can't leave her.

302
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,660
She already left you.

303
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,510
Lj: Dad!

304
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,040
******

305
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,300
Dad,you've got to go!

306
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,820
Hey,I'll stay with her! I promise.

307
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,670
You've got to go. Dad?

308
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,010
Go! Go!

309
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,300
hey,could I get some help?

310
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,290
Do you have everything?

311
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,910
The book is gone.

312
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,060
What do you mean,gone?

313
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,260
Is it true?

314
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,170
Lechero... he's...

315
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,140
- he's really...
- Yeah.

316
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,890
How do you want me to give you this?

317
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,320
The guards,they won't let me in anymore.

318
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,750
I only want what I asked for.

319
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,270
Hold on to the rest for a few days.

320
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,150
If you were to consider
leaving with all that,well...

321
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,460
I just want you to know
I'd be very cross with you.

322
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,720
I've been known to have a
bit of a temper problem...

323
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,250
when betrayed.

324
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,400
No.

325
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,400
A deal's a deal.

326
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,630
You've done so much for me.

327
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,230
You have my word.

328
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,690
Wait.

329
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,730
no,no. It's okay.

330
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,850
I'll wait for you.

331
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,100
ACANDI.COLOMBIA

332
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,290
You ready?

333
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,390
iBiONVENIDO LUIS!

334
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,250
My angel

335
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,660
I'm all right

336
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,680
Where is michael scofield?

337
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,350
Where is michael scofield?

338
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,590
This isn't working

339
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,370
A few minutes
more---

340
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,250
Pull him out of there

341
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,590
Toss him inside

342
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,830
If it's him...

343
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,190
you're gonna find out where they
are,or i'm gonna answer it myself,

344
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,840
so they can hear you scream
when I blow your head off.

345
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,260
hello?

346
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,280
Sucre. Thank god.

347
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,960
When you didn't show up at the boat,I...

348
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,290
I'm really sorry about that,papi.

349
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,620
I got into a little bit
of trouble here at work.

350
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,470
Michael: Are you all right?

351
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,170
Yeah.

352
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,650
Where are you?

353
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,850
You guys get lj?

354
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,910
Yeah. He...he's fine.

355
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,250
What about linc?

356
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,960
Is he okay?

357
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,580
He's fine.

358
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,460
Are you sure you're all right?

359
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,370
I'm fine. It all worked out.

360
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,390
I'm about to catch the
bus,papi. Take care.

361
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,380
Kill me if you want.

362
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,180
Wrong,papi.

363
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,440
You're gonna wish we had.

364
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,230
Lechero is dead!

365
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,330
T-bag: Lechero is dead!

366
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,820
I come before you now to bury the man...

367
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,750
not to praise him,

368
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,180
for there is nothing
praiseworthy about his rule here.

369
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,590
Having one of our own dictate to us?

370
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,720
Well,that's just not the natural order.

371
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,870
All cons are equal!

372
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,260
I have the last remnants...

373
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:28,860
of lechero's cruel empire in my hand.

374
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,470
An empire which I
willingly participated in

375
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,660
and witnessed first-hand.

376
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,210
Money...

377
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,810
made off of your backs and
off the backs of your family!

378
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,660
It's yours.

379
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:56,220
And I'm here to tell
you,I'm giving it back.

380
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,730
Welcome home,papi.

381
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,500
T-bag!
T-bag!.....

382
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,620
We're all equal

383
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,970
We are all equal

384
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,000
she's gonna be okay.

385
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,260
Good.

386
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,600
uncle mike,um...

387
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,230
I wanted*****but...

388
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,670
I found this in the room
where sara and I were held.

389
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,500
I thought you might want to have it.

390
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,770
I'm sorry.

391
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,090
Thanks.

392
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,870
How's sofia doing?

393
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,450
- She's good.
- Good.

394
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,050
The cops will be leaving soon.

395
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,490
- You can go up and see her,then.
- Good.

396
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,780
She wanted me to tell you something.

397
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,940
She said there's something in
her apartment underneath her bed.

398
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,770
Something about whistler.

399
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,940
I'm not interested.

400
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,270
What is it?

401
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,170
Michael,this is over. It's done.

402
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,260
I said,"what is it?"

403
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,930
You're late.

404
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,840
And you owe him for my drinks.

405
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,350
Give us a minute?

406
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,370
It's a nice tip.

407
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,390
She handles the money.

408
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,710
You in?

409
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,060
She'd better be able to
handle a lot more than that.

410
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:42,530
Because if she has done what
you think she has-- sara-- ...

411
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,070
she's the weak link.

412
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,950
And he will find her.

413
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,940
And then scofield will find you...

414
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,370
and me.

415
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,300
And I'm not paying for your mess.

416
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,870
Are you in or are you out?

417
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm in.

418
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,740
- linc?
- Yeah.

419
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,450
I need your gun.

420
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,720
Thanks.

421
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,200
"Jason lief."

422
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,820
You heard of this guy?

423
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,620
SURVEILLANCE REPORT

424
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:05,500
No,but if he's important to
whistler,he's important to me.

425
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,970
Whoa,slow down,michael.

426
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,420
I get to whistler,I get to gretchen.

427
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,620
No,no,no,no.

428
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,600
This is the one chance you,me
and lj have of sticking toge...

429
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,450
they killed sara,linc.

430
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,460
I'm sorry about that.

431
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,320
You know...

432
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,800
listen,man,I...

433
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,070
I did everything I could,you know.

434
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,990
Everything.

435
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,220
I know you did.

436
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,720
But I gotta go.

437
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,690
thanks.
