00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:01,736
<i>Previously on Prison Break</i>

2
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:02,971
The ranch is gone, Michael.

3
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:04,742
We are doing it
without hurting anyone.

4
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,788
I got an idea.

5
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,370
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

6
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,721
Is your electricity out?

7
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,629
Those cons are in one of these towns

8
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:14,563
and couldn't have gone further
than 64 miles in any direction.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,659
I want everything you've got
in that perimeter.

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,234
Well, to be honest...

11
00:00:19,627 --> 00:00:21,406
I was expecting to brief the president.

12
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:22,766
You report to me now.

13
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,462
Frankly, the biggest issue
we have to address,

14
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:27,459
<i>are the charges
facing your daughter.</i>

15
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:28,735
Good to meet you, sir.

16
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:31,452
<i>Sara, do you remember that guy</i>

17
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:33,328
<i>that I met with you
in your apartment?</i>

18
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:35,295
I want you to stay away from him.

19
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:38,144
- What are you talking about?
<i>- I found out some other things too.</i>

20
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:40,708
Where is that?

21
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:42,185
It's Holland.

22
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:43,823
It's beautiful.

23
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:45,589
And gas up the car.

24
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,844
We'll meet you right back here
in an hour.

25
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,577
Put your hands behind your head
and drop to your knees.

26
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,086
Oh, God!

27
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:58,189
Don't say a word, you old whore

28
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:00,678
or I'm gonna cut your throat out.

29
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,066
You try that again,

30
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,442
I'll pry those vocal chords
right out of your throat.

31
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,591
She's coming up.

32
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:15,390
What is she doing?

33
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,727
She's coming up here.

34
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,491
Stay there, stay there.

35
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:37,246
Mom, you home?

36
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:42,300
Stay here. Stay... Stay quiet.

37
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:55,065
Mom?

38
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:45,557
It's okay, it's okay!

39
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:47,049
Back away and put your hands up.

40
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:48,845
- Just go easy.
- Go nothing.

41
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:50,949
She ain't the one
carrying the cards here.

42
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,476
Back away and put your hands up.

43
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:54,815
I put my hand up,

44
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,491
I'll take her jugular with it.

45
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:59,116
I don't want anyone
to do anything stupid, okay?

46
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:03,754
Don't move.

47
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,425
Let's be civil.

48
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,766
Stop. Relax.

49
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:11,190
Free to go.

50
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:14,089
Guy at the garden center
said Burrows was strong as a gorilla.

51
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:16,099
It was 1:00pm when they tangled it up.

52
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:18,830
The guy IDed both of them.
Scofield, Burrows.

53
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,177
No doubt about it in his mind.

54
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:21,740
Of course, given that was 1:00pm,

55
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:23,724
those two
could be 300 miles from here by now.

56
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,979
You have a half a dozen picks,
shovels and power tools

57
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:27,020
missing from that store.

58
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,416
They're here and they're digging.

59
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:29,487
Five million dollars

60
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,532
buried somewhere
beneath the streets of Tooele.

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,688
You really believe that?

62
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:35,354
They believe that,
and that's the important thing.

63
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,071
They could be anywhere now.

64
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:39,500
We don't have the units
to go door-to-door.

65
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,295
We won't need them.

66
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:44,292
He's gonna tell us where to look.

67
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:55,707
Transript: www.1000fr.com
BLinda Synch: www.sub-way.fr

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,375
So funny, I was just about to text you.

69
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:29,341
- Today's your lucky day.
- Is it?

70
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:33,407
Yeah, my Aunt Maxine finally gave me

71
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:35,564
her famous chocolate chip cookie recipe

72
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:37,076
and if you're free tonight,

73
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,044
I'd love for you to be my guinea pig.

74
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,394
I can't. Not tonight.

75
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,392
Come on. You sound just like Daniel.
"Not tonight."

76
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,959
- Not tonight.
- You know what?

77
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,894
If you don't mind,
I've actually gotta go.

78
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:53,044
Are you okay? I mean, your cart's empty.

79
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:55,979
I'm good. Thanks. Just gotta go.

80
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,011
Sara.

81
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:14,459
This is going wrong
in every possible way.

82
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:16,411
This is stupid, man.
We cannot do this.

83
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:17,990
Hat's over the wall now.

84
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,354
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

85
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,472
I mean we committed.

86
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:25,512
It's time to go get the hat.

87
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,996
We don't have a choice.

88
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:31,210
Yeah, we do. We can walk
right up out of here right now, man.

89
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:32,291
And then what?

90
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,478
We are already in the house.

91
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:38,846
Those women are bound.
We have already committed this crime.

92
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,424
We leave,
it ain't gonna change any of that.

93
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,150
Why couldn't it be just be a silo

94
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,769
in the middle of a field
with no one around?

95
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:53,271
We'll figure it out.
We can get the money another way.

96
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,336
Yeah, maybe I can rob another bank.

97
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,887
You know what Charles once said to me?

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,438
He said there's no such thing
as an ex-con.

99
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,566
Because I used to think

100
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,950
there was a way
we could wipe the slate clean,

101
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:12,346
make up for everything we've done.

102
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,651
The hat's over the wall, Linc.

103
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:21,851
For everyone.

104
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,250
"Sorry" isn't gonna mean anything
to you right now,

105
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:35,867
but I want to say it anyway.

106
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:40,161
This wasn't supposed to happen.

107
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,349
One or two hours tops
and we'll be out of here,

108
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,355
and you have my word,

109
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,508
no one will harm you.

110
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:54,879
Keep your eyes open, okay?

111
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:57,649
Nothing happens to them.

112
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:00,384
Nothing.

113
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:14,864
<i>The doctor is suspicious.</i>

114
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,918
<i>She should be.</i>

115
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,399
She was on the line
with the governor when you walked up.

116
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:20,582
<i>You were listening.</i>

117
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,190
<i>Both lines are tapped.</i>

118
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:23,415
<i>We're not rookies.</i>

119
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,351
Did her father tell her what he found?

120
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,126
Not over the phone.

121
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:30,682
<i>But he knows who you are,</i>

122
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:32,548
<i>and so does she.</i>

123
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:36,938
Seeing how she was supposed
to lead you to Scofield and to Burrows,

124
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:38,539
<i>it looks like we're back to square one.</i>

125
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:39,561
Not necessarily.

126
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,576
<i>There are other people they care about.</i>

127
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:42,832
The kid.

128
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,041
<i>L.J.</i>

129
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,294
In terms of the governor...

130
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:49,532
Burrows' kid, Paul.

131
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,663
Focus.

132
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,564
Governor Tancredi's office. Please hold.

133
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,370
Hey, is, is my father in please?

134
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:07,548
Just a second.

135
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:10,681
- Hey, Bruce.
- Hi, Sara.

136
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:13,367
I'm trying to get a hold of Dad.
I need to reach him on his cell.

137
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,200
He actually just landed.
Wiil be home soon.

138
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,920
I don't know if he's going to be
in much of a mood to talk, though.

139
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,961
Why?

140
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,917
Your father got a call
from the White House.

141
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:22,580
They withdrew his nomination.

142
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,264
What?

143
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,939
I talked to him two hours ago.
He didn't say anything about that.

144
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:28,058
It just happened.

145
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:30,989
According to them, his confirmation
was going to be a problem.

146
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:34,003
We had the votes, right?

147
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,295
Super majority.

148
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,565
Okay. So...

149
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:40,179
President Reynolds
pulled the plug on a sure thing

150
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,122
in order to start over from scratch?

151
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:44,992
How often does something like that
happen in politics?

152
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,864
Never.

153
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,980
Since when did we become kidnappers?

154
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:56,356
It ain't right.

155
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,056
Well,

156
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,323
we can buy a conscience tomorrow.

157
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,590
Yeah, well, yeah.

158
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,808
Closing your eyes
ain't gonna make it go away.

159
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,283
I'll take five minutes

160
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,525
of a situation I can control

161
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,625
over 50 years of one I can't any day.

162
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,535
Hey, Mr. Hundred Dollar Bill.

163
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:18,036
What's it like being with
the African persuasion anyhow?

164
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,703
You shut the hell up.

165
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,023
Hit me a nerve.

166
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,230
Why don't you get down in that hole
and dig, man?

167
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,302
Yeah. How about you backin' up,
dark fella?

168
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,868
You're a long way away from home,
trailer park.

169
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:35,712
I can put you in that hole,
and nobody would ever hear you scream.

170
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:36,921
Knock it off.

171
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:40,140
<i>We have security expert Marc Bruni
with us who will explain</i>

172
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:43,973
<i>how other prisons are ensuring
that they are not victimized</i>

173
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:46,134
<i>by the next Fox River Eight.</i>

174
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,497
Should be the Fox River Seven

175
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:51,387
now that Abruzzi's taken his dirt nap.

176
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,662
God rest the man's soul, of course.

177
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:57,320
Speaking of numbers, we're short one.

178
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,905
Kid's taken a long time
to fill that gas tank up.

179
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,590
Leaned on him
in every way I can think of.

180
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,538
He's... he's not talking.

181
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:32,846
Are you Catholic?

182
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,561
Are you Catholic?

183
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,323
Not much good in it.

184
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,860
Lot of guilt.

185
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:50,753
But the one good thing is confession.

186
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:55,460
Whatever you got eating at you,
you just...

187
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,560
give it up.

188
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,687
Feels good, I have to say.

189
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:03,460
Guess it's letting it out.

190
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,858
Letting another human being hear it.

191
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,293
I ain't got nothin' to say to you, man.

192
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:17,178
What if I told you something?

193
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:20,897
A secret nobody else knows.

194
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:25,766
Oscar Shales...

195
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,858
Guy I was chasing a few years back.

196
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:37,942
Smart as hell.

197
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:39,766
I...

198
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:42,137
kept just missing him.

199
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,808
It became kind of a game, like, chess.

200
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,756
Would've almost been fun
if it weren't for the fact

201
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:51,916
that he was killing people
all along the way.

202
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:57,978
Bodies kept stacking up,

203
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:01,126
and I started to feel
that it was because of me.

204
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,126
Because I couldn't do my job.

205
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:06,762
Because I wasn't smart enough.

206
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,100
Never did catch him,

207
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:16,247
but I did lose him.

208
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,779
I saw things when I would drive
at night:

209
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:24,026
bodies...

210
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:27,627
nightmares to the point
that I couldn't sleep.

211
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:30,825
It...

212
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:33,779
was a complete break from reality.

213
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,543
That's what these little guys are for.

214
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:40,611
To keep me in the game.

215
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:48,126
So now you know.

216
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,921
Now it's off my chest.

217
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,405
Ought to try it sometime.

218
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:07,617
Like I said before...

219
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,560
I ain't gonna tell you nothin'.

220
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,612
You know where those guys are.

221
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:18,727
If you're looking for a rat,
you got the wrong guy, man.

222
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,738
Nah, I'm just trying to spare you
some guilt.

223
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:31,121
Bagwell was free less than 24 hours
before he killed his first victim.

224
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:37,145
If you don't tell me where he is now,

225
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,772
he's gonna kill again,

226
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:41,493
and that blood is gonna be
on your conscience

227
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:42,844
and nobody else's.

228
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,553
Confession might not be
such a bad thing, huh?

229
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,270
- He just arrived, L.J.
- That's impossible.

230
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,510
I- I don't have a meeting
scheduled with my lawyer.

231
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,655
He's a court-appointed
public defender in Illinois.

232
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,588
I doubt he would come
to Arizona without calling me.

233
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:15,802
Let's go.

234
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:47,675
Yeah.

235
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:50,365
<i>We're all set in Arizona
with the Burrows kid.</i>

236
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,840
Good.

237
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:53,542
<i>The kid's as good as gone.</i>

238
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:02,937
What'd you say the name
of that lawyer was?

239
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,153
Didn't give it to me.

240
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,453
Gave it to the warden.

241
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,351
Then I want to talk to the warden.

242
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,453
Hey, you hear me?

243
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:09,761
After.

244
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:37,987
Hello, L.J.

245
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,107
What do you want?

246
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:42,036
They didn't tell you why I came here?

247
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:46,418
I'm an ADA here in Mohave County.

248
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,482
I'm here to serve you with these.

249
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,352
What are those?

250
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,857
Your release papers.

251
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,032
- Hey.
- Ms. Tancredi.

252
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,962
- Is my dad in?
- In his study.

253
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:16,258
Great. Thank you.

254
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:21,209
Dad?

255
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:36,521
Help!

256
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:00,474
I need my pill.

257
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,450
Please, I need my pill.

258
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:10,622
What?

259
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,294
I need my pills.

260
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:15,301
- Forget it.
- No, you don't understand. I need them.

261
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:17,693
They're for my baby.

262
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:20,504
They're Metformin
to prevent a miscarriage.

263
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:21,708
Please.

264
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:25,672
They're in the drawer in the kitchen.

265
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,067
That one right there.

266
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,032
- How many?
- Two.

267
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:37,399
And water. Please.

268
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,849
You know I got to put the gag back on.

269
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,198
Wait, before you do,
I just have one more question.

270
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,615
You seem like a really good guy.

271
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:04,864
Why are you doing this?

272
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,548
I'm not a good guy.

273
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:17,946
<i>...and these changes, do you
really think they'll help keep predators</i>

274
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:20,973
<i>like Theodore Bagwell
safely behind bars?</i>

275
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,161
Picture makes me look like a sociopath.

276
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:31,454
I'm not joking with you, trailer park.

277
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,901
Now, get in here and dig!

278
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:36,038
I am incapable, thanks to all y'all.

279
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:39,635
Just remember that my X marked the spot!

280
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:40,791
You remember that.

281
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,621
We got a bigger issue. The kid.

282
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:44,555
How long's it been since he left?

283
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:46,154
An hour and a half, could be.

284
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,833
Hour and a half to fill a tank of gas?

285
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:50,434
That ain't right.

286
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:53,380
<i>There's been a breaking development
in the double homicide prosecution</i>

287
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,882
<i>of Lincoln Burrows Jr.</i>

288
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,149
<i>Due to the sudden disappearance
of crucial blood and...</i>

289
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:00,448
Hey, Linc, I didn't know you had a boy.

290
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,173
<i>...itself, the Cook County
District Attorney's Office</i>

291
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:08,294
<i>had no choice but to drop
all charges against the 16-year-old.</i>

292
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,201
<i>Burrows is scheduled to be released
from the Klipton Detention Center</i>

293
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,107
<i>in Kingman, Arizona,
where he's currently being held,</i>

294
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:16,703
<i>tomorrow morning.</i>

295
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,172
Keys to the car, where are they?

296
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:25,522
Just hold on, okay?

297
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,560
You can't do this. Linc.

298
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,337
We are five minutes away in there.

299
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:33,484
We've been five minutes for four hours.

300
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,484
Just give me some time. Be patient.

301
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:36,822
You think I care about the money?

302
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:38,170
I'm doing what's necessary!

303
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,679
You're afraid to fail, you're afraid

304
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,523
this big plan of yours
ain't gonna work out.

305
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,510
You want to get caught proving you can
pull this thing off, be my guest.

306
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:46,380
L.J's out there, I'm gonna get him.

307
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:49,647
We have come 1,500 miles
across the country.

308
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:52,189
We have made it this far.

309
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,412
Then I guess this is where we part ways.

310
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,874
<i>Any word of how the interrogation's
going?</i>

311
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,437
<i>Nah, the kid's still stonewalling,</i>

312
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,956
<i>but we've got confirmation</i>

313
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:46,390
on Patoshik. His prints were
all over that old lady's house.

314
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:48,905
So he leaves the cash and the jewelry.

315
00:20:48,968 --> 00:20:52,075
The only thing he steals
is a ten-dollar oil painting.

316
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,093
What the hell does he want with that?

317
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:18,855
Is there something I can help you with?

318
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,933
What? No.

319
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:24,706
You know, it'd be a little easier
if you used the cart for all that stuff.

320
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:29,369
I'm just... I wanted to...
see if it'd all fit in the bag.

321
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:34,584
What happened to your knee there?

322
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,173
Motorcycle accident.

323
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:37,956
So, uh...

324
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:40,368
you don't move around
too well, then, do you?

325
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:41,783
Not really.

326
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:42,999
That's good.

327
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,111
You can still come with me.

328
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:07,943
No, I can...

329
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,583
I can do this.

330
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:15,640
And if you can't?

331
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:17,082
Then we still meet up

332
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,491
- exactly where we planned.
- Bolshee Booze.

333
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,483
- Bolshoi.
- Bolshoi.

334
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:24,190
L.J's gonna be with me.

335
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:27,084
You remember how to get there?

336
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,282
Have I forgotten?

337
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:30,450
Thursday night, 6:00.

338
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:33,120
It's our last shot.

339
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:36,689
If we're...

340
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:40,684
If we do this right,

341
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:42,851
we're gone, forever.

342
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:46,363
Lot of ground to cover in three days.

343
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,092
Lot of ground.

344
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:49,559
Yeah.

345
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,415
All right.

346
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:54,463
Take care.

347
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,879
They'll be gunning for you.

348
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:01,389
They'll get you any way they can, so...

349
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,864
Yep.

350
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:06,175
Tell L.J...

351
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,978
Tell him I said there'll be a surfboard

352
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:10,435
with his name on it.

353
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,413
Nice.

354
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:13,915
Bolshoi Booze.

355
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,400
Three days.

356
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:16,898
Keep your head down.

357
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:50,038
Ms. Tancredi...

358
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:53,095
Hi.

359
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,543
I just wanted to let you know
that the ME,

360
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,149
she's finished her preliminary
examination of the body.

361
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:01,962
She found no signs of foul play.

362
00:24:04,756 --> 00:24:05,808
I know it's a shock,

363
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,750
but we've also spoken
to the detail guard stationed outside

364
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,061
and he didn't see anyone
other than your father

365
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:14,065
enter or exit the mansion
since he came back from Washington.

366
00:24:14,617 --> 00:24:16,585
My father is not a suicidal man.

367
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:23,916
Look, is there any extended family
I should call?

368
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:26,852
I'm an only child.
My mother passed away.

369
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:30,606
Could I have a moment, please?

370
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:31,764
Yeah.

371
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:06,584
That's a hell of a good deal, son.

372
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:10,211
I mean, we're talking no additional time
on your sentence for the escape.

373
00:25:10,248 --> 00:25:12,236
You want it in writing,
I'll put it in writing.

374
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,482
We will put you up at Club Fed

375
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,643
and you'll spend your days
playing racquetball

376
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,587
with stockbrokers and lawyers.

377
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,871
4 years from now,
you'll be out on the street,

378
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:25,758
22 years old with a clean slate

379
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:29,038
and your whole life ahead of you,

380
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,613
and no blood on your hands.

381
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:35,264
Okay?

382
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,826
There's a woman in the house.

383
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:47,316
If you guys show up...

384
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,244
it's just gonna turn her into a hostage.

385
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:55,775
T- Bag...

386
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,283
he ain't coming out alive.

387
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:00,350
And he's gonna take her with him.

388
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,278
Let me worry about that.

389
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:04,456
No, hell, no.

390
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:09,559
The only way that
that woman comes out free

391
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:11,801
is if someone shows up on that porch

392
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,738
that they trust.

393
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:15,841
Being you?

394
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:20,224
Being me.

395
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:35,340
You like...

396
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:37,822
You like jerk... you like jerky?

397
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:41,770
You like jerky.

398
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:49,936
What were you in for?

399
00:27:51,952 --> 00:27:53,553
I don't want to talk, lady.

400
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:55,678
I'm a prisoner in my own house.

401
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,237
Least you could offer me
is a little conversation.

402
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,197
All right.

403
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,019
Just let me know when I hit it.

404
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:07,492
Murder?

405
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,588
Rape? Kidnapping?

406
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,183
Sexual abuse?

407
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,226
Child sexual abuse?

408
00:28:13,304 --> 00:28:14,696
Aggravated robbery.

409
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,074
How long were you doing?

410
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:20,067
Five years.

411
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,367
How much longer
did you have left to serve?

412
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:23,875
18 months.

413
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:26,684
Why on earth would you break
out of prison with...?

414
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,483
What's her name?

415
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:37,178
It doesn't matter.

416
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:39,939
So what, she was running away
with another man?

417
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:46,377
- Maybe you should have let her go...
- She's having my baby.

418
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,867
How far along is she?

419
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,936
I don't wanna talk about it.

420
00:28:52,284 --> 00:28:55,650
I'm two months. I just had
my first trimester sonogram on Tuesday.

421
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:57,212
<i>10-5 Dispatch to all units.</i>

422
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,803
Has she shown you pictures of...?

423
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,787
<i>Transporting David Apolskis
in F.B.I custody. Stand by.</i>

424
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:13,657
Yo, this is going to take all day.

425
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:15,057
We need more manpower.

426
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:17,056
You know, standing around
jabbering ain't gonna

427
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,639
get the dirt out of that ground.

428
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:20,317
All right, that's it!

429
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,635
Son of a bitch!

430
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,361
Now what?

431
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,738
- We gotta roll.
- Why?

432
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,072
They got Tweener. It was on the radio.

433
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,919
Nice knowing y'all.

434
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,614
Did they say anything
about where we are?

435
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:40,249
I'm not hanging around to find out.

436
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,206
Well, maybe you should.

437
00:29:57,944 --> 00:29:59,487
Maybe you should.

438
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:08,887
Maybe we all should.

439
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:30,775
Let's go over this again.
None of them are armed?

440
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,134
With guns? No.

441
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,995
Bagwell had a screwdriver or something.

442
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:38,922
- Do we really need this, man?
- Yeah.

443
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,960
In case you decide to do
something stupid like tip them off.

444
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,805
You know what's out there?

445
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:50,108
Holland.

446
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:57,457
I'm going to live in a windmill.

447
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:00,318
All we need is a raft.

448
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:03,927
I'm going to build it.

449
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:07,125
I'll start with this...

450
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,167
no, this stick.

451
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:21,580
Charles Westmoreland, God bless you
and your wrinkled old sack.

452
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:23,887
It's all here.

453
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:26,298
I owe you a profound thanks, pretty.

454
00:31:28,146 --> 00:31:29,458
A couple days from now,

455
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,517
I'm gonna be walking down
the streets of Bangkok

456
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:32,857
with a million US in my pocket.

457
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:35,543
That's about 40 million baht
in the local currency.

458
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:37,872
What the hell is up
with you and Thailand?

459
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:42,291
Black market surgery,
anonymous transplant donors,

460
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:45,158
"he's" dressed like "she"...
what's there not to like?

461
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,590
Are you really going
to try to replace that hand?

462
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,258
Body ain't takin' to this one.

463
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,338
- Unbelievable.
- All right, let's move.

464
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,323
You know,
that hand ain't gonna be white.

465
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:04,230
- What?
- The new one.

466
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:07,069
Even if you get down there,
it ain't gonna be white.

467
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,900
Hey, Johnny KKK over here
is gonna have an Asian hand.

468
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,637
No mistakes. Let's get them clean.

469
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:43,168
I need to know if I can trust him.

470
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:45,473
They're escaping.

471
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,219
Not man, let me out here, like...

472
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:48,885
We had a deal, remember?

473
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,178
Now walk.

474
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,059
- Scott...
- I don't got much time, all right.

475
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,023
<i>I had to tell you something.</i>

476
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,159
What you did for me
that day at the motel...

477
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,946
...ain't nobody in my life
has been to bat for me like that.

478
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:51,555
And I lied to you.

479
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,277
My name isn't Scott.

480
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:57,407
My name is Dave.

481
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:59,480
- Dave Apolskis.
- Get down!

482
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:02,817
Get Down! Now!

483
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,728
And I just...

484
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:10,458
I wanted you to know.
I'll be writing you.

485
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,483
And I sure as hell
hope that you write back.

486
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,363
<i>Can I help you?</i>

487
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:37,615
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

488
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:39,212
Contractor.

489
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,590
We got some electrical issues.

490
00:34:42,189 --> 00:34:43,639
No, you can't help me.

491
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:45,751
Excuse me. Is there a problem?

492
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:49,023
Ms. Owens is not home.

493
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:52,011
Yeah, well, I'm supposed
to drive her to the club...

494
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:53,400
She already went to the club.

495
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,615
Yeah, she came out,
said she was going to the club.

496
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,122
She got into her car and left.

497
00:35:01,242 --> 00:35:02,921
I don't know what else to tell you.

498
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:06,915
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

499
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:28,191
He's gone.

500
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:29,804
We got to get out of here.

501
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:32,752
'Cause once he gets to the club,
he's gonna find out she's not there.

502
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:34,025
Then he's going to be back.

503
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,168
Know what?

504
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:42,389
You were right.

505
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,932
It does feel good
to get stuff off your chest.

506
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,597
I'm sorry I had to play you
like that, bro.

507
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:58,919
Yo, what's up?

508
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,731
Come on. It's gonna be a long drive.

509
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:05,388
Stretch your legs.

510
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,341
All right.

511
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:45,869
<i>Kellerman.</i>

512
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,625
<i>I thought you were going to deal
with the L.J. Burrows situation.</i>

513
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,098
Oh, I did.

514
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:52,799
Then why is he being released
from custody tomorrow?

515
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,455
<i>In and of itself,</i>

516
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:55,998
the kid is useless to us.

517
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:59,011
His only value
is in who comes looking for him.

518
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:01,732
More importantly, though,

519
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:03,298
<i>Governor Tancredi...</i>

520
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,098
<i>not part of our plan.</i>

521
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:08,271
Last time I checked, you left
no shortage of bodies in your wake.

522
00:37:08,348 --> 00:37:12,179
No, I did what I had to do
to get Caroline where she is.

523
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:13,568
Now that she's there,

524
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:16,031
let's not draw any more attention
than we have to.

525
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:18,314
<i>You think getting to the top
is the hard part?</i>

526
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:20,230
She's a hundred times more visible,

527
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,796
<i>has a hundred times more enemies.</i>

528
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:24,229
<i>Anyone who knows anything
has got to be dealt with.</i>

529
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,531
If someone is a liability, they go.

530
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:29,380
Tancredi was becoming a liability.

531
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,432
So is his daughter.

532
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:35,698
Wait. What?

533
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,298
Sara?

534
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,328
Good bye, Paul.

535
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,478
You walk out that door
with those guys right now,

536
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:30,664
and it's only a matter of time
before you get caught.

537
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:31,880
You realize that, don't you?

538
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:34,660
You're not just gonna be dealing
with escape charges, but assault,

539
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:36,143
unlawful imprisonment, kidnapping...

540
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:38,456
- I don't need to hear this right now.
- Oh, no, you do.

541
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:41,253
How much longer do you really think
you can stay ahead of the cops?

542
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:46,301
Look, if you turn yourself in,

543
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,366
I will testify at the sentencing.

544
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:49,639
I will say that you cooperated.

545
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:50,971
That can make a huge difference.

546
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:52,495
- Shut up.
- Be smart.

547
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:54,556
You have a baby on the way.

548
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,129
Do you want to be around
for its second birthday

549
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:58,257
- or its 22nd?
- Shut up.

550
00:38:58,324 --> 00:38:59,588
If you didn't wanna hear me out,

551
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:01,825
if you didn't wanna hear
that you're making a mistake,

552
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,090
you would've gagged me again...

553
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:03,929
Calla-te!

554
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:10,022
Fernando!

555
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,528
Time to go!

556
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,149
You can still do the right thing,
Fernando.

557
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:22,777
Look-a-here.

558
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,189
Look-a-here.

559
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:26,827
Pocket change.

560
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:29,530
In case you want to tip the valet
when you're at the Ritz.

561
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,607
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, boy.

562
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:32,726
Where's Sucre?

563
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:34,684
Right here.

564
00:39:36,162 --> 00:39:37,356
What are you doing?

565
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,169
Drop the bag.

566
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,250
No one's going anywhere.

567
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:02,850
Just so you know, man, I'm not

568
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:04,380
gonna roll on those guys.

569
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:06,297
It ain't gonna happen, so...

570
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,130
if that's what this is about...

571
00:40:13,122 --> 00:40:15,400
We were talking
about confession earlier.

572
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:19,607
And...

573
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:23,931
I think I owe you an apology

574
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:25,942
because I lied to you...

575
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,837
...about Oscar Shales.

576
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:36,678
Smart-ass just kept pushing it, and I...

577
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:39,772
I snapped.

578
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:42,986
Right there.

579
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,033
That's where I put the bullet in him.

580
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,709
I don't care about none of this.

581
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:58,889
Mistake about that is forensics
will tell the whole tale.

582
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:01,595
Powder burns.

583
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,601
The gun was right against his head.

584
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:07,778
Sir...

585
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:10,065
We should go back to...

586
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:12,024
That's what's good
about confession, you know,

587
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:14,931
'cause you say something,
you get it off your chest and...

588
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:17,391
it just goes out there
into the whole world.

589
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:20,420
And I'm so sorry about this, kid,
because I really hope you understand.

590
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,721
I got nothing against you, kid.

591
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:25,989
What are you doing, man?

592
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,879
But they do.
