00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,196
I want a presidential pardon for me

3
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:05,713
and my brother.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,106
You tell me what's going on.

5
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:09,041
I can take care of you.
All I need you to do

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,700
is tell me exactly
what Agent Mahone told you.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,400
I have a job to do,
which I've been made to do.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,667
- Get off the phone.
- Wait!

9
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,292
Stay right where you are.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,200
What if I know
where you can get at $5 million?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,607
Where is it?

12
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,589
I could take you there,
if you didn't have

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,679
to take me back to the States
and turn me back in.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,400
Three tickets, one cabin, one-way.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,510
Nice.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Sir, in just a few minutes

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,000
the president is going to announce
a pardon

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,500
for Burrows and Scofield.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,500
<i>I regret to inform you,
I am stepping down</i>

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,000
as president of the United States.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,790
There's only one thing we can do.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,203
We gotta disappear.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,601
Forever.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
It's very heavy.
What have you got in there?

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,300
About 75 pounds
of none of your business, Pedro.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,500
For your troubles.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,600
Go! Go! Go!

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Please. T-Bag! T-Bag, please!

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,937
I need that money!

30
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,399
Andale, you son of a bitch. ¡Andale!

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
Please, T-Bag, I'm begging you!

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
Please. Please! No!

33
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:24,799
What time does the ship leave?

34
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:25,819
About ten minutes.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,806
I can't believe we're running again.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
It's different now, man.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,300
- You think so?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,900
- We brought the bitch down.
- She stepped down, Linc.

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,200
Because of us.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,200
Yet you're still wanted for murder.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,900
When you came to Fox River...

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,600
Remember what you said?

43
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,542
You said,
"I'm gonna break you out of here."

44
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm alive. You did that.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,290
You want to look for the good
you look there.

46
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,752
Come on, let's just finish
what you started.

47
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,280
<i>...continuing with our top story.</i>

48
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:05,403
<i>Caroline Reynolds made the announcement
just a short while ago</i>

49
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:08,828
<i>that she's stepping down
as president of the United States.</i>

50
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,500
<i>We'll be bringing you
more information as the...</i>

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
Hey, are you all right?

52
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:17,805
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

53
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:18,981
<i>I heard about the president.</i>

54
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:20,035
What does it mean?

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,600
It means it's time to go.

56
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,110
Okay... When?

57
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:26,000
<i>Ten minutes. How far away are you?</i>

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,100
- Five.
- <i>Listen, Sara,</i>

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,700
Linc and I are on the ship.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,041
This is it.

61
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:35,200
There's no turning back now, so...

62
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,979
I know it's not what you wanted
from your life,

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,702
but in case your interested...

64
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,400
there is room for one more.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,574
Michael Scofield, you asking me
to sail off into the sunset with you?

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,500
Well, it's more of a freighter,
but... yes.

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,800
I'll be there.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,500
I'll see you soon.

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
She's heading West on Leadwell.

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,901
All right.

71
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,500
Stay on her, I'll be right there.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,085
What the hell's this?

73
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,400
I tried, boss.

74
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:15,900
You saw how he just took off.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,799
The only thing I'm seeing
is an escaped con,

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,500
who's begging to be taken Nort-ay.

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,600
Okay, look, maybe we could call
the cab company

78
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,351
and find out where T-Bag
was dropped off.

79
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,400
Now, you're talking. I saw some phone...

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,500
What's it going to take for you
to forget you ever found us?

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
There ain't enough pesos in TJ.

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
You sure about that?

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,900
Go ahead, shoot.

84
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,799
But it might not be the best idea
seeing as how I'm the only one

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,900
who knows where your <i>chiquita</i>'s tied up.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Where is Maricruz?

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,700
If I tell you, I'm as good as dead.

88
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,400
Of course if you shoot, so is she.

89
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,300
- You're bluffing me.
- Am I?

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,100
Let me tell you in words
you might be more familiar with.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,500
She's in "the Hole,"

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,300
with enough food and water
to last about three weeks.

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Any longer than that,

94
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,900
your sweet little plum's
gonna dry up like a raisin.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,080
If anything happens to her,
so help me...

96
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,900
Help you? Way I see it, it's you
who's gotta help me.

97
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,602
'Cause you ain't getting your hands
on that girl

98
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:18,400
'til I get my hands on that money.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Guess that makes us partners.

100
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,160
Here we go.

101
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,500
She's not here.

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,600
- Yeah.
- <i>Sara,</i>

103
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
what's the matter?

104
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
The ship is leaving.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,500
- Michael... - What's wrong?

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,410
<i>Sara?</i>

107
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,900
I'm already on board.

108
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,754
I'm sorry, I must have just missed you.
Where are you?

109
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,138
We're on deck.

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,410
Great.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm on my way up.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,010
Love you.

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
We good?

114
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,500
Clear vehicles platform 9!

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Yeah.

116
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,000
Son of a bitch!

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,500
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

118
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,693
No more games, Sara.
You were on your way to see him.

119
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:35,719
No, I wasn't.

120
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,403
You were just compelled to flee
the custody of a Federal Agent?

121
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
I couldn't find her.

122
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:56,623
We got to go back.

123
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:59,771
- You can't. There's nothing you can do.
- There's always something you can do.

124
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:00,786
Not this time.

125
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,100
Not this time, man.

126
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,210
It's done.

127
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,410
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,523
Scofield or prison.

129
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,300
I just wanted a donut, sir.

130
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,122
Get her a donut.

131
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:16,983
Can we get her a donut?
Get her a donut.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Get her a dozen donuts!

133
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,501
Lock her up!

Where the hell did you go, Michael?

137
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
So, where the hell is Mahone?

138
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,209
I don't know, sir.

139
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,799
He's been MIA for the last week or so.

140
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,180
You think he knows
I've been barking up one of his trees?

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,300
Mr. Franklin, good afternoon.

142
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,500
This is Richard Sullins,
director of Internal Affairs at the FBI.

143
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,100
Which means whenever
one of our people does something wrong,

144
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,400
it's my job to make it right.

145
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,800
How right are we talking about?

146
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Well, let's be clear...

147
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,549
You are a convicted felon

148
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,633
who broke out of a state penitentiary.
There's only so much I can do.

149
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:31,200
Well, there's only so much I can say.

150
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Now, I'm sorry if I seem
a little bit skeptical,

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,700
but the last time a federal agent
came up in here offering me a deal,

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,500
there was a string attached...

153
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,579
that I was supposed
to put around my neck.

154
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,900
I've been authorized to offer you
a reduced sentence

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,400
in exchange for your testimony
against Agent Mahone,

156
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700
Instead of 18 years,
you'll be looking at 18 months.

157
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,100
18 months?

158
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,600
Hey, you know what?
That man tried to kill me.

159
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,900
So as soon as he finds out
that I'm singing,

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I probably won't even last 18 days.

161
00:10:57,914 --> 00:11:00,100
He threatened my family.

162
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,700
Now, I need to be out there
protecting them.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
So until you can offer me
something like that...

164
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm not testifying to a damn thing.

165
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Guard!

166
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,600
Free man.

167
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
You <i>and</i> your family.

168
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,700
Witness protection, fresh start.

169
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
Clean record?

170
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,500
Spick-and-span.

171
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,200
You put that in writing
and you got yourself a witness.

172
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,310
Sir?

173
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
I knocked, but...

174
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,200
You okay?

175
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:54,646
What does that look like to you?

176
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,700
There, right there.

177
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,000
It's a triangle.

178
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,200
Yeah, I thought so, too.

179
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,300
How about this? Right there.

180
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,700
It's the mathematical symbol for pi.

181
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,100
3.14.

182
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:09,961
I'm thinking date, area code...

183
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,300
314, that's Missouri.

184
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,100
So you think Scofield's there?

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
I doubt it. How's your Greek alphabet,
Agent Lang?

186
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
I don't know. I guess it's...

187
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,100
What if I told you that triangle
was a delta and that this,

188
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,000
this here was not the symbol pi
but the letter?

189
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,289
I didn't see any of those
in the photos of the tattoos.

190
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,500
They weren't in the tattoos.

191
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,200
We pulled these from his original
sketches off the hard drive.

192
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,100
Scofield numbered all of the steps
of his escape.

193
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:42,811
He kept everything in order that way,
but it looks like he didn't use numbers,

194
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,336
that he used letters like... This is it.

195
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:47,600
A sketch of this tattoo.

196
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,600
Allan Schweitzer marked with an alpha,

197
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,143
first letter of the Greek alphabet.

198
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
First step of his plan.

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,600
Epsilon, fifth letter
of the Greek alphabet.

200
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,737
Fifth step in his plan.

201
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:57,100
Here's theta,

202
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
and kappa...

203
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,901
How about that?

204
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:01,300
Tau? At the border, right?

205
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:03,064
Getting closer to the end.
Are you with me?

206
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,300
So you think...

207
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,600
His omega...

208
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,464
The last letter of the Greek alphabet...

209
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:08,928
is the last step of his plan.

210
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,110
What is that?

211
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
- Christ in a flower?
- A rose.

212
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,399
And these numbers, 6-1-7.

213
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:18,600
Could be biblical: chapter 6, verse 17.

214
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,700
6-1-7, 6-17.

215
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
June 17th.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
What's today?

217
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
The 15th.

218
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,199
So whatever his last step is...

219
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
It's going to happen in two days.

220
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,152
What's he saying?

221
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,500
Nothing. The same as the rest.

222
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,100
Maybe he don't <i>comprende.</i>

223
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,793
What's Spanish for "INS"?

224
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:47,840
Don't be stupid.

225
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:48,900
We're in Mexico.

226
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,099
You're the illegal one here.

227
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,084
Hey, it doesn't mean he ain't got family
up north trying to clean their way

228
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:55,163
to a green card.
He knows what I'm talking about.

229
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,700
Oh, you are too good to me, Suzi-Q.

230
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,300
Just how I like it.

231
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,800
How did I get so lucky?

232
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,500
Oh, no, Teddy Bear.

233
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm the lucky one.

234
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
The day I met you...

235
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,300
was the day I was born.

236
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,123
We're out of time.

237
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,641
No, Susan...

238
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,921
We got our whole lives together.

239
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,900
No, I mean, the hour is up.

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
I'll take care of you plenty, okay?

241
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:19,244
And since we're rolling here,
so let's, you know, get back...

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,857
How's it... Was cooking, good looking?

243
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,200
I would really feel better
if you paid me up front.

244
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,900
And I told you up front
that if you did this right,

245
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,700
I would take care of you, so...

246
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,500
You paid me for an hour.

247
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,300
The hour is up.

248
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:37,211
If I you want me to stay,
I need more money.

249
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,760
Great, great, you ruined it.

250
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,810
Thanks.

251
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,833
You know, for a second there,
I was actually like,

252
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,379
"This chick has a brain in her head."

253
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Then, if you did, you wouldn't be
a street whore, right?

254
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,824
You know,

255
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,700
I don't know who this Suzi-Q bitch is,

256
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,100
but no wonder she wants nothing
to do with you.

257
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,300
You didn't just call her a bitch,
did you?

258
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Okay.

1
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
I am going to count to three,

2
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,977
and if you don't put your arm down,

3
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm going to scream.

4
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,700
One, t...

5
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,900
We made it.

6
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Not yet.

7
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
First there's someone we need to see.

8
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,900
Okay, who's got what?

9
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,743
Christ as a rose
is a pretty common theme

10
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,000
that runs through the Bible.

11
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,145
Martin Luther adopted it
as his coat of arms.

12
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:07,395
And there's the belief
that Christ rose from the dead.

13
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,100
This is Scofield's final step,
a new life.

14
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,855
Could be something there.

15
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,800
You... keep track of this on the board.

16
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,000
- Where's Wheeler?
- Here we go.

17
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,673
The Harmonists:
first settlers of New Harmony, Indiana,

18
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:22,700
used a golden rose as their symbol
for Christ.

19
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,310
That's a reach.

20
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,399
There's a flower called the
<i>Christmas Rose</i>.

21
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Wasn't <i>Christ Rose</i>
a German code name

22
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
for, uh, the counterattack by the Nazis
that led

23
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,700
to the Battle of the Bulge?

24
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Where was that?

25
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,100
Ardennes Forest
on the Belgium-Germany border.

26
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,900
Not a bad place to hide
if they can find it.

27
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,100
You gonna look into that?

28
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
- Yeah.
- All right, what else?

29
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,100
Christ actually rose from the dead
on Easter.

30
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Easter Sunday...

31
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,700
Who's got Scofield's file?

32
00:17:58,268 --> 00:17:59,300
Um, here we go.

33
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,874
- Christ in a rose.
- Yeah, what about it?

34
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,400
Scofield's mother's name.

35
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:20,800
Christina Rose Scofield.

36
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,600
But I thought she was dead.

37
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,100
Well, so did I.

38
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,800
So did I.

39
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,500
The very first thing that Scofield did

40
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,700
when they broke out of Fox River
is he picked up

41
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,792
a bunch of supplies that he had
stashed in a grave.

42
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:39,500
I want you to find out
where Scofield's mother's buried.

43
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,710
And what ?

44
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,800
And see if she's buried.

45
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,610
Yes, sir.

46
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
- What about Panama ?
- What about Panama ?

47
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,833
His hard drive

48
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,737
was full of information
about Central America,

49
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Panama in particular.

50
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,000
Which he knows you have.

51
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,373
The guy's got all kinds of hubris,

52
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:55,300
but he's smart enough
to stay out of a country

53
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,016
where he knows
you'll be waiting for him.

54
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,952
Unless there's something there
that he needs.

55
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,800
Or someone.

56
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,300
I want a map of Panama,

57
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,300
and find out if Scofield's mom,
Christina Rose,

58
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
has any family in Central America,

59
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,700
any property, anything.

60
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,312
The last time I was on a bus like this,
I was heading to Fox River.

61
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,100
This country's amazing.

62
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
It's beautiful.

63
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,500
- What's that smell, man ?
- Bananas.

64
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,800
And sugar cane.
That's Panama's biggest exports.

65
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Come on.

66
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,777
you've been talking about Panama
and bumpy bus rides

67
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,991
ever since we broke out,
and now that we're doing it...

68
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:43,447
She should have been here with us.

69
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,399
We got all the time in the world
for that.

70
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,500
One day,
you and Sara...

71
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,200
Can we just get there, please ?

72
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Sure.

73
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,800
Oye! Tipo! Espera!

74
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,200
So far, no hits on any connection

75
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,900
between Scofield's mother and Panama.

76
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,500
But there are 38 listings
of Christina Rose

77
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
in various combinations of first name,
middle name and last name.

78
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,900
All right, cross-reference the names
with the numbers 6-1-7

79
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,800
from the tattoo. Maybe it's not a date.

80
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,893
- See if it's an address, P. O. box.
- Got it.

81
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:20,947
If anybody pops, call the Embassy,
have them send

82
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,990
an officer to pick up the woman
for questioning.

83
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,500
Um, I don't think we can just arrest
a foreign citizen

84
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,318
- without any...
- Patriot Act, Agent Lang.

85
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,107
I could arrest your grandmother
for anything, if I wanted to,

86
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:32,399
If anybody's helping Scofield,

87
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,374
dead or alive,
I want to know who they are.

88
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
That her?

89
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,106
Yeah.

90
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,705
<i>Hola</i>, Mrs. Vasquez.

91
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:56,901
You're late.

92
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,992
It's much later than the date you said.

93
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,534
Well, we ran into
a little bit of trouble.

94
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:03,029
Who is this?

95
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:06,225
It's a business associate.

96
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,886
Christina Rose.

97
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,562
I remember.

98
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:12,178
You will find her here.

99
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:13,720
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

100
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:14,782
<i>Gracias.</i>

101
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,497
I'll meet you outside.

102
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,198
I forgot to ask something.

103
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,368
All right.

104
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:31,976
Do you have a phone I could use?

105
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,539
I need an international operator,
please.

106
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:43,354
United States.

107
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:47,724
It's 312-346...

108
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,812
- What the hell are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

109
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:51,824
You can't.

110
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:54,503
We don't even know
if she's alive or dead, Linc.

111
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:56,831
If Sara's in custody,
they got her phone.

112
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,983
You want to get caught?

113
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:19,360
Three things I hate, Alex.

114
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,237
Traffic, hockey,

115
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:23,754
and calling you with the same question
over and over.

116
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:25,596
Then don't call me anymore,
but I do believe

117
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:27,169
the brothers <i>are</i> in Panama.

118
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,131
<i>- Is that so?</i>
- The key to exactly where

119
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:30,539
is on one of Scofield's tattoos.

120
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:33,818
While I'm thrilled
you've narrowed it down to a country,

121
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:35,649
that's not why we're talking.

122
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,701
Benjamin Miles Franklin is alive...

123
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:39,311
I'm aware of that, yeah.

124
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:42,209
... and being released from custody.

125
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,336
That's not possible, they would need
permission from my office.

126
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:46,990
Good to know you're on top of things.

127
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,006
Find me Agent Wheeler.

128
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:02,647
He'll see you now.

129
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:18,315
Forgive me for asking, sir, but...

130
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,580
couldn't we be doing this in my office?

131
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:22,070
It'd be much more comfortable.

132
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,813
I felt we needed to speak freely.

133
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:28,529
For the next several hours,
this is what those

134
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,105
in the intelligence community refer to
as a "blind spot."

135
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:33,362
Something to do
with the position of the sun, I'm told.

136
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,289
Disrupts long-distance
recording devices.

137
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:41,412
If I may apologize again, sir, for...

138
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,940
the unfortunate outcome
with the President.

139
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,560
I know how important she was
to our interests, and I assure you

140
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:48,535
- that moving forward--
- You won't be moving

141
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:51,499
anywhere until you can explain to me
how this happened.

142
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,128
The brothers...

143
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:00,175
- They're making it--
- Still alive.

144
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,524
Yes. It appears
they were able to flee the country.

145
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:08,538
To where?

146
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:11,039
Mr. Mahone seems to believe
they're in Panama.

147
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:23,531
Does our Mr. Mahone know
where exactly in Panama they are?

148
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:24,953
Not yet.

149
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:27,591
Why?

150
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,355
How much do you know about Sona,
Mr. Kim?

151
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,544
Only what I've been given clearance on.

152
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:35,765
Perhaps what our situation requires

153
00:25:36,572 --> 00:25:38,171
is a change in strategy.

154
00:25:44,463 --> 00:25:46,868
How long until the court
approves the warrant for Mahone?

155
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:47,899
<i>Should be anytime now.</i>

156
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,946
<i>We're just waiting for the indictment
to come down.</i>

157
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:51,663
Okay, I've got a question for you.

158
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,455
What if he's in there?
I can't keep avoiding him.

159
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:56,963
He reads people.
That's what he does.

160
00:25:57,092 --> 00:25:58,953
And if he finds out
that I'm involved in this,

161
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:00,815
I'm gonna need some protection from...

162
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,840
Relax. Take a breath.

163
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,615
Mahone can only read
what you write for him.

164
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:06,746
Can you act normal?

165
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,392
<i>That's all you have to do.
The last thing we want is for him</i>

166
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:12,415
<i>to get spooked and take off.
This is all gonna be over soon.</i>

167
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,323
All right. Thank you.

168
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:16,456
No. Thank <i>you</i>.

169
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,229
Where you been?

170
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,658
I got to do this.

171
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:41,895
What are you doing, Alex?
I'm not wearing a wire.

172
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,430
You're gonna tell me
what's going on here?

173
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:45,435
In old England...

174
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,677
The punishment for a traitorous act

175
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:49,729
was beheading.

176
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:52,660
Following the execution,

177
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:55,095
they would hold up the severed head
by the hair.

178
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:57,164
Not, as we think,
for the crowd to see the head,

179
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:59,601
but for the head
to see the crowd, because...

180
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,934
Consciousness sticks around
for another 8 seconds.

181
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,811
The idea was
that it would give the traitor

182
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:05,194
one more chance to take a look at--

183
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,520
You don't want to do this, okay?

184
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,210
Just take a moment...

185
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:11,133
If you're gonna stab me in the back,
Agent Wheeler,

186
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,346
be smart enough
to cover up the knife.

187
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:14,493
You go and visit Franklin

188
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:15,536
three times this week,

189
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,560
called Sullins, what, twice a day?

190
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,920
Didn't you learn anything
working for me?

191
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:22,803
You got to cover your tracks,
unless you...

192
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,854
Unless you want to get caught.

193
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:34,474
You wanted me to know it was you.

194
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:40,209
You're a killer, Alex.

195
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:41,609
Is that so?

196
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,662
Soil samples taken from your yard

197
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,123
in connection with the disappearance
of Oscar Shales.

198
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:48,193
Forensics is prepared to submit a report

199
00:27:48,194 --> 00:27:50,502
detailing the irregularities
in the shooting

200
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,774
of David "Tweener" Apolskis.

201
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:54,552
There's your blatant disregard
for protocol

202
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:55,777
in the death of John Abruzzi--

203
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:59,053
And the escaped con who says
that I told him to kill himself.

204
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:01,922
You think his testimony
is gonna send you

205
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:03,357
into the promised land.

206
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,636
You can erase me, too.

207
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:11,719
But it's not gonna erase
the very real fact

208
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,064
that you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison.

209
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,533
You know...

210
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,362
You remind me of myself
when I was a young agent.

211
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:24,897
What?

212
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:28,434
I wish I could take that
as a compliment.

213
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:32,980
That's some real fine work, Wheeler.

214
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:34,280
Good job.

215
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:37,170
Don't you let anyone scare you...

216
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:40,042
into doing the wrong thing.

217
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:46,859
Let me take you in.

218
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:49,199
Whatever mess you're in,
we can clean it up.

219
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,073
There's only one way to clean this.

220
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:52,397
One way.

221
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:01,927
Got a visitor.

222
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,376
- Yeah, who?
- I don't know.

223
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:06,284
I was just instructed to bring you down.

224
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:07,514
Look, I ain't going nowhere

225
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:09,647
until you tell me who it is I'm meeting,
all right?

226
00:29:11,656 --> 00:29:14,051
You got to stop it!
Listen to me for a second!

227
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:15,994
All you got to do
is go out there and check.

228
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,941
The guy's kind of tall, okay?

229
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,367
It's the least that you can do.

230
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,900
What?

231
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:28,201
Daddy!

232
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,615
Oh, my God.

233
00:29:30,162 --> 00:29:31,168
Come here.

234
00:29:33,378 --> 00:29:35,002
Daddy loves you so much.

235
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,601
So.. is it real?

236
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,583
He says you're gonna go free,

237
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:54,153
that we don't have to run anymore.

238
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:56,700
I mean, what happened?
What changed?

239
00:29:57,781 --> 00:29:59,002
Don't you worry about it.

240
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:01,588
You just know
that your man handles things.

241
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:02,662
Ain't that right?

242
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
That's right.

243
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:07,312
I don't believe it, but okay.

244
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:11,622
Benjamin,
if I could just have a quick word.

245
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,407
Why don't you go down the hall
for just a quick second.

246
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:21,897
Okay? I'll be right there.

247
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:29,180
Here it is.

248
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,178
New address,

249
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,190
new identities.

250
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:34,057
The prosecutor will get in touch
with you

251
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:36,606
to go over your testimony,
so you just make sure you show up

252
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:38,615
where he says and when he says.

253
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:39,892
Yeah, okay.

254
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:42,781
But I'm a free man, right?

255
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:44,506
Free man.

256
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:49,215
Wait a minute.

257
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,403
What about Mahone?

258
00:30:51,404 --> 00:30:52,957
I don't wanna live in fear

259
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,187
for the rest of my life, see?

260
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,761
You let me worry about Mahone.

261
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,881
You just worry
about staying out of trouble.

262
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:00,673
You ain't gonna have a problem
with that, trust me.

263
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:02,145
Don't screw it up.

1
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,837
How much further?

2
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:27,061
Not far.

3
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,195
For what it's worth,

4
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:31,344
no one forced Sara to do what she did.

5
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:35,252
Whatever gets you through the night.

6
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:36,617
The hell does that mean?

7
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:39,364
- I didn't ask you to use her.
- It's not that simple.

8
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:41,101
Whatever gets you
through the night, buddy.

9
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:42,764
You know what amazes me, Linc?

10
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,955
Nothing ever registers with you.

11
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:47,004
Ever.

12
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,291
Just rolls right off your back,
doesn't it?

13
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:52,281
We ruined Sara's life
and it's like you don't even care.

14
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,962
- That what you think?
- We're here,

15
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:55,248
and Sara's back there in prison.

16
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:57,261
- Does it seem fair to you?
- None of it's fair.

17
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,971
Just don't make this about
boy loses girl.

18
00:31:58,972 --> 00:32:00,145
Who should it be about, Linc?

19
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:02,331
Westmoreland? Tweener?

20
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:04,196
- LJ? LJ's mom?
- Let me stop you right there.

21
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:06,122
Remember the name of the guard
that was murdered

22
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:08,047
- because of the riot I started?
- Shut up.

23
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:09,927
Do you even remember his name?
- Shut up.

24
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,801
I bet you remember
Veronica's name, don't you?

25
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,638
You mention her name again,
I swear to God...

26
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:14,677
What about T-Bag?

27
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,486
Linc, he's out there, now,
because of us!

28
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:17,934
You and me!

29
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:22,699
Every life he takes,

30
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:25,996
that's blood on our hands.

31
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:28,228
And for what?

32
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,163
I didn't ask you to do what you did.

33
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,923
They were gonna kill you, Linc!

34
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:37,867
Well, maybe you should've let them!

35
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:40,150
Take that back.

36
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,352
As bad as I feel about Sara,

37
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:10,834
she had a choice.

38
00:33:12,285 --> 00:33:13,307
Veronica didn't.

39
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:19,604
I listened to her die, Michael.

40
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:21,185
I listened to her die, and there was...

41
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:23,034
there was nothing I could do.

42
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,747
Nothing.

43
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,074
We've lost so much, man.

44
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,721
We can't afford to lose each other.

45
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:38,834
We just can't.

46
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,188
You going somewhere, Alex?

47
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:10,147
I don't know. Am I?

48
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,466
Come on.

49
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,730
You know
I don't like
to get my hands dirty.

50
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:24,329
It's surprising the things a man will do

51
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,099
when properly motivated.

52
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:30,081
Wasn't it you who told me that?

53
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:33,598
You know, I would kill you right now
if I thought

54
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,399
it would give me an ounce of peace.

55
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,079
And what would give you peace?

56
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:43,136
I've been able to hold it together

57
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:44,974
through all this...

58
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,382
because there was a light
at the end of the tunnel.

59
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:50,033
Life...

60
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:51,727
at the end of the tunnel,

61
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:53,697
for me, for my family.

62
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:55,908
And now what?

63
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:57,545
Do you see my son?

64
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,593
Do you see my wife?

65
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:01,800
What have I got?

66
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,257
What have you given me?

67
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,449
What if I was to tell you

68
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:09,640
that there was something
that could turn that light...

69
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:11,863
back on?

70
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:13,686
What would you say?

71
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:15,143
I'd say it's the same offer you made

72
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:17,299
when you dragged me into this,
you little bastard.

73
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:18,894
And look where it's got me now.

74
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,663
They're gonna drag me before the public.

75
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,478
They've gonna prosecute me like...

76
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,998
like some kind of murderer.

77
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,718
There's... There's evidence.

78
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:29,237
Really hard, tangible evidence,
that you can't take away.

79
00:35:29,317 --> 00:35:30,549
You're right...

80
00:35:32,645 --> 00:35:34,604
but I can help you get away.

81
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,060
And at this point,

82
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,087
I don't think
you've got any other options.

83
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:45,763
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell was apprehended
in Mexico.

84
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,130
Oh, let me guess. You want him dead.

85
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:52,180
There's been a...

86
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:54,217
change in strategy.

87
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,618
We're gonna need him alive.

88
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:58,800
I'm talking about a very real

89
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:00,535
finish line here, Alex.

90
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:02,663
You've come so far.

91
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,447
How much further would I have to go?

92
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,576
Well, you're lucky.

93
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:11,214
For this, you only have to go to Panama.

94
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,498
I'm trying to remember
the last time our lives

95
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,204
made any kind of sense.

96
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:26,340
Before Mom died.

97
00:36:26,715 --> 00:36:28,309
When it was just the three of us.

98
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:33,549
Well, there she is.

99
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:43,641
Hello, Lang.

100
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:45,440
What's going on?
I mean, there's all kinds

101
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,451
of suits over here
going through your office.

102
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:48,909
I'll explain later.

103
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:50,684
All right.

104
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:54,575
- Did you get the fax?
- No. Why?

105
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:56,031
What do you got?

106
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,662
<i>Some information on Christina Rose
you might find interesting.</i>

107
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:01,262
Looks like she was commissioned
about four months before

108
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,765
Scofield robbed that bank

109
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,013
by a builder in Panama
named Amparo Vasquez.

110
00:37:06,103 --> 00:37:07,465
Son of a bitch.

111
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:19,971
She's beautiful.

112
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,307
Yeah, she's not the real thing, but...

113
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:23,833
So where to, man?

114
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,896
- So, is it really over?
- Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's really over.

115
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,114
What is it, baby?

116
00:37:58,088 --> 00:37:59,584
Oh, nothing.

117
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,295
Let's go home.

118
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:16,990
Okay, so we checked the train station

119
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:19,771
in Malinalco,
the bus depot in Puebla,

120
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,531
and just about every hotel there is.

121
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,156
Hey, hey, hey, slow down, Sancho.

122
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,534
<i>Uno momento.</i>

123
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:30,895
It's for you.

124
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,148
That was the guy
from the tourism bureau.

125
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:43,681
- He found him.
- Where?

126
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,519
An E. Stammel just boarded a plane
to Panama City.

127
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,911
What the hell's he doing in Panama?

128
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:15,532
You speak English?

129
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:19,274
Say... "Good morning, Teddy."

130
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:21,951
Good morning, Teddy.

131
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:24,627
So then, actually, no,
you don't speak English.

132
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,038
<i>Hablan ingles</i> around here?

133
00:39:37,138 --> 00:39:38,426
Say, "Good morning, Teddy."

134
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,178
Good morning, Teddy.

135
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,074
Say, "Good morning, Teddy Bear."

136
00:39:45,146 --> 00:39:47,082
Good morning, Teddy Bear.

137
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:50,401
Do you like wigs?

138
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,103
For the right money, I like anything.

139
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:32,243
There's nothing.

140
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:34,330
Nothing online about Sara's arrest.

141
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:35,915
Maybe they're keeping it quiet.

142
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:38,458
What about the message board?
The Goldfinch thing?

143
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:41,368
Just something from C-Note and...

144
00:40:42,632 --> 00:40:44,448
There is a message from Sucre.

145
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:46,055
Still running, huh?

146
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,191
What?

147
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:57,165
Sucre says T-Bag's here, in Panama.

148
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:59,014
How the hell does he know?

149
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,534
I don't know. It says,

150
00:41:00,613 --> 00:41:01,797
"The Bag's still has the bag.

151
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:04,268
"He's in Panama City
at the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

152
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,806
"If you're there and want to help
put that bird back in a cage,

153
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:08,492
"let me know. Sucre."

154
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:11,267
What the hell is that son of a bitch
doing in Panama?

155
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,969
- We gotta go after him.
- Just let it be!

156
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,995
We don't need the money.

157
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,850
It's not about the money, Linc.

158
00:41:15,962 --> 00:41:17,505
Whatever good we do from here on out,

159
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,666
it doesn't matter
as long as T-Bag's out there.

160
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,372
- We made it.
- Too much has gone wrong.

161
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:22,373
If we could just...

162
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,273
If we could just make this right.

163
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:28,591
Panama City, is only an hour away.

164
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,136
And now we know where he's staying.

165
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:31,703
So call the police.

166
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,262
There's a reason I chose Panama.

167
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:35,047
There's no extradition laws.

168
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:36,767
They're not gonna touch him.

169
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:38,231
So what are you gonna do?

170
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:40,830
I'll figure something out.

171
00:41:40,888 --> 00:41:42,378
Figure it out? You don't take a piss

172
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:44,021
without a plan, man. Come on.

173
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,796
Look at me! I never think things through

174
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,141
and look where it got me.

175
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,525
- Yeah, Panama and a boat-load of booze.
- You got me that.

176
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:50,957
I got me a death sentence.

177
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:52,149
Look, let's just...

178
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,244
get out to sea, think things through,

179
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:58,298
when the time's right, we make it right.

180
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:23,632
<i>Trans Panamanian Airlines,</i>

181
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:25,813
<i>Flight 271 to Panama,</i>

182
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:28,207
<i>now boarding all First Class passengers.</i>

183
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:31,184
<i>Again, we are now boarding
for Panama City.</i>

184
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:32,942
See you soon.

185
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:38,741
Home sweet home.

186
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:46,668
I got the booze, but the limes are shot.
