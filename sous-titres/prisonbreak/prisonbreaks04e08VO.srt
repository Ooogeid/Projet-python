1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,210
previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,900
If scylla was like a pizza,
all we got is a slice.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,980
So scylla isn't one card.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,840
It's six.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,070
How long has it been happening?

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,970
It's not a big deal.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,510
It was a big deal when you were 13.

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,980
Michael told you about mom?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,740
No.

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,920
As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,600
In her 30s, they started up again.

12
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,410
How old was your mom
when she passed away?

13
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,920
Who's that?

14
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,580
That's the man that killed my son.

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,770
yes?

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,510
It's like a digital black hole.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,870
It swallows up any electronic
data within ten feet.

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,740
Mr. Glenn?

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,000
We got a problem.

20
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,680
What's that do?

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,570
It's a battery pack for
a video game console.

22
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,100
You'll need to buy a new one.

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,160
Scylla. Get it to me by tomorrow
and you will receive 50% of the fee.

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,770
Two days, 25%.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,180
Three days, I shoot
you through the brain.

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,570
who is this?

27
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,660
Hello, michael.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,690
<i>CHICAGO 2001</i>

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,220
You know what?

30
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,490
If crab ever throws a psycho at us
like this again, I'm going to kill him.

31
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,530
Yeah, but if we don't get this
psycho, crab's going to kill us.

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,830
Just have the burner ready.

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,120
Got it covered.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,250
After this job, I'm done, man.

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,780
I can't do this anymore.

36
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,010
What do you think crab
will say about that?

37
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,710
I don't care what crab says about that.

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,750
How can I be a good father
if I'm always in prison?

39
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,840
I missed out on my kid's childhood.

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,390
I'm not going to miss
out on him becoming a man.

41
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,570
You know, not for nothing, but
this plan is crazy even for you.

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,070
You sure this is the only way?

43
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah.

44
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,920
Hey look. He's coming
out. He's got the case.

45
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,800
let's buckle up.

46
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,060
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

47
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,400
You're welcome. Let's go!

48
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,850
So wait a minute. This
is your brilliant plan?

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,810
You're going to pull a kamikaze
mission on the general's car?

50
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,210
Now that the device is gone,
your opinion doesn't matter.

51
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,740
So shut up and pump.

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,090
We know the general travels light.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,420
One limo and a couple of guards.

54
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,180
It ain't the guards I'm
worried about; it's the crash.

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,170
Look, I never said this
was going to be easy.

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,700
Just relax.

57
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,610
First off, panama was a job.

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,000
Some other time.

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,230
What do you want with scylla?

60
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,240
That's my business.

61
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,380
We're not in panama anymore,
and I'm not behind a fence,

62
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,560
so, again, what do you want with scylla?

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,890
Same thing you want:
Bring down the company.

64
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,820
Great.

65
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,120
Then why don't you give me those
missing pages and disappear?

66
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,170
I'd love to.

67
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,980
You remember that day at the roosevelt
when whistler made off with lief's card?

68
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,990
Who do you think took the fall for that?

69
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,430
Our names are at the
top of the same hit list.

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,630
Now, I don't know what arrangement you
two have, but I need some traveling money.

71
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,540
Let's talk about that later.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,330
Why don't we talk about the kind of scum
you're willing to put on the payroll?

73
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,980
Give me a way to do it
without her, and we'll do it.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,060
We need the pages.

75
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,100
It's a package deal.

76
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,030
Are we partners?

77
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,940
Partners.

78
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,490
Look, I barely dropped a nickel in
the slots, right? This guy was all...

79
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,140
we ought to blanket party your ass.

80
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,380
Where's the device?

81
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,100
- Can it be salvaged?
- Tell him.

82
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,880
Pit boss walked off with it.

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,140
Okay. Well, we're going to
call this your early retirement.

84
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,870
You can either go upstairs and sit on your
cot and ride ut the rest of this thing,

85
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,570
or I can call agent self and you can
ride out the rest of your prison sentence.

86
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,270
Your choice.

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,260
I need to talk to you.

88
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,140
So your brother told me
about your nosebleeds.

89
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,190
And he told me about your mom.

90
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,520
That wasn't his place.

91
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,570
To be worried about you?

92
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,440
When mom got sick, linc was
at the hospital every day,

93
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,680
holding her hand, watching
her die, and he was 13.

94
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,110
It changed him. It
made him overprotective.

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,550
And now he's jumping to all the wrong
conclusions for all the wrong reasons, and it'S...

96
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,200
it's over nothing because I'm fine.

97
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,490
You don't look fine.

98
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,060
Well, maybe that's because there's
something I have to tell you.

99
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,970
Gretchen's alive.

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,650
She's working with t-bag, and they have
several pages from whistler's bird book,

104
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,650
and they want in on scylla.

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,600
Self is cutting them a deal as we speak.

106
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,690
Self knows that they
have their own agenda,

107
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,600
but so do we and as soon
as we get those pages back,

108
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,190
gretchen and t-bag are
going to pay for everything.

109
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,620
They're going to get exactly
what's coming to them.

110
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,830
Okay.

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,220
This isn't about gretchen. It's
not about any one person. And we...

112
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,350
we have to finish it.

113
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,020
I need a minute.

114
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,980
Please.

115
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,370
I can't believe this!

116
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,050
What choice do we have?

117
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,300
Gretchen's on the team. Like
it or not, we need those pages.

118
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,260
Another perra we're jumping in bed with?

119
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,810
Not exactly new territory for us.

120
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,280
I don't care who we
gotta partner up with.

121
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,370
We get those papers, we make with
the break-in, we get this job done.

122
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,900
She could still have
ties to the company, man.

123
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,470
I don't know.

124
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,180
We'll worry about gretchen
when the time is right.

125
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,070
For now, let's focus on the general.

126
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,550
This thing with gretchen
doesn't change a thing.

127
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,370
We're, uh... we're still close.

128
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,330
Closer to scylla, farther from wyatt.

129
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,430
You don't know that. Just
stay focused, all rht?

130
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,180
This is my focus, okay?

131
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,350
I'm doing the job, okay?
All right? All right?

132
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,040
Every day, the trail to my son's
killer gets a little bit colder.

133
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,700
That's all I do is focus.

134
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,520
What are you doing?

135
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,260
it's just...

136
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,050
we're going to need that downstairs.

137
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,130
Yeah. I'll just, uh... be up here.

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,240
How much.......

139
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,230
I see you two have come to an agreement.

140
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,870
She's on work release, just like you.

141
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,540
What kind of work?

142
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,620
You and the secretary keep things quiet in
the office while michael tunnels to scylla.

143
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,210
you really think scofield's
gonna keep his word, huh?

144
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,230
You horsewhipped the woman he loves.

145
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,350
Michael wants scylla
just as badly as we do.

146
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,150
Yeah, he wanted out of prison, too.

147
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,520
Our partnership lasted long enough
for that to happen, and then...

148
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,720
we parted ways. Trust me.

149
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,700
Yeah, um, go on in, sir.

150
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,190
Scofield will use you and then he's gonna bury the
knife in your back for what you did to his lady friend.

151
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,300
Mr. Pfeiffer. Cole.

152
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,820
where's scylla?

153
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,130
Good morning to you,
too, sir. Gentlemen.

154
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,770
I gave you three days. Where's scylla?

155
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,900
now, uh, mr. Feng, let's
not do anything rash.

156
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,160
So you're feng.

157
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,950
We haven't actually met in person.

158
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,930
I was the liaison between the company and
your chinese employers on operation copperhead.

159
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,190
Susan?

160
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
That's right.

161
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,310
You went from working for the company to
stealing the one thing that could destroy them.

162
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,420
That's a tight turn.

163
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,020
With a price that scylla commands on
the open market, anybody would turn.

164
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,160
Which is, by the way, 200.

165
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,040
Our paths never crossed on copperhead,

166
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,390
but I did deal with one of your
colleagues; a less-capable associate.

167
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,060
Whatever happened to him?

168
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,380
He was skinned and
hung from an overpass.

169
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,800
Oh, yes, I recall.

170
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,560
He couldn't deliver on promises made.

171
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,920
You may also recall that
he was my predecessor.

172
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,210
When I joined copperhead,
you got what you wanted.

173
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,840
You'll get scylla, too.

174
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,170
If I don't, I'll peel
you like a wet grape.

175
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,100
And the price is 100.

176
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,180
Don't disappoint me.

177
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,050
Well, 125...

178
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,010
million.

179
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,810
Well, then, susan, gretchen,
whatever your name is,

180
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,280
I suggest you find a way to bury the
hatchet with michael scofield's woman.

181
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,680
We got work to do.

182
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,260
Why do I get the feeling that some poor bastard
woke up to an empty driveway this morning?

183
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,180
Relax, we got it from a scrap yard.

184
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,820
And you're pinning the hopes of
the entire mission on that relic?

185
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,610
If it was card one, I'd say no.

186
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,770
If this was card five, I'd
say no, but it's the last card.

187
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,500
I really think we can stage a
hit-and-run and get away with it.

188
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,540
All right, we know where this guy works.

189
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,510
We know his route.

190
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,810
I'm gonna wait for him
at this intersection.

191
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,240
He drives through.

192
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,330
I smash him with my car, get the card.

193
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,050
And if by some miracle you
walked away from the crash,

194
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,820
the general's gonna know
that you ripped him off.

195
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,000
Not if I pump him
full of morphine first.

196
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,240
The general's gonna wake up tomorrow
morning in the hospital feeling happy

197
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,230
as a clam with no idea
what happened to him.

198
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,140
When he's out cold, we download the card onto
the laptop and put the original back on him.

199
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,460
And you don't think this is gonna look suspicious
for the paramedics that show up at the scene?

200
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,490
That depends on who the paramedics are.

201
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,440
At the federal impound lot downtown, there are currently
four ambulances seized in a drug-smuggling ring.

202
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,350
All we need is one.

203
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,040
Go make yourself useful.

204
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,330
Time was commanders would assemble
their troops before a battle

205
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,370
and rehearse schemes of maneuver on a square
of dirt using rocks to depict enemy positions.

206
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,130
They called these
rehearsals "rock drills."

207
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,890
Laos was our rock drill.

208
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,680
Now...

209
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,420
it's time for the battle to commence.

210
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,720
Griffin.

211
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,190
Flooding the laotian market with
counterfeit kip was highly effective.

212
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:07,380
In phase two, the effect will take longer,
but the result will inevitably be the same.

213
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,980
I'm signing off on the order to open
up the next theater of operations.

214
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,490
Excuse me.

215
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
The message is untraceable.

216
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,480
Someone went to a lot of
trouble to cover their tracks.

217
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,950
How do we know this person
can deliver the brothers?

218
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,840
We don'T.

219
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,820
Bait the hook. See if he bites.

220
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,890
Hey-hey, my friend!

221
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,820
Who the hell are you?

222
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,260
Don self, homeland security.

223
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,690
Phil stroger.

224
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,880
- How's it going?
- Good.

225
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,690
This is a grande. This
thing cost me nine bucks.

226
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,500
You california types
and your gourmet coffee.

227
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,220
Hey, can I help you with something?

228
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,360
This is a federal impound lot, correct?

229
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,960
Yeah.

230
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,750
Okay, I think it's pretty
obvious, phil, I need a car.

231
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,430
So you told sara about
the nosebleeds, huh?

232
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,310
I'm worried about you.

233
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,790
Well, why don't you stop starting
fires that I have to put out?

234
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,640
Mom couldn't outrun this.
What makes you think you...

235
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,030
It's not mom, all right? That was
20 years ago. This is different.

236
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,910
It's totally different.

237
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,970
get in.

238
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,180
So my section chief comes over to
the rookie's stretcher and he goes,

239
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,650
"you got one hell of a
workman's comp claim, kid."

240
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,720
hey, uh, let's get that
trip ticket started.

241
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,700
Looks like I can hook you up
with a sedan for your stakeout.

242
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,690
You know what, phil? I gotta go.

243
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,600
What are you talking about?

244
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,680
I just remembered. I got to give a
briefing to a bunch of higher-ups.

245
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,720
Can I come back for the sedan?

246
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,550
Suit yourself, self.

247
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,180
I'll be back.

248
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,630
don self.

249
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,180
I need you to deliver a message.

250
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,950
Okay.

251
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,550
I see your boyfriend's no longer sporting
the latest fashion in gps technology.

252
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,630
So, if neither one of you are wearing ankle
monitors, what are you still doing here?

253
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,270
You should be having hot fugitive sex in every
cash only no-tell motel from here to mexico.

254
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,980
Some things are more important
than what two people want, roland.

255
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,810
I honestly hope that someday
that makes sense to you.

256
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,320
Look, sara...

257
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,990
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,270
For vegas.

259
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm sorry for vegas.

260
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,200
hello?

261
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,120
Listen, I have a message
for you from gretchen.

262
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,030
She wants to meet with you tonight at
7:00 P.M.At the safari motel on 109.

263
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,900
Why?

264
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,720
She says she wants to clear
the air, whatever that means.

265
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,620
Sara?

266
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm not interested.

267
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,410
Okay.

268
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,210
I got a bad feeling about this.

269
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,600
I'm the one on point. You're in the
ambulance. Why are you so worried?

270
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,870
I just got a feeling.

271
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,390
If anything should happen,
call my mom in chicago.

272
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,970
Tell her I didn't die like a damn
convict locked up in some penitentiary.

273
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,720
Nothing's gonna happen.

274
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,430
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,220
Me and sucre got this.

276
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,460
I know you do.

277
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,570
Good luck.

278
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,440
All right.

279
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,500
1 million
-........

280
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,640
I'm in position.

281
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,800
Got it, alex. The rest of us are
standing by at the intersection.

282
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,170
No one's expecting you to
actually treat this bastard, right?

283
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,370
Yeah, I'm still a doctor.

284
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,060
Sucre, how you guys doing?

285
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,730
Got to be kidding me.

286
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,340
Sucre, you copy?

287
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,590
We're good.

288
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,000
Being as I was the original recipient
of the late mr. Whistler's artwork...

289
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,360
what's my cut?

290
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,380
$25 million.

291
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,260
just so you know, I have a
very keen sense of ownership.

292
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:53,110
Six headstones in coosa county
cemetery can attest to that fact.

293
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:59,810
The names on those grave markers took a six
pack of schlitz I had cooling in the river.

294
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,430
That particular transgression
put me back five bucks.

295
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,810
Imagine what I'd do for $25 million.

296
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,070
You'll get your cut.

297
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,470
But you're gonna earn it.

298
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,340
And how much of that payday is
scofield and his crew earning?

299
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,360
Oh, I doubt they'll
be around to collect.

300
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,290
There's a lot of blood being
spilled and a lot of money

301
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,340
being offered up for just
a little old black book.

302
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,790
What's so funny?

303
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,220
That everyone thinks that scylla is
just the company's little black book.

304
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,620
how do i konw i can trust you?

305
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,020
king willow now

306
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,790
hey,buddy.

307
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,920
I understand from lincoln your mom had
a hamartoma in her right frontal lobe.

308
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,580
That's right.

309
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,370
When a tumor like that gets large enough to be
problematic,it's gonna come with a lot of symptoms.

310
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,220
Loss of short-term memory,problems with your
depth perception,problems with your motor skills.

311
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,040
If you had anything like
that,you'd let me know.

312
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,060
Yes,but I haven'T.And
I won'T.And I'm fine.

313
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,950
********

314
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,230
- Michael.
- yeah

315
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,910
The general is leaving.

316
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,250
The general is leaving.

317
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,410
All right,everybody get ready.

318
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,210
- You doing all right?
- Fine.Just not so good around blood is all.

319
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,760
I'll take care of the messy part,you
just help me get him on the gurney.

320
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,710
doesn't take two people
to crash a car,you know.

321
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,990
You're kidding me,right?After
all I've been through with you?

322
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,120
Now you're worried about my ass?

323
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,850
- Shut up and drive,okay?
- Buckle up.

324
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,490
what is it?

325
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,680
Linc,we got him.He's
two blocks away from you.

326
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,910
We're on it.

327
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,790
Here we go.

328
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,090
- what's he doing?
- Something's wrong.

329
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,840
He's turning around.

330
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,930
Linc,pull back!It's a trap.

331
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,940
Let's get out of here.

332
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,230
what the...

333
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,710
Sucre,get down!

334
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,940
Come on,linc!

335
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,360
- Faster!
- Keep your head down!Hang on!

336
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,500
You all right?

337
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,620
Damn,you're hit!

338
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,190
At subway stay with us,fernando.You're
going to be all right.

339
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,450
He came straight at us.We were set up.

340
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,900
So you're saying that they
knew we were going to be there?

341
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,310
Then they know about this place.

342
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,390
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- Brad,I'm gonna need some gauze.

343
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,050
Somebody could be coming here right now.

344
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,840
If they knew about this
place,we'd already be dead.

345
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,930
What about that gretchen chick?

346
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,220
She's got a couple of pages
from whistler's bird book.

347
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,310
It doesn't make her psychic.

348
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,100
Brad,I need some gauze.

349
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,890
**********

350
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,500
Well,it looks like someone set us up.

351
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,240
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

352
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,880
And I'm wondering if it was you.

353
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,160
Okay,first you give me the leper
treatment,and now I'm a traitor is that right?

354
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,800
Come on,roland,who else could've known
we were going at that intersection?

355
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,870
You know what,just because I didn't do
time with you guys,it doesn't make me a rat.

356
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,830
All right?I put just as much
into this job as anybody else.

357
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,280
Okay,I make one little mistake
and all of a sudden I'm judas?

358
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,680
No,you know what?You know,no.

359
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,940
Call self,okay,because...

360
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,630
because I'm gonna go back to the can.

361
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,070
- I'm done with this...
- all right.Just calm down.

362
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,790
Calm down.

363
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,410
I want you to look up all the local
businesses at the corner of king and willow.

364
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,780
I need the ones with
exterior security cameras,

365
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,960
'cause I'm looking for a
license plate number,all right?

366
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,720
How about an apology?

367
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,320
Where the hell is scofield?

368
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,680
We've been waiting for him
to break ground all day.

369
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,460
He's taking care of one last
thing.He'll be here in the morning.

370
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,450
And sara,what'd she
say about our meeting?

371
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,940
She's not interested.

372
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,470
Okay,well,if she changes
her mind,I'll be there.

373
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,980
Just so everyone knows,this is
sara's last chance to settle up.

374
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,330
I want all the grievances out on
the table so we can move forward.

375
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,730
Listen to me,skank.

376
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,820
You just got your stripes ripped
off your sleeve by your old boss.

377
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,110
So whatever clout you had
with the company,it's gone.

378
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,540
You work for me now.

379
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,590
So you can try to pull rank
on the hick here all you want,

380
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,090
but don't mistake my
patience for weakness.

381
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,930
You're alive right now for one
reason: Because I'm allowing you to be.

382
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,070
So when I get scylla,you'll
get your traveling money.

383
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,950
And when this is over,if you step one foot
on american soil,I'm gonna take this gun...

384
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,050
and I'm gonna put a bullet right there.

385
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,210
And that goes for you,too,gummo.

386
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,920
Are we clear?

387
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,430
We're clear.

388
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,340
Here.

389
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,740
I made this.

390
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,560
It's a chart of all the people
coming in and out of the office,

391
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,130
showing which times of the day are the
busiest and which are best for digging.

392
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,360
Just answer the phones.

393
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,040
I'll handle this.

394
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,750
- Did you get it?
- *****

395
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,120
Hurry up.

396
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,460
Why are we doing this again?

397
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,710
It's an insurance policy.

398
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,700
If she tries to get out
of that big scylla payday.

399
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,810
How big of a payday?

400
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,170
One million dollars.

401
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,640
You put a gun on me again,and these aren't
the only set of prints I'll be copying.

402
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,580
From this moment on,we are allies.

403
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,100
She watching?

404
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,590
Yes.

405
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,370
- Brace yourself.
- For what?

406
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:28,090
Don't you ever come in my office
again unless you're summoned!

407
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,970
Burrows was in the car.

408
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,640
It appears our source is dependable.

409
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,600
When I said bait the
hook,I did not mean with me.

410
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,540
They came that close to killing me.

411
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,330
I wouldn't let that happen.

412
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,640
But if you're unhappy with my methods,

413
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,250
maybe you should parcel
out the job to someone else.

414
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,410
I don't accept resignations.

415
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,110
Close the deal with the mystery man and bring the brothers
to me today or your severence pay will be a body bag.

416
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,080
Broad daylight,city street,and
they knew your route.

417
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,160
If scofield's mission was to kill
you,he'd have a better way to do it.

418
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,860
- Sara,you need anything?
- I'm good,michael.

419
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,060
I'm good.

420
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,660
Almost done,fernando.

421
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,040
*********

422
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,900
I would've died on this table
if it weren't for you,doc.

423
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,660
Just wait till you get my bill.

424
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,340
Hang in there,sucre.

425
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,020
Even if the warehouse ain't on the
company's radar,we sure as hell arE.

426
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,070
- This job's over.
- You don't know that.

427
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,470
I ain't going back to
fox river,I know that.

428
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,010
What do you think self is gonna do
when he finds out the company made us?

429
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,090
we're about to find out.

430
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,350
Yeah?

431
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,450
Hey,where the hell is
roland?His gps just went offline.

432
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,780
I'm here.

433
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,010
Well?

434
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,780
Took the corolla.

435
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,130
Take his laptop,too?

436
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,370
Yeah.

437
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,070
Alex.

438
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,310
You doing okay?

439
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,730
How much longer?

440
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,420
Almost.

441
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,360
Hey,you got this covered?

442
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,050
What are you still doing here?

443
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,850
Go get the son of a bitch.

444
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,470
All done.

445
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,370
you got my money?

446
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,530
Oh,yo,I thought this was going to be a legit business transaction,okay?

447
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,330
You don't got my money,I don't got the location of the brothers.

448
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,970
Where are they?

449
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,910
Oh,god!What are you doing?

450
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,390
Sara...

451
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,540
hi,sara.

452
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:36,740
A former mentor of mine once told me a story that I think applies to this situation.

453
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:42,530
At the end of the civil war,grant's union army had lee's confederate soldiers outflanked at appomattox.

454
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,180
Lee understood the futility of more bloodshed,so he requested a cease-fire.

455
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,260
He wanted to bring an end to the fighting.

456
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,530
Soldiers that had been killing each other that morning,

457
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:57,690
walked across the lines that afternoon for the first time as allies to trade northern coffee for southern tobacco.

458
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,880
Now,I don't expect us to exchange gifts,but that doesn't mean we can't be allies.

459
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,680
Of course,you can't have a cease-fire without both parties getting what they want.

460
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,630
You have five minutes.

461
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,520
Put as many scars on my back as possible.

462
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,920
I don't want to rush you,but you have four minutes left.

463
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,260
What was her name?

464
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,060
This is a one-time deal,sara.

465
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,020
You want your pound of flesh,you take it now.

466
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,620
What was her name?

467
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,330
Who?

468
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,690
The guard-- the one you shot and left to die in my arms.

469
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,380
That's what this is about?

470
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,700
A guard that couldn't do her job?

471
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,140
What was her name?

472
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,640
what was her name?

473
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,650
Taylor.

474
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,060
Her first name?

475
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,260
Michelle...

476
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,540
I think.

477
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,190
You should know that this isn't about me.

478
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,360
I can handle the scars you put on my back,but what you did to michelle...

479
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,330
I had orders.

480
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,470
She tried to help you escape.

481
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,360
She did help me escape.

482
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,120
She didn't try.

483
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,860
Sara...

484
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,880
you were too busy making an example out of her to find the key that she left with me.

485
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,160
Then she got what she deserved.

486
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,910
She saved my life.

487
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,790
And you took hers.

488
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,990
You proved your point.

489
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,390
We're even.

490
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,870
We're a long way from even.

491
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,480
And when this is over,you'll pay for michelle.

492
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,630
where are they?

493
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:50,150
the thing about a gunshot to the kneecap-- it takes days to die from it.

494
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,960
now,if I were to shoot you,let's say,here...

495
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,410
the hollow point would tumble through you leaving white-hot slivers in your insides,

496
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,980
causing unimaginable pain.

497
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,750
Only ending when you bled out on this pavement.

498
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,670
You don't want that,do you?

499
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,800
Then tell me where the brothers are.

500
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,150
They're in a warehouse.

501
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,010
Pier 31,san pedro-- they're all there.

502
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,980
Please...

503
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,600
thank you.

504
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,320
No!

505
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,320
What are you doing?

506
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,430
I told you what you wanted...

507
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,880
Enough.

508
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,830
You'll get your shot.

509
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,580
Now back off.

510
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,880
Alex,listen to him.

511
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,590
Hey,hey,you'll get your shot,man.

512
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,070
You'll get your shot.

513
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,020
Michael,come on.

514
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,780
He sold us out.

515
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,080
What are you doing?

516
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,580
We got to go.

517
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,390
Wait...

518
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,310
Michael,let's go.

519
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,530
Don't hand me any more updates.

520
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,080
They're surveilling me.

521
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,100
They're coming after me.

522
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,760
General,we'll get them.

523
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,460
This isn't the first time someone's made an attempt on your life.

524
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,920
This is not an attempt on my life.

525
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,450
This is an attempt on my card.

526
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,070
Get wyatt.

527
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,040
We're trying to contact him.

528
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,500
Don't try anything-- just get wyatt.

529
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,170
How do you want to proceed?

530
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,330
I want it moved.

531
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,260
To make the necessary arrangements for security would take days.

532
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,480
I don't care about logistics.

533
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,580
I want it moved.

534
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,930
Move scylla.

535
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,500
Now!

536
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,460
I'm sorry...

537
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,890
I'm sorry.

538
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm sorry.

539
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,050
I know.

540
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,360
I know.

541
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,590
I'm not ready to go,man.
