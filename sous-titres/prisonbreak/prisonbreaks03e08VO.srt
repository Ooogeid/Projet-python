1
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:10,820
We're losing the light! Go back!

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,019
You.

3
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:15,852
Is it your cell?

4
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:25,286
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.

5
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,852
And you're taking me with you.

6
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:28,119
So with this deal

7
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:31,319
what specifically are they expecting from me?

8
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:32,919
They need to know everything.

9
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:34,653
They want to confirm that you have viable,

10
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,586
incriminating information

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,353
and that you can be a cooperative witness.

12
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,586
Show me the pictures.

13
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:41,186
I can't show you the pictures, man.

14
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:43,985
She's dead, Michael.

15
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,720
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.

16
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:50,519
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.

17
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:52,286
I can still do it.

18
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,052
I'll let the brothers know.

19
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:24,814
Michael.

20
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,014
You like this?

21
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:30,014
Yeah.

22
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,547
It's a special occasion.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,580
My dad's coming today,

24
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,246
so I'm just gonna wait here till he shows up.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,047
You look sharp.

26
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,313
Thanks.

27
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,580
LJ. Is he...? Alive.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,914
Giving us four more days.

29
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,447
Okay, good.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,580
Listen, back at the exchange point,

31
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:00,347
I saw three body bags.

32
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,447
You, me and LJ,

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,081
we weren't getting out of there alive.

34
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:08,480
That's the last time I get caught flatfooted.

35
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:11,547
Then do what you got to do, Linc.

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,413
As long as I take care of my end, right?

37
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:18,747
Michael, I know you're angry with me about Sara, but...

38
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,180
You lied.

39
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:21,614
toI  lie.

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,246
Your son is my nephew,

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,880
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

42
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:35,246
But apparently...

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,880
apparently you only think I only care about myself.

44
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,714
I know you don't care about yourself,

45
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,047
but you cared about Sara.

46
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,313
You loved her.

47
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,047
And I'm sorry.

48
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,614
But LJ's my son.

49
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,447
I-I couldn't let anything happen to him.

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,614
You know that.

51
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:51,847
You used me, Linc.

52
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:56,914
So I guess you and the Company have something in common.

53
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:04,614
I don't know where he is.

54
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:06,780
I have tried every number I have.

55
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:15,047
Never mind.

56
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:17,213
I found him.

57
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,981
Carter Blue Label.

58
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:27,347
You always had such

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,580
high-end taste for a girl from Wheeling.

60
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,246
Since I paid for it...

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,847
You know how much I hate to travel, Gretchen...

62
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:43,081
...but considering the mess down here, I made an exception.

63
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:44,981
It was a mess before I got here.

64
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:46,714
And it's time to clean it up.

65
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:49,914
We're ending this today.

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,347
Bang and burn.

67
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,513
General, that was analyzed.

68
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:01,513
What you're asking for

69
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:03,547
is too dangerous, not to mention

70
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,347
next to impossible with the given time frame.

71
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,580
I remember

72
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:10,213
a substantial wire transfer to an offshore account

73
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:12,081
that took the word "impossible"

74
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:15,113
out of the equation-- or tell me,

75
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:18,447
did I hire the wrong person?

76
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:23,480
I am doing my job when I tell you to siously reconsider.

77
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,447
And now, I have to do my job.

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,081
I don't pay you to be my advisor.

79
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:34,113
You're my operative.

80
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:37,014
You have your instructions, now get it done.

81
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:39,213
Beuse if you don't,

82
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,513
I'll make what happened to you in Mosul

83
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,447
feel like a massage.

84
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:49,814
This was a big mistake, Gretchen.

85
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,547
You can't make a habit of coming to Sona.

86
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,847
I won't.

87
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,714
Because we're going with the bang anbud .

88
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:00,146
That's suicide.

89
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,081
We have more time.

90
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:05,747
My boss wants things to move a bit faster.

91
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,547
Well, tell him you can't pull it off.

92
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,513
I might get killed if we do this.

93
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:11,413
And I might get killed if we don't.

94
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:12,880
Between you and me,

95
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:15,014
who do you think I care about more?

96
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,580
Look at me, James.

97
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:19,747
See if you can tell how serious I am.

98
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
If you don't play ball,

99
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:24,180
I will leave you in Sona to rot.

100
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:26,413
I promise.

101
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,081
Be ready by 5:00.

102
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:29,413
That's when it hpens.

103
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,914
Everybody goes.

104
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:33,480
What about Scofield?

105
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:37,180
Kill him.

106
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,762
Hey.

107
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:38,560
You know the consequences if I'm seen talking to you?

108
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:41,660
The military's reinforcing the bars on all the windows.

109
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,693
Can you talk to the colonel,

110
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:45,593
get him to postpone that for a few days? .

111
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:46,693
After your performance yesterday,

112
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:48,460
I have no further sway with the colonel.

113
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:49,860
Well, then I'm afraid you've brokered your way

114
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:52,360
into an escape plan that no longer exists.

115
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:56,360
I have an idea.

116
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:57,660
Lechero...!

117
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,393
Wait to hear from me.

118
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,293
What?

119
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:11,126
Some of the men don't feel the need to pay their debts anymore.

120
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,693
It's been one week, man,

121
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:14,493
and we lost three men.

122
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:17,126
Now, if we gonna keep Sona, we're gonna need numbers.

123
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,493
I don't trust nobody here righnot  especially now.

124
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,994
I work with the men I have.

125
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:27,159
Really, brother?

126
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,393
You, me

127
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:31,226
and the gimp over there, we gonna run this place?

128
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,094
I want to bring on Cristobal.

129
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:36,793
He's solid, man.

130
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,060
One of them Darrien ghetto boys.

131
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,727
Bring him up.

132
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,593
But I promise you nothing.

133
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:55,426
Find me anything that can sustain heavy RPGs

134
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
and small arms.

135
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:57,960
A Cougar, a Stryker.

136
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,094
Not gonna happen.

137
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:00,827
I do have a call in to a Sergeant York, but...

138
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,493
Yeah, that's not going to cut it.

139
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:03,860
Call Suezamel, put him on standby,

140
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:06,193
tell him we might need him.

141
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:07,293
Is there a problem?

142
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:08,593
We're doing this at 5:00?

143
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:09,860
weWe could wait until tonight

144
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,094
when our guys are moving too fast

145
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:12,259
for our night vision to work properly.

146
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:13,893
You could even tag along if you want.

147
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,060
Get it done.

148
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:39,693
Hello.

149
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,560
Yes, I'm trying to locate the family of Mr. James Whistler.

150
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:46,326
I-I am his-- I'm his wife.

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,259
Who's calling?

152
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,460
My name is Tommy Day.

153
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,760
I own the apartment building Mr. Whistler rents from.

154
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:54,094
There's been a busted pipe in his unit that's caused

155
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,360
some damage to the apartment next door.

156
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,760
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:01,326
I think you have confused James with someone else.

158
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,326
He's not renting another apartment.

159
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,393
Oh, I assure you Mr. Whistler is my tenant.

160
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:09,060
I couldn't find anyone to contact after his conviction,

161
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:11,660
but when the mail came, I checked his phone bill.

162
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:14,226
There were numerous calls to this number.

163
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:15,827
If you could please come to the apartment,

164
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,627
the address is 40 Abel Bravo in Obarrio,

165
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,460
Unit 4.

166
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,526
Tell your men the intel says

167
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,193
the Panamanians have no access to SAM.

168
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:31,426
Yeah.

169
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,727
There's been a development.

170
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,293
Hey.

171
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,393
The Company's giving us four more days.

172
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,460
Okay. Problem is

173
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:02,060
I, uh, I don't know how we're getting out of here.

174
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:04,593
Lechero might have some ideas, but I'm still waiting

175
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:06,593
to hear from him.

176
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:09,426
I'm sorry, is this a bad time for you?

177
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,094
It's been an intense 24 hours.

178
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:13,627
I have things on my mind.

179
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,259
Yeah, like your last trip to visitation maybe.

180
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,660
What, you're a spy now?

181
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:22,060
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but she didn't really strike me

182
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:23,627
as the girlfriend type.

183
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,560
She was Company.

184
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:27,460
Afr your failed escape, she came to remind me

185
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,126
that I have a stake in this, too,

186
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,259
which you seem to have forgotten.

187
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:33,660
So forgive me if I don't jump for joy

188
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:35,493
when you say you're working on a plan

189
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:37,560
that may very well fail again.

190
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:40,526
I've got to get out of here,

191
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,027
and it's getting to the point where I don't care how.

192
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:51,526
Got what we talked about?

193
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,126
You never met me.

194
00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:17,094
Oh, my God.

195
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,393
What the hell is going on?

196
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,426
Shales...

197
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,159
What about Oscar Shales?

198
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:27,060
He... raped, killed, tortured.

199
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,493
I couldn't turn, turn him over

200
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:32,259
to some scumbag lawyer who was just gonna get him off or...

201
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:36,126
or... no, no, I just...

202
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,827
so I killed him.

203
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,627
And I felt... good.

204
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,360
I felt, I felt really good.

205
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:56,426
But then, you know, came the visions

206
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,526
of Shales begging for his life,

207
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,493
and I couldn't get rid of them,

208
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:04,827
so I, I got these drugs that kept me on an even keel.

209
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,760
And then when I got to Sona,

210
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,760
I coul get my pills, so I had to...

211
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:15,627
improvise.

212
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:22,860
Did you want me to get drugs for you?

213
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:26,259
I assume that whoever set this up must think

214
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:29,393
that I might have some value.

215
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:33,493
It's why you came back for me.

216
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:41,326
I came here to help a man that I respect and care about.

217
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,493
And I appreciate that.

218
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:50,159
But I can't testify like this.

219
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,693
Please...

220
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,593
One inch of reinforced steel on every window.se.

221
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,927
Nothing would get through those.

222
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,827
I'll figure something out.

223
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,293
I know you will.

224
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:19,760
Listen, man, I'm sorry about before.

225
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,727
Like I said, things have been intense.

226
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,893
So much depends on this working out.

227
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,126
My nephew's life depends on this working.

228
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,660
I know it does.

229
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:29,493
I never asked-- how old is he?

230
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:31,560
Sixteen.

231
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,860
Oh, hell.

232
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:36,393
Knock knocka.

233
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,793
What do you want?

234
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:41,259
Me? I just came by to slip something

235
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:42,426
into your mail slot.

236
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,027
It's from El Patron himself,

237
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,326
but it was made for your eyes only.

238
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,460
Grabby.

239
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,927
That don't look like no invitation

240
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,193
to the Sona-Hains Dance.

241
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,860
What do you got cooking up with Lechero, huh?

242
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,627
It's none of your business, Theodore.

243
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,060
You want to keep secrets?

244
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:59,593
You want to treat me like a pesky insect? Fine.

245
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:01,326
Just remember, information, like crumbs,

246
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,727
always trickles down to the vermin on the floor.

247
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:15,060
4:00?

248
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:19,126
It's a sketch of Lechero's quarters.

249
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:35,027
To be honest, when a tenant pays a year's rent in advance

250
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,293
and then gets locked up,

251
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:37,760
I normally rent the place out

252
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,094
and double my money, but, uh,

253
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,660
James was a good man.

254
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,860
I was hoping things would turn out well for him.

255
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:51,860
Look, uh, miss...

256
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:53,960
a lot of guys have a little something on the side.

257
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,094
This apartment, I mean, whoever he brought here,

258
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,293
doesn't mean he didn't love ya.

259
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:05,193
You said you have James' insurance paper?

260
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,426
Right on. Right on.

261
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,259
I'll, uh, I'll go get them.

262
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,027
Oh, God.

263
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,027
There's another door in here.

264
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,893
"4413."

265
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:21,226
4413, huh?

266
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,060
Michael grunts)

267
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,460
What about Scofield?

268
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,493
Kill him.

269
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,493
You know, if Lechero didn't send this,

270
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:39,493
T-Bag might be setting me up for someone.

271
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:41,560
I say we get out of here.

272
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:44,060
I'm truly rrsoyou got caught up in my troubles, Michael.

273
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:01,981
I take it there's another code.

274
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:03,615
I'm the only one that knows it.

275
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:04,649
For a man who likes keeping a secret,

276
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:06,048
choosing T-Bag as a go-bween

277
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,615
might not be the smartest move.

278
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:10,315
Yeah, by the time he figures it out, we'll be long gone.

279
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:13,315
Sammy's on his way back. Let's go.

280
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,348
What the hell's this?

281
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,248
Underground tunnel.

282
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:39,415
The old administration used it

283
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:42,148
to travel between cellblocks A and B.

284
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:46,649
After the riots, they moved us all to B.

285
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:49,881
And then the soldiers came in,

286
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:51,649
blew this tunnel up.

287
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,415
Looks like someone already tried to get through the debris.

288
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:07,215
I never planned to spend my whole life in Sona.

289
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:10,081
Just didn't expect it to end so soon.

290
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,548
You're the engineer, though, right?

291
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:14,382
You can dig our way out of this?

292
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:17,515
Yeah, me and a couple of payloaders.

293
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:18,948
Now, you listen.

294
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,682
You're gonna dig out of this place.

295
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:25,881
We're not digging out, but we might be diggin up.

296
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,248
Hello, Sofia.

297
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,282
Hello. Who are you?

298
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,048
Friend of James.

299
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,382
Old friend.

300
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:49,582
Well, he isn't here.

301
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:52,548
I know where he is.

302
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:58,582
I can see why James loves you.

303
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,615
You arebeautiful.

304
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,649
If you keep sticking your nose where

305
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:04,981
it doesn't belong,

306
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,715
I'm gonna make him miss you very, very much.

307
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,848
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

308
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,781
Good.

309
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,682
You don't need to worry about this.

310
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:21,348
Now listen very carefully to me, Sofia, and you won't get hurt.

311
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:23,749
I want you to go home ando your hair

312
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:25,649
and paint your nails and get all ready

313
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:27,781
for when James comes home.

314
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:29,448
You two will live happily ever after.

315
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,015
What do you want from him?

316
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,814
See? You're not listening already.

317
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:37,115
Don't get in the way,

318
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:40,282
or I promise you things will get very bad for you.

319
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,382
You are truly beautiful.

320
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:54,115
I hope you can stay that way.

321
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:57,448
Get the hell out of rehe

322
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:12,515
All right, if we can get through

323
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:15,048
the ceiling, the foundation and the earth on top othat,

324
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,482
we can make it out into the middle of no-man's-land

325
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,682
and maybe hit the fence before we get shot.

326
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:22,115
Yeah. Well, we wouldn't want that.

327
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,548
Yes, but you can dig out, though, right?

328
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:27,282
Based on gravity and the kind of sand that Sona's built on,

329
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:30,015
we're gonna need some kind of support brace for the tunnel.

330
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,382
Or...

331
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:32,448
Or what?

332
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,482
The whole thing collapses and we're buried alive.

333
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:42,749
Go on and relax, huh?

334
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,181
I'll get some rum.

335
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,615
ngHo will this take?

336
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,649
Maybe two days.

337
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,482
I got to get upstairs, estimate exactly where

338
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,548
in no-man's land that tunnel's gonna let out.

339
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:04,248
Where you going? I'm meditating.

340
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:06,582
Just getng rum for Cristobal and his boys.

341
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:08,348
Rum?! His boys?!

342
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:10,715
No, I said I'd meet with Cristobal,

343
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,181
not every half-breed in Sona.

344
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,682
Well, they up there right now.

345
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:14,848
So, let's go.

346
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,948
Let me just get some rum, now. No, man.

347
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,749
Them drink beer like everyone else.

348
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,881
Look, man, offer them something good.

349
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,948
Don't make me lookhe fool.

350
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,048
The rum is for me, Sammy.

351
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:27,715
No?

352
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:29,215
You have a problem with that?

353
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:34,315
No, sir.

354
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:38,682
Let's go.

355
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:44,148
Let's get back to work.

356
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:51,781
Hey, only Lechero has the code.

357
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:54,015
We don't need a code.

358
00:21:58,448 --> 00:21:59,781
Now, get inside

359
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:01,215
before Sammy comes back.

360
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,615
Alex?

361
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:17,749
Where's Agent Lang?

362
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:19,149
Agent... I don't know.

363
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:21,649
But what the hell's wrong with you? What's going on?

364
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:24,215
I have a right to be nervous.

365
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:25,782
My life is on the line, you know?

366
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:27,183
What are you talking about?

367
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:30,615
You have given live press conferences your entire life.

368
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,083
I've see you many times. You're an old pro.

369
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:34,515
Now, splash some water on your face.

370
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:36,682
The panel wants us there right now, immediately.

371
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:38,482
What? Get dressed.

372
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,849
Or would you rather have me

373
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:41,183
drag your ass back to Sona?

374
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:44,649
Water on the face. Get your suit on. We're going.

375
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,649
Yeah, it's Sullins.

376
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,682
Uh, we're almost ready to move here.

377
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:53,248
Where the hell is Lang?

378
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,315
No.

379
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:57,016
Where are we at?

380
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,482
Everything's in place.

381
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,449
Good. We've done our part.

382
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:03,682
Now it's time for Whistler to step up and do his.

383
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:07,348
Come 5:00, he tter be ready.

384
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:09,382
Three feet of concrete and rebar,

385
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,582
plus ten feet of dirt and sand,

386
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:13,149
before we see sky.

387
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:18,183
Are you all right?

388
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:21,716
To be completely honest...

389
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:23,282
no,

390
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:24,382
not really.

391
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:26,982
I have this thing for, uh, confined spaces.

392
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:28,549
Are you telling me you're claustrophobic?

393
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:29,749
Ever since I was a...

394
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:31,083
boy.

395
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,116
Um, you know, I need to be upstairs.

396
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:34,849
That's not really an option right now.

397
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:37,649
Well, staying here is not really an option for me, either.

398
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,382
I suggest you get yourself togetr.

399
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:41,549
I just need some air.

400
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,849
What the hell's the matter with you?

401
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,782
I need to get out of here; I need air. Hey, you walk

402
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:51,749
through that door with Sammy on the other side,

403
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:51,749
you'll never need air again.

404
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:55,315
You don't understand-- I need to get out of here now.

405
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:58,049
Why don't you tell me wh really going on here, Whistler?

406
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,882
Why do you keep looking at your watch?

407
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,482
What are you really up to?

408
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:05,083
Scofield, the men are gone-- let's move.

409
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,816
I need your cell phone.

410
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:14,549
No, Sammy's on his way-- get out of here.

411
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:17,415
I have to call my brother. No, cell phone stays with me. Now,

412
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:17,415
get out of here!

413
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,682
Well, just so that we're clear, Americano,

414
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:25,382
she's got no electricity and no running water.

415
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:28,515
Septic's out, too, but there's an outhouse in the woods.

416
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,482
It's perfect. A hundred bucks a month. $200.

417
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:33,782
A hundred bucks a month.

418
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:36,582
Deal.

419
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:39,215
But I don't want growing no drugs on the land.

420
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:40,549
No marijuana.

421
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,049
You got that?

422
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,049
Welcome home, my friend. Thanks.

423
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,749
Listen, man, if you want

424
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:59,482
to get out of here, I'd get it and Michael would, too.

425
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:02,049
You've done more than enough. If I had a kid

426
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,083
in the same situation as your son,

427
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,282
would you and your brother walk out on me?

428
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:07,449
Yeah.

429
00:25:07,482 --> 00:25:09,882
Here, this is good.

430
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,449
Put it down there.

431
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,816
Okay, hold on.

432
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,515
You ready?

433
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:19,482
Yeah.

434
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:26,149
I hope this works, papi.

435
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,116
All right, let's go.

436
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:34,449
McGrady.

437
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:39,649
I need your help.

438
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:42,016
Not now, bro-- my father finally got here; I'm gonna go see him.

439
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:44,882
Actually, uh, I need his help, too.

440
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,382
What you want from my old man?

441
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,049
I just need someone to deliver

442
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,482
a message on the outside, someone I can trust.

443
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:53,348
Hell, no. My papa's straight as razor blade.

444
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:56,248
He don't get into kind of trouble like you do.

445
00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:59,882
It's not trouble-- it's just a phone call. No.

446
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,315
I love my father.

447
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:03,016
And I love my brother-- and if he doesn't

448
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,916
get this message, something horrible's gonna happen to him.

449
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,849
Something really bad is going on.

450
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,215
Please.

451
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:16,816
Hello, son.

452
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,782
Papa.

453
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:21,382
You look very handsome.

454
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,682
Like your school picture.

455
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,716
Gracias.

456
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,649
I cleaned a guy's cell for this shirt.

457
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:30,415
You should be in school now...

458
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:32,515
It's okay, Papa. with your friends.

459
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:36,949
Papa, please, don't get upset.

460
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:39,348
I-I have friends in here.

461
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:41,049
The American?

462
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,348
Yes. He's nice.

463
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:46,449
He keeps his word-- it's very rare in Sona.

464
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,116
And, uh...

465
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,049
he needs my help.

466
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:54,215
Thank God you're here.

467
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:56,149
Thought you might have come a little earlier,

468
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,716
just to make sure I was okay.

469
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,916
I read the newspaper; I knew you were safe.

470
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:05,083
I am for now-- but you might not be.

471
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:07,083
Now, listen to me carefully.

472
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:10,582
Promise me you won't go anywhere near Lincoln Burrows today.

473
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:11,916
Lincoln? It's just too dangerous

474
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:14,582
to be around him, to be with him, to be near him.

475
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:17,749
Just go home and stay there,

476
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:20,116
and I will call you tonight.

477
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:22,083
That's all I can say.

478
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:23,882
Do you understand?

479
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:26,949
Call me? From where? Do you understand me?

480
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:28,415
Yeah.

481
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:29,782
Promise me.

482
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,149
Say it out loud.

483
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,382
I promise.

484
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:36,248
Why are you so scared?

485
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:39,582
Because I can't have you get hurt.

486
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:45,782
Because I love you... more than anything in the world.

487
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,215
Do you?

488
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,782
Yeah.

489
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:53,982
James,

490
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,315
I got a ca today

491
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:57,549
from a man who said he's your landlord.

492
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,415
Talking about another apartment.

493
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:03,816
Should I call him back?

494
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,348
Must have been a wrong number.

495
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:07,849
He asked for you by name.

496
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:09,282
The man is clearly confused.

497
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,348
I don't know anything about another apartment.

498
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:13,248
Sofia,

499
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:16,549
all I know is that you've got to stay away from Lincoln.

500
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:18,982
Please.

501
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,816
Okay, James.

502
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:24,415
I'll wait for your call.

503
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:31,248
Here.

504
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:34,049
I have this.

505
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,149
I don't want to see it.

506
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,849
I'll... put it with the others.

507
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:41,649
I'm not coming home.

508
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:43,449
Accept that.

509
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:49,116
You should go.

510
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:54,482
Make that call for my friend.

511
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,649
Happy birthday, son.

512
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,749
Maybe we should pick up some locks

513
00:29:14,782 --> 00:29:17,315
and secure the house. It can't have anything new on it.

514
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:19,716
The place needs to look abandoned.

515
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:22,348
Yeah?

516
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:24,282
I have a message for you.

517
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:26,083
Don't come home for dinner.

518
00:29:26,116 --> 00:29:27,149
Who is this?

519
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,582
I'm supposed to tell you,

520
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:31,083
don't come home for dinner.

521
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:32,215
What?

522
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,549
When me and Mikey were kids,

523
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:36,248
we had a code when Social Services

524
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:39,016
were trying to get me into juvie.

525
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:41,183
He's telling me to watch my back.

526
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,348
What the hell are you doing here?

527
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:49,215
Why haven't you returned my calls or my car?

528
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:50,482
You have him?

529
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:53,248
Yeah, he just arrived back at his hotel.

530
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:54,949
But Whistler's girl tracked him down.

531
00:29:54,982 --> 00:29:56,116
And she's talking

532
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:58,849
to Lincoln and the Mexican.

533
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,248
After what she saw today, she could be complicating things.

534
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:02,348
You have a directive?

535
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:04,282
I warned her.

536
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:05,449
Take them all out.

537
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:06,849
What will Whistler say?

538
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,342
I don't care about your boyfriend's apartment

539
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,576
on the side, I just don't care.

540
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:18,242
No, I went there.

541
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,676
And a woman showed up;

542
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,741
she threatened me.

543
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,442
She knows James.

544
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:25,008
Susan.

545
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:25,975
You know her?

546
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:27,942
She's the one who has LJ.

547
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:31,975
Well, she took something I found,

548
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:33,209
a passport.

549
00:30:33,242 --> 00:30:34,741
It had James' picture and birthday

550
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:37,642
but his name said Gary Miller.

551
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:38,808
Lincoln, I don't know what's going on.

552
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:40,008
I'll tell you what's going on--

553
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,108
your boyfriend's a liar.

554
00:30:41,142 --> 00:30:42,142
I told you that from the start.

555
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,609
James told me to stay away from you today,

556
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,008
that it was dangerous.

557
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:48,442
Let's go.

558
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,309
Pronto.

559
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:04,008
I need to speak to Michael Scofield.

560
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:05,008
I'm his brother.

561
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,509
How you get this number?

562
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:11,509
He called  a few days back.

563
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:12,676
I-I didn't answer.

564
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:15,108
But, listen, I-I need to speak to him now.

565
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,808
Let's go.

566
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:30,642
You'll never guess Michael Scofield's brother.

567
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:32,509
Who calls me...

568
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,642
and who I call,

569
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:36,008
is my business.

570
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,209
Where are your friends?

571
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:43,942
I don't know.

572
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:45,442
Where are your f?ri

573
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:47,841
I don't know, Please don't shoot. Please.

574
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:49,975
Drop it.

575
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:13,242
Different day, same problem, huh, Lincoln?

576
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:15,908
You know how it turned out when LJ was in this position,

577
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:19,242
y is no different...

578
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:22,309
so be a good boy and put down the gun.

579
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,908
Come on, Linc.

580
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:27,741
I know you've learned your lesson.

581
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,875
You're right, I have.

582
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,242
For the record,

583
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:55,375
this is an international hearing,

584
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:56,542
requested by the United States government,

585
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:01,242
for the purpose of hearing testimony from one

586
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:03,042
Mr. Alexander Mahone.

587
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:05,775
You gotta be kidding me.

588
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:07,442
So, Mr. Mahone,

589
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,942
when were you first contacted by anyone

590
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:14,075
from the group referred to the Company?

591
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:15,509
They told me...

592
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:20,142
that if I didn't kill every one of the Fox River Eight,

593
00:33:20,175 --> 00:33:22,375
that they would come after me.

594
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:24,042
They had all worked with-with Scofield

595
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:25,609
on-on-on the escape,

596
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:28,075
so the Company wasn't sure what they knew.

597
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:30,642
Mr. Mahone, I'm going to ask you

598
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,375
to please keep your answer related to the question.

599
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:34,841
It's-it's all connected.

600
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,708
It's just... it's-it's a web.

601
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,841
And-and it's a web that I got caught in.

602
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,841
And-and Lincoln Burrows got caught in,

603
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:44,142
and Michael Scofield got caught in.

604
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:45,209
I, if I may,

605
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:46,642
I think what Mr. Mahone...

606
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:48,242
We're all just like flies... was trying to say...

607
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:49,209
Thank you, Mr. Sullins,

608
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,309
but we're here to hear from Mr. Mahone.

609
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:52,808
Now, we're going to try this again.

610
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:55,409
When were you first contacted

611
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:57,509
by the Company?

612
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,242
I cannot say.

613
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,509
You know...

614
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,576
they could be in contact with you or-or-or...

615
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,275
you could be in contact with them, you'd never know.

616
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:12,775
It's-it's... they could be in contact with us right now.

617
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:14,142
I know...

618
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:15,676
it sounds crazy, right?

619
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,375
It's craz... and...

620
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,942
and it would be, except for the simple fact that...

621
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,841
it's true.

622
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,042
The government that I had dedicated my life to

623
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,908
manipulate and extorted me.

624
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,708
Blackmailed me.

625
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:31,908
So that I would kill for them.

626
00:34:31,942 --> 00:34:36,042
And I did the things that they made me do

627
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:39,042
so I could protect my family.

628
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:42,875
And so...

629
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,542
I would like to go home.

630
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:55,375
So can Ithat, please?

631
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,741
Hey.

632
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,142
Where have you been?

633
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:05,442
I came looking

634
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:07,841
for scrap metal for the support brace for the tunnel.

635
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,309
Really?

636
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,509
Looks like a pretty tight squeeze up there.

637
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,708
You sure there's enough fresh air,

638
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:16,275
or does the claustrophobia come and go?

639
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:20,042
What's it like going through life always distrustful?

640
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,108
You tell me, James.

641
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:23,908
Hate to break up the brouhaha, gentlemen,

642
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:26,108
but Lechero would like to see you.

643
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:28,371
Says it has something to do with your big brotr.

644
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:44,553
Give us a moment, will you, Teodoro?

645
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,452
If your brother should ever call my cell phone again,

646
00:35:58,486 --> 00:36:02,920
you tell him you're the one that's gonna pay.

647
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:17,086
Yeah?

648
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,153
You got the message. Yeah, you were right.

649
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:20,553
They just tried to take us out.

650
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:21,820
I know.

651
00:36:21,853 --> 00:36:23,586
Whistler got a visit from the Company.

652
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,020
He's been acting strange ever since.

653
00:36:25,053 --> 00:36:26,586
I'm telling you, Linc, something's up.

654
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,120
Doing more than acting strange, man.

655
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:29,287
He just told Sofia not to be

656
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,953
near me 'cause it's dangerous.

657
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:34,086
The Company's coming after us.

658
00:36:36,287 --> 00:36:37,786
They don't need us anymore.

659
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,486
Here we go.

660
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,953
They're breaking him out on their own.

661
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:52,920
We're 100 yards from the target.

662
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:55,619
Keep your eyes open. Let's get in and out fast.

663
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,653
Come on!

664
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,493
Damn!

665
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:22,327
man shouting)

666
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,227
Come on!

667
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,860
Come on! Keep it coming!

668
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:28,860
Come on! Hey!

669
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:36,728
I've got a helicopter and two inmates.

670
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:39,661
I can't make out their faces, but they're on the roof!

671
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,960
Come on!

672
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:30,060
Can't get a clean shot!

673
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:32,294
I'll get lower, take 'em out!

674
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:37,227
Is that Scofield on the roof with Whistler?

675
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,728
Is that really a question?

676
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:42,694
He's supposed to be dead.

677
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,927
Man down. Man down.

678
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,993
Let go! I'm slipping.

679
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:05,494
We lost Whistler. Abort. Abort.

680
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:06,728
Mission failure.

681
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,494
Return to Base One immediately.

682
00:40:40,748 --> 00:40:43,081
Alex...

683
00:40:43,114 --> 00:40:45,715
I'm so sorry.

684
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:49,615
I'm going to have to take you back to Sona.

685
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:27,748
You, get up.

686
00:41:27,782 --> 00:41:29,515
Vamos!

687
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:38,048
Mr. Scofield,

688
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:44,014
there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.

689
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:45,348
Somehow I don't think it's a coincidence

690
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:49,048
that you arrived shortly before they happened.

691
00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:51,248
I d hathing to do with that.

692
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:58,981
You've caused too many problems here in Sona,

693
00:41:59,014 --> 00:42:02,715
so maybe you shouldn't be here in Sona.

694
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:08,482
Say good-bye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.

695
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:10,515
Vamos.
