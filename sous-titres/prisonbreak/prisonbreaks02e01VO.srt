1
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:03,822
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

2
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:05,703
If you didn't kill Terrence Steadman,

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:08,201
how the hell did someone
make it look like you did?

4
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,629
I'm getting you out of here.

5
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:10,688
That's impossible.

6
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,466
Not if you designed the place,
it isn't.

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,837
Better be open, bro.

8
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:37,905
- You're asking me to break the law.
- I'm asking you to make a mistake:

9
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:39,359
forget to lock up.

10
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:41,888
We're in.

11
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:50,185
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

12
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:51,733
Nobody.

13
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,178
Terrence Steadman's still alive.

14
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,302
Hello, Terrence.

15
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:55,954
Sound the alarm!

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,674
- What's going on?
- No! No!

17
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,065
- What do we do now?
- We run!

18
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,290
The escapees, who were they?

19
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,083
Got a list right here.

20
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:38,322
Read it to me, if you could.

21
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:41,031
Michael Scofield, structural engineer,

22
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:43,349
five years for armed robbery.

23
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:45,650
Benjamin Miles Franklin,

24
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:47,952
former U.S. Army,

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,190
8 years for possession of stolen goods.

26
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:52,748
John Abruzzi,

27
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,715
don of the crime family
of the same name.

28
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:00,831
Life without parole
for conspiracy to commit murder.

29
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:03,879
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik,

30
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,674
60 years for second-degree murder.

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,327
Fernando Sucre,

32
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:14,273
five years for aggravated robbery.

33
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,396
David "Tweener" Apolskis,

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,857
5 years for grand larceny.

35
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,581
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell,

36
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:28,604
life for six counts of

37
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:31,172
kidnapping, rape
and first-degree murder.

38
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,457
And Lincoln Burrows,

39
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,686
scheduled to die next week

40
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,028
for the murder
of President Reynold's brother.

41
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,765
How long has it been
since they got over the wall?

42
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:50,012
8:00 last night.

43
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,561
Scofield, he and Burrows were brothers.

44
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,241
That's right.

45
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,616
And he's the mastermind
of this whole thing.

46
00:02:58,097 --> 00:02:59,796
That's what they're saying.

47
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,252
I want everything they've got on him.

48
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:16,881
Right there !

49
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:34,747
Keep moving, let's go.

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,385
Where are they?

51
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,699
What the hell is that?

52
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:51,645
Let's go.

53
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:58,178
All we got to do is make it
to the other side.

54
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,160
- What ?
- Make it to the other side.

55
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,193
Come on, guys! C'mon,

56
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:06,496
Run !

57
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,131
C'mon, pick it up!

58
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:12,641
We gotta go, run !

59
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:14,350
Let's go, move it, move it!

60
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:18,400
No! The thing is gaining speed, man!

61
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:23,810
- It's going too fast!
- Go through!

62
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,774
- What?!
- Go through!

63
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:31,362
Drag it!

64
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,118
Hold the fire!

65
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:43,611
Freeze!

66
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,991
I will gun you down, Scofield!

67
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,478
Michael, hold on!

68
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,043
- Where's the aerial unit?
- They're back on the ground refueling.

69
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:11,574
Son of a bitch.

Subtitle made by www.sub-way.fr
Version 1.00

71
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:47,217
Sir,

72
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,177
media's ready.

73
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,846
I'd like to...

74
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,810
talk about John Wilkes Booth
for a moment if I could,

75
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,251
Abraham Lincoln's killer.

76
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:27,880
12 days,

77
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:30,487
that's how long it took to find him.

78
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,785
In his journal during this period,
he wrote that

79
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:34,405
the shadow was his friend,

80
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,129
the night his domain.

81
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,157
He acknowledged that
whatever neuroses drove the criminal

82
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,763
to commit the original crime

83
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,353
is compounded,

84
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:44,822
magnified

85
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,219
by flight,

86
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,461
by the sounds of dogs at his heels.

87
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:51,954
Fear becomes paranoia,

88
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,859
paranoia ultimately psychosis.

89
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:58,598
I bring this up, because,

90
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,495
in 140 years,

91
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,219
the fundamental mind of the escaped man

92
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:04,692
has not changed.

93
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,934
The escaped man is still human.

94
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,167
He is still afraid,

95
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:12,407
and he will stop at nothing
in his attempt at flight.

96
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:15,582
Fortunately for us,

97
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,187
while our...

98
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,603
quarry has...

99
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,095
"shadow and night" as his ally,

100
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,749
we have something far greater:

101
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,101
television.

102
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:30,519
I would encourage everyone
who is watching,

103
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:32,927
everyone in this country,

104
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,739
to take a good look at these faces.

105
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:36,872
These men right here

106
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,374
are now the 8 most-wanted men
in America.

107
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,762
I thought I'd thought this out.
I thought...

108
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,448
You saw all those guys back there?

109
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:52,073
The key is they're back there,

110
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,461
and we're up here.

111
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,265
Yeah, and how long
is that going to last?

112
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,058
Especially since we don't have
a pot to piss in thanks to Abruzzi's

113
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,564
magically disappearing jet.

114
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:01,552
You were never gonna be
on that plane, brother.

115
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,236
And don't think I don't know
where you're going either, Scofield.

116
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,978
- Where am I going?
- Oh, I don't know.

117
00:08:05,993 --> 00:08:07,249
Utah?

118
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,240
When were you planning on
telling us about the money, man?

119
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,381
What money?

120
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:16,527
$5 million that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

121
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:20,265
You don't know
what you're talking about.

122
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:21,918
You wish I didn't know.

123
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,778
Wait, wait. What money?

124
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,159
Warden?

125
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,427
It's a little early for the FBI
to be showing up, don't you think?

126
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:33,985
Look, I get it.

127
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:35,922
It's still your investigation,
but once those

128
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:38,318
criminals cross state lines
it'll become a federal matter.

129
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,942
Yeah, well, that is not going to happen.

130
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:41,272
I hope you're right.

131
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,500
That's why I was going
to suggest that we cut through

132
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:45,444
any interagency politics
from the outset.

133
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,973
Full transparency.

134
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,228
Absolutely.

135
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:49,607
Good.

136
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:52,618
Then maybe you can
tell me about Dr. Tancredi.

137
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,129
There's nothing to tell.

138
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,509
From what I'm hearing,
she may have abetted the escapees,

139
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,333
opened the door
that allowed them to get out.

140
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,839
Like I said, there's nothing to tell.

141
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,794
You're not being
very transparent, Warden.

142
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,819
Look, I don't discuss my staff.

143
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,395
Maybe you should,

144
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,623
because she may be
the key to this thing.

145
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,843
We need to speak with her.

146
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,044
Right now, Mr. Mahone,

147
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,499
she's not going
to be speaking with anyone.

148
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:29,878
How are we doing?

149
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,807
Well, the IVs are hydrating her.

150
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:35,410
We got her on a naloxone
infusion, half milligram per hour.

151
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:38,006
What do you think the chances are?

152
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:41,539
Well, we've done everything
on our end, and it's really up to her.

153
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:44,076
Either she fights and lives, or she...

154
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,284
quits and dies.

155
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,511
What do you think...

156
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:46,144
Do whatever thing you got to do, man.

157
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,673
Oh, and...

158
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:54,543
boy...

159
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,913
you call the cops,
I will put this thing right here...

160
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,050
...in your eye.

161
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,085
Thank you.

162
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:27,780
A Structural engineer?

163
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:30,673
Not the kind you'd expect
to get that much ink.

164
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,178
Not the kind at all.

165
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:36,293
How long do you think it'd take
to get something like that done?

166
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,550
Hundred hours... 200.

167
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,651
Tattoo artist who gave it to him

168
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:42,383
must have spent
a lot of time on him then.

169
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:45,462
I'll find out who it was.

170
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:51,030
- Mr. Bellick.
- Don't talk to me.

171
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,621
Fine, but it's going
to make collaboration kind of hard.

172
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:54,915
Collaboration?

173
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,803
I got men out here in harm's way,

174
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,540
and you're giving press conferences.

175
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,371
The press is a tool.

176
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,841
It'll bring those men back quicker
than bloodhounds will.

177
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,313
We don't need you.

178
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,592
We're hot on these guys' trail,

179
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,587
and it's just a matter of time
till we nail them.

180
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,888
The problem I find with
"being on a trail"

181
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,371
is that by definition,

182
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,146
you'll always be behind your prey.

183
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:17,233
We'll see about that.

184
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,435
I'm not armed.

185
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:27,458
You'll have to excuse me

186
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,378
if I'm a little short on trust
at the moment.

187
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:31,210
I assure you, young woman,

188
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:33,315
I'm the furthest thing from a threat.

189
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,169
I think the Percocet
pretty much ensures that.

190
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:38,538
Good, then you won't mind if I...

191
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,881
capture this moment for posterity.

192
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:42,839
Won't do you any good.

193
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,290
You don't care
that someone's going to be executed

194
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,173
for your murder
while you're just sitting here.

195
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:49,838
I'm not the one who choose
Lincoln Burrows as the fall guy.

196
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:51,274
Who did?

197
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:53,052
Your sister, the President?

198
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,525
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner to all of this.

199
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,571
Oh, come on.

200
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,139
You could have come forward.

201
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,736
You could have stopped this thing
before it even got started.

202
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,096
No, I really am a prisoner.

203
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:04,918
And now, you are, too.

204
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,690
The moment
you let that door shut behind you.

205
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:19,194
Didn't it strike you as curious

206
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:22,045
that there wasn't
any security out there?

207
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,264
The doors only open from the outside.

208
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,388
The glass is two inches thick,

209
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:27,720
bulletproof.

210
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:32,827
There's no getting out of here,
young woman.

211
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,168
We got to dump them now.

212
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:40,933
Can't.

213
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:42,727
They know about Utah.

214
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,625
All the more reason to dump them.

215
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:47,287
If they get caught, the feds will know
exactly where we're going.

216
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:48,552
They'll tell them.

217
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:50,341
We just got to make sure
they stay afloat

218
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:52,064
until we're off in Utah,

219
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,170
doing what we got to do.

220
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,097
You really think
the money's going to be there?

221
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:02,724
Charles might have had
a flexible relationship with the truth,

222
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,272
but at the end...

223
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:07,056
at the end, there'd be no reason
for him to lie about it.

224
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:10,494
I figure once we bag it,
we cross over into Mexico,

225
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:13,271
take a whole bunch
of bumpy second-class bus rides

226
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,402
till we hit Panama.

227
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:17,650
You really got a fix
on this dive shop thing, huh?

228
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:18,754
Yeah.

229
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,410
Right now,
I wouldn't mind swinging in a hammock

230
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,691
for the next ten or 20 years.

231
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,750
We got half the country after us.
We ain't making it

232
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:29,242
to Panama or Utah. Not without help.

233
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,030
Veronica can't help us.

234
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:34,654
How can you say that?

235
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,364
- We don't have money, clothes...
- I already got all that.

236
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:40,418
I thought the plan was Abruzzi's jet.

237
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,396
Abruzzi's jet was Plan A.

238
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,512
- Then we got...
- Everything we need.

239
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:46,692
Where?

240
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:49,516
Storage.

241
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:01,580
Scofield designed the tattoo, not you?

242
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,224
He brought the entire thing in,
every element.

243
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,114
I mean, look at it;
it's the freakin' Sixtine Chapel.

244
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,275
I knew the guy was an engineer
or whatever, but man,

245
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,883
his skill as an artist was unbelievable.

246
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:14,629
What else? What can you tell me
about him as a person?

247
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:17,309
He was cool, you know.

248
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:19,056
But talk about a detail nazi.

249
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:20,870
Everything had to be perfect,

250
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:22,739
exactly as he drew it.

251
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:25,940
I always sort of had the feeling
that the whole thing was some sort of

252
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,413
inside joke that only he was in on.

253
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,941
We have your number, right?

254
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:36,026
Yeah.

255
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:39,122
I may be calling you. Thank you.

256
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:43,253
Foley!

257
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:48,837
What was the name of that long road
we took to get to the prison?

258
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:50,573
I think it was English street.

259
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:57,594
And out in front of the prison,
the two streets that intersect with it?

260
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,575
Fitz and Percy. Why?

261
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:00,719
Thank you.

262
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:05,393
Saddle up.

263
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,319
- Where we going?
- Somewhere

264
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,034
we can stop being cons
and start being civilians.

265
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,456
You know, why don't you cut out
all the riddles, Snowflake,

266
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,363
and just give it to us straight?

267
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:15,718
What?

268
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:19,895
Hi.

269
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,359
Hi.

270
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,017
Little one.

271
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:27,645
What are you doing?

272
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:29,307
Well, uh...

273
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,409
We're just fishing.

274
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,301
With no poles?

275
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,058
Well, we like to fish with our hands.

276
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,806
Yes, eh... hand-fishing.

277
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,119
I think the question is,

278
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:47,593
what are you doing out here?

279
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,596
- Hunting.
- Gracie...

280
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,824
Get away, Gracie.

281
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,240
Get away. Get back.

282
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,185
You're those guys from Fox River.

283
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,716
Don't any of you move a freakin' muscle.

284
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,203
Get away from her.

285
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,369
Get away from her!

286
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,051
Okay, okay, just...

287
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:12,116
relax.

288
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:16,067
Sir...

289
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:17,408
Stay where you are.

290
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:19,854
Put your gun down !

291
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,365
- Let her go...
- Right Now !

292
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,601
Let her go !

293
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:24,102
John, let go of the girl.

294
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,725
- Shut up!
- Let her go!

295
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:28,133
Put it down. Drop the gun!

296
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,513
You drop the gun.

297
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,260
Drop it now.

298
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,161
You put the gun down.

299
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:36,414
One.

300
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,208
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

301
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,876
Two!

302
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,520
Good boy.

303
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,224
Get the gun.

304
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:51,225
Pick it up!

305
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,275
Don't you hurt her, don't you...

306
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,108
You're going to be all right.

307
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,696
Run to Daddy.

308
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,238
I ain't going to say anything,
to anybody, man.

309
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,362
You're not gonna get hurt,
so just calm down.

310
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,186
- Where's your car?
- Up on the road.

311
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,651
I need your keys.

312
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,748
You're being considered
an accessory to this;

313
00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:30,559
you know that, don't you?

314
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,338
I know very little right now.

315
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:35,420
You opened the door to the infirmary

316
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:37,109
that allowed Scofield to escape,

317
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:38,450
didn't you?

318
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:39,404
No.

319
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,556
Did you have a sexual relationship
with Scofield?

320
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:42,420
No.

321
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:44,398
But you had feelings for him.

322
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,249
Seven other men got out, you know.

323
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,196
Who?

324
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,993
Oh, I am sorry, sir.
It's Saturday; we're not open.

325
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,284
Well, that's sort of the point.

326
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,239
Sorry, sir?

327
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:14,608
See,

328
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:17,799
I'm going to need some work done,
and I'm going to need it done...

329
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,943
privately.

330
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,519
I'm sorry,
you said you needed the work done?

331
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,079
This is a medical clinic, isn't it?

332
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,203
Well, of course it is, sir, but for...

333
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,506
animals.

334
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:35,428
God, man, what happened to you?
You need medical attention.

335
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,901
- Sir, listen...
- Hold up.

336
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,563
I'm gonna get an ambulance.

337
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:43,608
Nobody's going to be doing
any calling here,

338
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:45,090
- Doctor.
- Fine.

339
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,336
That's right.

340
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:50,301
Wh-What do you want?

341
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,233
You know what? That's it.

342
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,427
I want Eye-Tie out of the car
right now, man.

343
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,193
That was a little girl!

344
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:05,060
Don't you have a heart?

345
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:07,921
God! I have a daughter.
I have a little girl!

346
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,357
I got one, too.

347
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,945
But if I hadn't done what I had to do,

348
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,843
we wouldn't be on our way
to see 'em right now, would we?

349
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,213
Turn right up there.

350
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,497
Whoa, whoa. Hold on. Where we going?

351
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,282
Oswego.

352
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:25,520
That's west, man. We need to go east.

353
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:27,125
My family's back in Chicago.

354
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:29,296
And you think
the cops don't know about it?

355
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,266
You think
they're not just sitting there,

356
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:33,412
waiting for you to come

357
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:35,129
running back home?

358
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:37,381
What's the matter with you?

359
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,004
Well, what about New York?

360
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,666
What about it?

361
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,736
- My girl's pregnant, bro.
- Understand...

362
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:45,593
your love is your weakness right now,

363
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,801
- ...and they know about it.
- Doesn't mean it has to stop you.

364
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,417
You just got to be smart about it.

365
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:53,938
Get to Oswego.

366
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,496
Oswego was not on the way, Snowflake.

367
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,791
It's not where Oswego is.

368
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:03,096
It's what's in Oswego.

369
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:04,606
Captain,

370
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,740
Scofield's credit card
transaction history.

371
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,507
Spent a lot of money here in Will County
before he was incarcerated?

372
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:11,555
Exactly.

373
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,126
Why does a guy from Chicago

374
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:15,332
come all the way out here
and spend north of 8 grand

375
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,130
in all these places
in little over a month?

376
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:19,052
Car wash, voice mail,
storage, car rental...

377
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,647
- We got guys looking into it.
- Good.

378
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:22,445
What about the Feds,
should we tell them?

379
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:23,290
What do you think?

380
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,132
Captain Bellick? We got something.

381
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:28,039
Hunter up by Tamarack
just ran into five of the cons.

382
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:36,572
So this is where Scofield lived?

383
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:40,018
Yeah, up until about two months ago
when he was incarcerated.

384
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,235
Mother's dead, father's a deadbeat.

385
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:51,163
You got nothing in the whole world
but your brother.

386
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:00,685
So you plan.

387
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,706
And you scheme for months...

388
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:17,112
...till you get it right.

389
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,528
Every single element.

390
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,895
And then you destroy all the evidence.

391
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,652
I want divers down in the river.

392
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:51,219
You won't get cell coverage.

393
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:53,214
We're in the middle of nowhere.

394
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:56,724
Digital carriers don't have cell towers

395
00:22:56,915 --> 00:23:00,581
- way out here in Western Montana.
- How about shutting up, Terrence?

396
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:03,344
Just trying to save you some effort.
These people're like a web.

397
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:05,184
The harder you struggle,
the worse it gets.

398
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,926
Sounds to me like a coward
trying to justify himself.

399
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:11,743
If I stay out of the way and stay quiet,
I stay alive.

400
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,844
That's what they said;
that's what they told me.

401
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,566
And you're willing to live like this,

402
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,776
in a hermetically-sealed box
while everything out there goes to hell?

403
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,127
Self-preservation is a strong motivator.

404
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,040
So is the truth.

405
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:28,296
Don't.

406
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:31,530
Young woman?

407
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,426
Do not.

408
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:45,408
How you doing, buddy?

409
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:47,107
I'm pretty freaked out,

410
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,168
that's how I'm doing.

411
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:51,250
They took your car, didn't they?
1978 Grand Cherokee.

412
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:52,659
- Yeah.
- Which way did they go?

413
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:55,513
Up that way north toward Oswego.

414
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:56,800
Oswego. Pardon me.

415
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,485
Scofield's paperwork, get it, Jimmy.

416
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,289
The credit card stuff.

417
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:02,642
Right here, Captain.

418
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,073
Of course.

419
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:12,804
Where is he going to put
all the crap you need to disappear?

420
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,203
We're going to Oswego, boys.

421
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,774
You have a visitor.

422
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,139
Thank you.

423
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:37,989
Thanks.

424
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:42,065
You look disappointed.

425
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,908
No. I thought
you were going to be my father.

426
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:47,067
You heard from him?

427
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:49,123
His office.

428
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,674
I brought you a change of clothes.

429
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,924
Figured, you know...

430
00:24:57,115 --> 00:24:58,189
Thanks.

431
00:24:58,832 --> 00:24:59,938
And your purse.

432
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,699
You left it in the infirmary.

433
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,603
I'm in a lot of trouble, I think.

434
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:15,032
I...

435
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,875
I need to apologize to you.

436
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,152
They threatened my job
if I didn't talk, and...

437
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:38,405
No, no, no. No.

438
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:42,172
One thing you learn
when you're walking the steps

439
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:44,453
is that you never outsource
a blame that belongs

440
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:45,683
in your own backyard.

441
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:49,916
Well...

442
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:54,448
You're not the first correctional worker
that fell for a con,

443
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:56,302
trust me.

444
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:00,188
He never cared.

445
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:03,560
Not one bit.

446
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:12,108
What are you thinking about?

447
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:15,369
Mistakes.

448
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,745
You had to do it.

449
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,075
Not like I did.

450
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,562
I ruined her life.

451
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:27,761
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it now.

452
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:28,885
That's not true.

453
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:32,865
You fell for her, huh?

454
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,488
Where's Oswego?

455
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:40,507
Half mile maybe.

456
00:26:41,737 --> 00:26:42,657
Good.

457
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,898
What are you going to do,
Terrence, shoot me?

458
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:49,227
Blow my guts all over this house?
Then what?

459
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,405
You can't leave, remember?

460
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:53,970
You kill me, you're stuck with me.

461
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,248
I'm safe here.

462
00:26:57,343 --> 00:26:58,908
You're a prisoner here.

463
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:00,823
But I'm still breathing.

464
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:04,286
If I go outside...

465
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:06,473
...one step...

466
00:27:06,978 --> 00:27:08,057
...I won't be.

467
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:11,804
You look at me

468
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,648
like I'm the devil.

469
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:16,750
I gave up my family,

470
00:27:18,923 --> 00:27:22,286
My teeth. I eat Percocet all day,

471
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,726
just to dull the pain
of my miserable existence.

472
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:27,455
You have no idea what I've been through.

473
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,993
What you've been through?

474
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:33,236
This isn't about you, Terrence.

475
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,258
Don't.

476
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:44,802
<i>Hello?
Blackfoot Sheriff's Department.</i>

477
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:48,758
Hello. My name's Veronica Donovan.
I need you to send a unit to the house

478
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:50,753
at the end of Light Road
as soon as possible.

479
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:51,968
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am,</i>

480
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,465
<i>but are you calling
to report a crime?</i>

481
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:55,529
Yeah.

482
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:58,058
By the President of the United States.

483
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,410
Send the car.

484
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,402
I'm sorry, sir,
I... I don't think I can do this.

485
00:28:04,948 --> 00:28:05,973
There're nerves...

486
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,348
- Look, you need a specialist, Ok?
- I don't.

487
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:11,492
You need somebody
who knows what they're doing.

488
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:13,420
I don't have the luxury of choice here,
Doctor.

489
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,986
My hand has been in that box
for hours now. It is dying.

490
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:17,913
Sir, I am not capable of doing this.

491
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:21,092
I only have one hand,
but I could stick this in your neck

492
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:22,417
before you get to that door.

493
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,235
Now, if that's not incentive enough
for you,

494
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,299
I see that you have
a Mrs. Gudat out there,

495
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:28,409
with a name like that
in a county like this,

496
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:31,320
old Mrs. Gudat would not be too hard
to find now, would she?

497
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,220
Fine.

498
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:35,560
I can promise you nothing.

499
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,498
Story of my life.

500
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,734
I'll have to put you under.

501
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,074
Do I really look that stupid?

502
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:48,724
Sir, I cannot do a procedure like this
without an anesthetic.

503
00:28:48,957 --> 00:28:50,679
I have to cut away dead flesh.

504
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:54,260
Nobody can undergo a procedure like this
without an anesthetic!

505
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:55,797
I ain't...

506
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:57,093
...nobody.

507
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,324
Schweitzer was the plumbing company
that made the toilet

508
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:04,374
Scofield took off
to get out of his cell.

509
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:05,727
Allen bolt was the fitti.

510
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,643
It's all here, isn't it?

511
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:10,380
It's amazing.

512
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:15,191
Ripe Chance Woods. Is there a place
in the vicinity with that name?

513
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,468
Got someone looking into it.

514
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:19,229
DOC's moving
on a storage facility in Oswego.

515
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:35,586
Captain!

516
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,060
Manager says that Scofield's
got a lease on unit 164.

517
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,221
It's still active.

518
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:42,680
We got guys on 8th Street,
3rd Street, then the alley.

519
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,634
If they're in there, Captain,
we got 'em boxed.

520
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:45,919
We push right up the gut, then.

521
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,644
Any one of them
makes a threatening move,

522
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:49,669
- put a hole in 'em.
- You got it.

523
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:52,922
Officer!

524
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,209
This is my collar, smart guy.
Back the hell off.

525
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,003
Close the door.

526
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:17,530
Still nothing on this place?

527
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:19,755
Nope. They're coming back with nothing.

528
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:24,539
No place by that name
anywhere in this country.

529
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,045
Or any other country, for that matter.

530
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:41,738
Let's go.

531
00:30:58,165 --> 00:30:59,651
Son of a bitch set us up.

532
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:34,919
Not one word.

533
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,172
Officer...

534
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:45,654
Nothing.

535
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,194
Oh, that kid's clever.

536
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:54,551
It's not a place, it's a name.

537
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:57,133
Your PDA, you got it?

538
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:58,696
Yeah.

539
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,825
Bring up the census of this county.

540
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:04,059
Far back as it goes.

541
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,814
Somebody's going to see us.

542
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,126
Keep digging.

543
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,835
We're gonna go to hell, guys.

544
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,082
Swear to God, we're gonna go to hell.

545
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:20,571
Help me out.

546
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:30,500
You are one sick cat, you know that?

547
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:35,685
What are you looking for?

548
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:41,001
We got to go to the cemetery.

549
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:42,892
Now.

550
00:32:47,857 --> 00:32:49,370
Originally, this was supposed to be

551
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:51,272
a week's worth of clothes
for me and Linc.

552
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:54,146
But, uh, figured you all need
just as much help as we do, so...

553
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:56,770
You're just doing this out
of the goodness of your heart, Fish?

554
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,608
That's right, John, the heart.
You remember what that is, don't you?

555
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:01,495
Damn, Snowflake, this is tight, man.

556
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:04,606
It's like I said,
we got to stops being cons,

557
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,035
start being civilians.

558
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:25,087
Nice.

559
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:27,562
Trousers are a little bit too short,
don't you think?

560
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:29,553
Chop your feet off. You're good at that.

561
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:31,756
This jacket ain't exactly
the best thing,

562
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:32,809
you know what I'm saying?

563
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,511
You want variety, hit Target.

564
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,302
Linc.

565
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:43,074
What do we got?

566
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:47,958
Money, passports...
pre-paid phone cards.

567
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:52,235
- Archie Ryan?
- Did you see mine?

568
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:53,614
Phineas McClintock.

569
00:33:57,904 --> 00:33:58,907
These?

570
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:02,713
Keys to a car that's waiting for us
a couple hundred yards from here.

571
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:04,295
That a two-of-us or five-of-us?

572
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:05,511
That's a two-of-us.

573
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:07,988
They know?

574
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:09,380
Not yet.

575
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,535
Guy-Guy-Guys, we got company.

576
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,956
Guys, we got to roll.

577
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:10,386
How did he know?

578
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,914
We're civilians; remember that.

579
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:04,089
Civilians.

580
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:08,683
I'm sorry. Do you know what time it is?

581
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,975
No, sorry.

582
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,744
I can't go outside.

583
00:36:26,806 --> 00:36:28,852
They'll kill me
as soon as I show my face.

584
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:30,199
You're wrong about that.

585
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:33,170
As soon as you show your face,
this whole thing is gonna be over.

586
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:35,212
You can have your life back, Terrence.

587
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:37,795
- Promise?
- I promise.

588
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:42,338
Hello.

589
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,114
V, it's me.

590
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,308
- Linc?
- We're out.

591
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,425
Thank God you're okay. I saw the news.

592
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:51,086
You got to stop.
I need you to turn yourself in.

593
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,159
What?

594
00:36:52,237 --> 00:36:53,997
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc.

595
00:36:54,176 --> 00:36:57,217
He's alive.
You're going to be exonerated.

596
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,413
Come in.

597
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,647
What are you talking about,
you found Steadman?

598
00:37:03,173 --> 00:37:04,293
Terrence, come on, let's go.

599
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,404
Afternoon.

600
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,729
The police are here.
Look, I need you to stay where you are.

601
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:10,183
Ma'am.

602
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:11,484
I don't want to lose you.

603
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,210
Ma'am, put the phone down.

604
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:14,640
What?

605
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:16,588
Mr. Steadman, take a few steps back.

606
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,870
Ver... Veronica.

607
00:37:23,192 --> 00:37:24,234
Oh, my God.

608
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,022
I thought you knew that all calls

609
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:11,026
to the local station
are routed through us.

610
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:12,945
This is federal land, remember?

611
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,936
And, uh, as for your little toy here,
it's contraband.

612
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:19,945
You gonna tell us
how you got it in there?

613
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:22,147
I brought it-- when I got here.

614
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,713
Whatever for?

615
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,083
To protect myself.

616
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:29,593
That's what we're here for, remember?

617
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:43,440
<i>In less than a day,
the trail has gone cold</i>

618
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,774
<i>in the pursuit
of what are now being called...</i>

619
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:47,789
Yeah, that's fine.
Stay on top of it, all right?

620
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,079
DOC's still doing a sweep of Oswego,
but the guys have basically vanished.

621
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:53,247
I wouldn't be so sure about that,
Mr. Ives.

622
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,944
I don't know
how you can be so confident.

623
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:57,191
It's not like these guys
left a map where they're going.

624
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,043
Actually, that's exactly what they did.

625
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:03,420
Scofield had the entire thing
on his body--

626
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,412
<i>how to get out of that prison,
how to disappear afterward.</i>

627
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,194
<i>It's all there.</i>

628
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,250
I promise you
that it's only a matter of time

629
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:13,215
before we know

630
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,548
<i>everything that is in Scofield's head--</i>

631
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,328
<i>where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there.</i>

632
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:23,553
<i>So when the time comes
that he does get there,</i>

633
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,199
we'll be waiting for him.
