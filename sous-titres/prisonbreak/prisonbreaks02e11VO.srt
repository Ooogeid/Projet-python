00:00:00,916 --> 00:00:02,313
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,069
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:08,148
You can't kill.

4
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:09,939
I will get you.

5
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:11,018
This is...

6
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:13,753
in case you run into trouble

7
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:14,909
down the road.

8
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:17,398
Lincoln, he really wants to see you
and your brother.

9
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,550
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was ten years old.

10
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:21,404
Let's go.

11
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,174
Michael never met your grandfather.

12
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,458
Dad.

13
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,470
- I got Burrows.
- Take care of them.

14
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,695
I think there's a part of me
that enjoys this.

15
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:31,262
It feels to me like chasing a high.

16
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,439
And I should know better

17
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:34,766
by now.

18
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:41,265
Hi, Sara.

19
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:43,076
Hey, what is this?

20
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:46,644
It's for my... blood pressure.

21
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:48,910
Geary, come on, we can make a deal, man.

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,755
No deals.

23
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:51,986
You just crapped out
your last bargaining chip, pal.

24
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:54,624
Ain't that the most beautiful thing
you ever seen?

25
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,927
This is the Tribune police.

26
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:26,994
This is the Tribune police.

27
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:28,670
Make yourself known.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,788
Hey, you're in luck.

29
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,894
Had a case in back.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,040
Excellent.

31
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,908
Fishing reel oil.

32
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:54,959
And you want the whole case?

33
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:58,927
Whole case.

34
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,852
And the GPS?

35
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:04,610
And the GPS.

36
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:06,710
Must do quite a bit of fishing.

37
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:08,565
Yeah, a lot of fishing...

38
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:10,375
not a whole lot of catching.

39
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:13,496
$96.23.

40
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,225
I'm just going to take the reel oil.

41
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:29,873
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:39,914
You have to pay for that.

43
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,700
Just take it. Please, don't hurt me.

44
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:52,495
Please.

45
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:08,800
<i>You have to pay for that.</i>

46
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,036
The vault. Open it.

47
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:13,404
<i>One for the team.</i>

48
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,660
<i>I wasn't going for me,</i>

49
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,687
<i>I was going for my daughter.</i>

50
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:23,960
Give Anna her papa's love.

51
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:28,639
I'm going cut your throat out.

52
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,397
<i>I loved you, Michael.</i>

53
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,863
You just used me.

54
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:34,922
Cops found your girlfriend

55
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,700
fish-belly white, gargling her own puke.

56
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:41,377
And what do you care?
As long as she left the door open.

57
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,680
I feel very fortunate to have met you.

58
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:47,872
I'm sorry, Henry.

59
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:12,613
It's about corporate interests
taking over the government...

60
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:14,251
buying elections,

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,915
fighting wars...

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,640
People dying so they can turn a profit.

63
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,845
We're trying to stop it.

64
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,875
What are you, a bunch of spies?

65
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,276
Just a handful of senators, congressmen,

66
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,953
people like me that once worked
for the company.

67
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,454
People willing to expose

68
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,148
the President for what she is...

69
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:34,417
A shill working for these corporations.

70
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,746
We bring her down, we bring them down.

71
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:38,761
What's it got to do with me?

72
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,747
Because the way we're going
to bring her down

73
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:42,848
is also what we're going to use
to set you free.

74
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,349
About a week ago,
we finally got a break.

75
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:47,121
An NSA analyst

76
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:48,733
sympathetic to our cause

77
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,652
finally worked his way up

78
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,451
and got clearance
into the Echelon program.

79
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,428
E- mails, cell phone calls

80
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,542
all across this country,

81
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,809
if it's transmitted,
it goes through Echelon.

82
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:01,716
It's catalogued, interpreted,

83
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:03,949
and then stored for Homeland Security.

84
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:05,587
Nothing is missed by them.

85
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:07,134
Nothing.

86
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,545
Including, by accident,

87
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,991
for a few months after 9-11...

88
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:14,919
the White House.

89
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:18,037
The analyst got his hands
on a phone conversation

90
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:20,910
the president had
with Terrence Steadman...

91
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:24,209
two weeks after
you supposedly killed him.

92
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:29,858
Now, the analyst tried to get
this information out of the building...

93
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:34,993
but it turns out,
someone else was snooping, too.

94
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,832
Someone else wanted answers

95
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,616
about the president.

96
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,653
Aldo and Lincoln want to be left alone.

97
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,867
Sure, I understand.

98
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:56,973
24 hours later, Tancredi is dead,

99
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:58,746
the analyst is missing,

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,362
and the White House Echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

101
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:07,562
The tape is still out there.

102
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,235
And judging by how hard
they're going after Sara Tancredi,

103
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:13,338
I'm pretty sure they think she has it.

104
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,812
And I think they're right.

105
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,674
She's the key to this whole thing,
Lincoln.

107
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,881
I would imagine

108
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:40,234
that you're feeling
slightly betrayed right now.

109
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,258
I understand.

110
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,168
As you can see,

111
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,249
hi, my name is not Lance,
and I'm not an addict.

112
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,735
There is one thing about me

113
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:05,994
that should mean
a great deal to you right now.

114
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,438
That is I am reasonable.

115
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,844
If you tell me what you know,

116
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,308
you get to go.

117
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:12,652
Then maybe

118
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,039
when this is all behind us,

119
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:16,281
we get to grab a piece of pie
for old times' sake.

120
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:26,831
I don't know where Michael is.

121
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:29,100
This is not about Michael,
this is about your father.

122
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:33,148
He left washington with something
that didn't belong to him.

123
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:34,516
We need it back.

124
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:35,672
And you killed him for it.

125
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,171
I didn't, no,

126
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:38,954
for what that's worth.

127
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:41,073
But I hope that his death

128
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,845
properly illustrates the magnitude

129
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:45,971
of the situation
that we're in right now.

130
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,112
So, where is it?

131
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

132
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:55,899
Where is it?

133
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,156
I don't know what you're talking about.

134
00:09:58,195 --> 00:09:59,274
Where is it?

135
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:02,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

136
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,107
Sara, there's a next step
involved in this,

137
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,700
and you don't want to experience that.

138
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:16,140
I swear to God I don't know
what you're talking about.

139
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,893
My father didn't give me anything.

140
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,298
I don't know what you're talking about.

141
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,163
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

142
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,439
How long has it been
since your last confession?

143
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,789
This is my first time.

144
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,624
In a long time.

145
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:56,776
Are you aware of the nature
of your sins?

146
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,801
The nature?

147
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:03,347
I'm not really sure.

148
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,911
Deep down inside your heart, you know.

149
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,654
Righteousness, maybe.

150
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,461
Believing the ends justify the means.

151
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:16,623
What are those ends?

152
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,714
Saving someone's life.

153
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,880
And the means?

154
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,546
I've broken just about
every law you can name.

155
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:28,974
But it's not just what I've done.

156
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,761
It's what others have done...

157
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:35,385
because I let them.

158
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,941
Because I was doing
what I thought was right.

159
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:42,020
I should have known better this time.

160
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,177
This time?

161
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,366
When I was a kid...

162
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,464
I watched a man bleed out and die.

163
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:58,138
And I was glad...

164
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:01,645
because he deserved it.

165
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:04,737
Life is only for God
to give and take, my son.

166
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,860
Suddenly, there is this dark space
inside of me.

167
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:11,307
And I knew it was wrong.

168
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:15,128
But here I am.

169
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:16,960
There is a way to stop this.

170
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:19,277
Surrender your will to God.

171
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:20,920
If I surrender now,

172
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,705
I lose everything that I love.

173
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:29,339
But do you lose your soul
in the process?

174
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:35,087
Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

175
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,615
You okay?

176
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,300
This is never gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming after us.

177
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,597
Lincoln, don't.

178
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:11,416
Is it done?

179
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,231
You are.

180
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:17,842
Lincoln Burrows.

181
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,138
Your man's dead.

182
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,419
Just like anyone else you send
to take out my son.

183
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,183
We want you.

184
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,172
This isn't about L. J.

185
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,503
There's a very simple way
for all of this to end.

186
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,050
I'll tell you how it's going to end.

187
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,573
Me staring in your dead eye
with my hand around your throat.

188
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,810
You don't even know who I am.

189
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,101
How much further?

190
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,197
Right here is good.

191
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,106
Alright, you got it.

192
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,650
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

193
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,820
Agent Mahone.

194
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:20,284
Bill Kim.

195
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:22,990
I'm here to pick you up.

196
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:26,031
I called Kellerman.

197
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:27,996
He's busy right now.

198
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:31,636
Does anyone else know you're here?

199
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:33,623
Good.

200
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,973
Can you open the gate?

201
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,270
And I need a new vehicle.

202
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,304
There's something you should know
about me.

203
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,277
I don't like being out in the field.

204
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:45,510
I only do so when there's been
a screwup.

205
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,980
I'm out in the field, Alex.

206
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:51,515
Then why don't you open the gate?

207
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:52,729
You can hurry back to D. C.

208
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,480
before your shoes get dirty.

209
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,336
We have a lead as to where Burrows
will be meeting up with his brother.

210
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:01,957
It's a place he referred to
as "Bolshoi Booze."

211
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,382
Does that mean anything to you?

212
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,849
Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos
on Scofield's body.

213
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,272
What does it mean?

214
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,524
I don't know yet.

215
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:11,248
You'll need to figure it out
within the next couple of hours.

216
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,943
If Scofield and Burrows
cross the border,

217
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:14,753
they'll be out of your jurisdiction,

218
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,404
and you'll be of no further value
to us.

219
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:21,320
Open the gate.

220
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,572
So you can do what?

221
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:24,873
I want to hear it.

222
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:27,592
Straight from the mouth of the guy
who's supposed to be our closer.

223
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:29,787
I'll get Scofield and Burrows...

224
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,011
and all of the rest of them.

225
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:35,439
And then me and you and Kellerman,

226
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,372
we're going to part ways.

227
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:40,227
I just hope you're properly motivated.

228
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:54,490
'Cause as long as you do your job,
we'll forget about Shales.

229
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:01,365
And then you can go back
to Colorado and visit your son.

230
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:02,714
Cameron.

231
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:04,042
He's five, right?

232
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,853
Don't you ever mention his name again.

233
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:11,888
There he is.

234
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:15,833
That's what I wanted to hear.

235
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:22,756
You cracking, Alex.

236
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,580
A lot of people are relying on you.

237
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,365
Jane will take care of it.
You can trust her.

238
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,496
I know this is hard,
but it will work out.

239
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:40,632
You have my word.

240
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:43,817
Thank you.

241
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:44,930
Be careful.

242
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:56,032
Listen...

243
00:17:58,382 --> 00:17:59,422
I know.

244
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,801
Jane's gonna look after you.

245
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,820
I don't even know her.

246
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,220
She's all right.
She's been working for dad for a while.

247
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:14,951
I'll see you soon, I promise.

248
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,225
Isn't that the same thing
your dad told you?

249
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:20,931
Yeah, but I mean it.

250
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,908
What now?

251
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,422
Hey, it's me.

252
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:01,940
Just call me when you get this, okay?
It's important.

253
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,676
They're numbers.

254
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:33,957
Is that my payment?

255
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:37,584
Medical nitroglycerine?

256
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:38,875
As promised.

257
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:50,370
You have no idea how hard it is
to get this kind of grade.

258
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,221
Even with my contacts.

259
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:55,148
It's time for your end of the deal.

260
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,997
Where's that plane gonna be?

261
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,212
They call me a couple of hours
before with the drop-off point.

262
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:03,450
It keeps the DEA off our backs.

263
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,685
Since it's going to be a while,

264
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,727
you might want to stay out of the sun.

265
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,355
Is there a problem?

266
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,215
They're my cousins.

267
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,180
Now, after your father

268
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:38,462
accessed this information, he made

269
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:41,332
three calls

270
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,930
from his cell phone, all to you.

271
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,235
What did he tell you?

272
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,589
Just that he was coming back to Chicago.

273
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,004
Good. You're being honest. Good.

274
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:52,123
Now, there's a half an hour

275
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,729
between when your father landed
and when he got home

276
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:56,078
that is unaccounted for.

277
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:59,098
I know you stopped by his office.
Did you see him there?

278
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,518
The last time I saw my father,
he was dead in his study.

279
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:04,406
Did your father have anyone
give you anything?

280
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,478
Do you think that I'm just
withholding information

281
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:08,083
because I like hanging out with you?

282
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,197
If I knew something,
I would tell you. I don't.

283
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,408
I don't know anything about any of this.

284
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,506
Really?

285
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:17,020
Then why did you give your father
the file on Lincoln Burrows?

286
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:19,935
Why did you open the door for Scofield
and help him escape?

287
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:21,837
Why did Scofield send you
those coded notes?

288
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,765
Why did you come to New Mexico
to meet him?

289
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:30,857
Don't try to float
a babe-in-the-woods routine by me.

290
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,954
It's really going to piss me off, so...

291
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,399
come on.

292
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,181
You're okay.

293
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,888
Look, Sara.

294
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:11,041
We're going to have to come
to an understanding.

295
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:12,265
You know that, right?

296
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,437
<i>Yeah, you were right;
they are coordinates.</i>

297
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:24,837
Plug them into your GPS.

298
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,138
They'll take you to a spot
in the New Mexico desert.

299
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,098
It's in the middle of nowhere,
basically.

300
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:30,658
Thanks.

301
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:33,238
<i>Yeah, no problem. Sir,
who are you meeting?</i>

302
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,417
What the hell is he doing?

303
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,671
He's keeping us out of the loop,
that's what he's doing.

304
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,922
I'm constantly running
from the law with a bad heart...

305
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,992
Mexico, where I'm from
has got a lot of great things, but...

306
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,309
health care ain't one of them.

307
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:52,071
You all right?

308
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:54,226
You look a little nervous.

309
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:55,902
I don't do this every day.

310
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,824
I just want to get the information
on that plane and, uh...

311
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:01,231
move on.

312
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:02,373
Is that it?

313
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:03,452
That's it.

314
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:07,313
'Cause I know who you are.

315
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:08,830
You don't have to worry...

316
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:10,239
we can't go within 100 feet

317
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,395
of a federal marshal
to collect the reward,

318
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:15,420
'cause we got U. S. and mexican warrants
on our heads.

319
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:18,078
But this plane to Panama...

320
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:20,162
Sit down.

321
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,182
This is all for your brother?

322
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,798
I got four brothers, two in prison.

323
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:37,018
Accept a call? Yes.

324
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,667
But break them out?

325
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:40,919
<i>Loco.</i>

326
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:44,016
My brother gave me a baseball mitt
for my 14th birthday.

327
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:46,096
I owed him.

328
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,108
You're a better man than I am.

329
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,688
Time will tell.

330
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,730
Shouldn't they have called by now...
about the plane?

331
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:04,955
You know, I...

332
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:06,438
I have a question.

333
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:11,505
I thought that these
came in glass vials,

334
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,452
not plastic.

335
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:18,330
I thought so, too, but the guy

336
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,273
I bought it from
said he packed it in plastic

337
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:23,193
for transportation over long distances
to prevent a fire

338
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,409
or an explosion.

339
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,811
Really?

340
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:29,739
I never heard of that.

341
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:41,084
What's going on?

342
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:43,331
We're going to do
a little quality control test.

343
00:26:43,543 --> 00:26:44,872
It's the best available.

344
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:46,490
We got time.

345
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:21,704
For the last time,

346
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,456
some black male, early 20s,

347
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:26,100
jumped me from behind.
I didn't get a good look at his face.

348
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:27,697
The assailant attacked you from behind?

349
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:28,891
That's what I just said.

350
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:31,273
Yet he managed
to make contact square on your forehead.

351
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:33,806
- That's right.
- With what? A boomerang?

352
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:35,658
Why don't you tell me what happened?

353
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:38,818
Look, I'm a retired correctional officer
out of Illinois.

354
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:42,377
How about showing
some professional courtesy, honey?

355
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,513
<i>This is Roy Geary. Leave a message.</i>

356
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,767
You thieving son of a bitch.

357
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:58,728
You better get down on your knees
and pray to god that I don't find you,

358
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:00,755
because, if I do, mark my words,

359
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:03,015
I'm going to gut you bow to stern.

360
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:08,413
<i>President Reynolds
was in Tallahassee, Florida,</i>

361
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:09,845
<i>early this morning, attending</i>

362
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:12,491
<i>a $5,000-a-plate breakfast fund-raiser</i>

363
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,225
<i>for senator Martin Kleinhenz,</i>

364
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:15,698
<i>who's running for reelection.</i>

365
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:16,980
<i>Later this afternoon,</i>

366
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:18,671
<i>her press conference was derailed</i>

367
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,605
<i>when a reporter asked her to comment</i>

368
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:22,718
<i>on Lincoln Burrows' escape from custody.</i>

369
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,471
<i>She declined.</i>

370
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,523
<i>It's become clear
in her first month in office</i>

371
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:29,701
<i>that she cannot separate herself
from this manhunt.</i>

372
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:31,777
<i>And as long as it continues...</i>

373
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:34,575
<i>pundits say that questions
about Burrows will contin...</i>

374
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:40,799
Ladies.

375
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:42,898
Let's get this party started.

376
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,402
The last 30 years,

377
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:46,423
I've hated you.

378
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:47,868
You walked out on me.

379
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:52,115
You haven't even seen Michael.

380
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:55,639
I've seen him before.

381
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:58,556
Not in the papers, dad.

382
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:03,726
Been trying to work out
what kind of man abandons his family.

383
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:07,929
Now I'm doing the same damn thing.

384
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:11,715
You'll see him again.

385
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,468
I'll make sure of it.

386
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:18,564
How much further?

387
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,047
About three hours.

388
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:28,946
It's gonna be a few minutes.

389
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:30,405
My brother should be here soon.

390
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:32,930
Maybe I should go outside
and make sure he can see me.

391
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:35,468
That's a good idea.
I think I'm gonna send Ernesto to do it.

392
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,758
<i>Ernesto, por favor.</i>

393
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:55,158
<i>Bueno, te veo.</i>

394
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,571
Was that the call?

395
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,362
Yes, it was.

396
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:05,712
About the plane?

397
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,388
<i>Como se llamas?</i>

398
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,621
<i>Agua con azucar.</i>

399
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:13,156
Sugar water.

400
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,929
You just made a big mistake, blanquito.

401
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:17,426
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

402
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,543
I'm not a chemist.

403
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:20,978
The guy I bought it from
swore it was medical nitro.

404
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,425
We both got screwed.

405
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:25,026
But only one of us is gonna pay for it.

406
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:26,576
Look, I just want to get out of here,

407
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:29,331
and you want your payment.
My brother's gonna be here soon.

408
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,334
We'll work something out.

409
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:32,547
Just name your price.

410
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:34,328
I already named my price.

411
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,929
You didn't come through.

412
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:48,020
When's your brother getting here?

413
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,929
You were planning on turning us
in the whole time, weren't you?

414
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,641
When's he supposed to meet you here?!

415
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,739
<i>Sueltalo.</i>

416
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:55,847
Drop it, or I'm gonna shoot him.

417
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:57,234
Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

418
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,126
<i>- Suelta la pistola.
- Ey, no estoy jugando.</i>

419
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,326
<i>Sueltala, cabron!</i>

420
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:05,079
<i>Quieto!</i>

421
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:20,565
- Where is it?
- My father didn't give me anything.

422
00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:25,322
Who you risking your life for?

423
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,521
Lincoln Burrows.

424
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:31,776
Street thug.

425
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:34,910
And why is that your concern?

426
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:37,606
I mean, is there somewhere
in the hippocratic oath where it says,

427
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:39,282
"I pledge to risk my life

428
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,001
for those who don't care about mine"?

429
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:43,003
'Cause they don't care about yours.

430
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:45,407
Burrows and Michael Scofield

431
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,004
just used you.

432
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:50,233
Are you that surprised
that there are people in the world

433
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,768
who will stand up to people like you?

434
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:53,829
Are you that far gone?

435
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:55,563
That's cute.

436
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:57,495
Sad,

437
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,092
but cute.

438
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:17,359
A Cleveland what?

439
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:19,376
Don't worry, I'll talk you through it.

440
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:22,058
And we got a glass coffee table
right here.

441
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:25,869
Hell no.

442
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,470
I'll do it for a thousand.

443
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:28,799
$500.

444
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:30,975
$1,000.

445
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:33,147
$750.

446
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,921
All right.

447
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,631
What the hell?

448
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:01,811
Leave.

449
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:07,464
You know,

450
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,649
it's amazing what you can pick up
at an army-navy store.

451
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:16,033
All that torture stuff,
that was Bellick's idea.

452
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:18,580
And if you ask me,
he took the whole thing way too far.

453
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:19,965
Listen,

454
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:22,689
why don't I just give you
half the money, and we call it a day?

455
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:24,037
All right, 60-40.

456
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:26,438
Come on, T, we can deal.

457
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:34,194
Where's the plane going to land?

458
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,563
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

459
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:43,569
What are we going to do?

460
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:44,953
I don't know.

461
00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:48,280
We're not going to get
across the border on the ground.

462
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,751
Without that plane, we're screwed.

463
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:52,162
He's losing too much blood.
He'll never make it like this.

464
00:33:52,182 --> 00:33:54,261
He should have thought
before he tried to kill us.

465
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,641
We got to take him to a hospital,
or else he'll die.

466
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,625
Please.

467
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,649
The plane, and we'll let you go.

468
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:04,421
<i>Dicelo.</i>

469
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:06,057
<i>Dicelo todo.</i>

470
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:08,215
<i>Dicelo ahora!</i>

471
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,665
Finley road...

472
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,631
off of highway 8,

473
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:21,265
- there's an airstrip there.
- There, okay?

474
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,221
- Now let us go.
- Let's go.

475
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,006
Michael, let's go.

476
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:26,893
Please.

477
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,261
Michael, let's go.

478
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,582
Don't do this, please don't do this.

479
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,078
Let's go.

480
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:37,012
If we were bleeding he would have
not lifted a finger, you know that.

481
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,129
He was gonna kill us both.

482
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:39,830
- Let's go.
- No, that's not true.

483
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:42,071
Michael,
we're going to get to that plane...

484
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:44,268
Let's go now, please.

485
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:45,809
Please don't do this, okay?!

486
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:46,849
<i>Callate!</i>

487
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:49,107
Don't listen to him!

488
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:56,289
I care about you.

489
00:34:57,714 --> 00:34:59,929
This is not what I wanted, Sara.

490
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,239
<i>What's going on with Sara?</i>

491
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:17,069
<i>Has she told you anything?</i>

492
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:21,110
Don't go anywhere.

493
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,702
Not yet.

494
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,920
<i>I trust you've been... persuasive.</i>

495
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:26,673
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

496
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,214
Then kill her.

497
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:32,670
Well, she knows something.

498
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:36,156
You disobey me, you are done.

499
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,835
Do you understand me?

500
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:41,940
<i>Put her in the ground, Paul.</i>

501
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:32,282
Let's go.

502
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:33,965
Hold still.

503
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:37,282
We're doing it wrong.
Let's get out of here.

504
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,406
He's gonna call the cops,
or go get his buddies...

505
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,610
he's not going to make it.

506
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:43,287
We'll call them when we get safe.

507
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:44,867
Let's go, Michael, let's go!

508
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,196
Thank you.

509
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,011
You got to get him
to a hospital right away.

510
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,816
Wait. Wait.

511
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:09,418
Hey, man... forget Finley road.

512
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:13,316
The plane is going to stop
at the seven mile marker

513
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:15,674
on route 4 at sunset.

514
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:17,983
It's going to stop for five minutes.

515
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,487
Then it's going to go to Oaxaca, Mexico.

516
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:21,780
If you miss it,

517
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,294
you're out of luck.

518
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:35,583
He bled out on the way over.

519
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:36,778
Any id?

520
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:38,016
Yeah, Roy Geary,

521
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:40,154
just an out-of-stater.

522
00:37:50,391 --> 00:37:51,624
You know him?

523
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:52,976
He's a friend of mine.

524
00:37:54,057 --> 00:37:55,550
- Mr. Bellick?
- Yeah.

525
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,535
You mind answering a few more questions?

526
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:11,908
<i>It's Pam.</i>

527
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,930
What's going on?

528
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:18,161
I just wanted to say hey.

529
00:38:19,315 --> 00:38:22,281
Well... are you all right?
You said it was important.

530
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:28,226
I know things
got kind of ugly toward the...

531
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:30,929
you know, the end.

532
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:33,638
I got ugly.

533
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:35,856
<i>But I want you to know that,</i>

534
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:38,514
that there were circumstances
that, uh...

535
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:42,199
it was better that you and Cameron

536
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:44,888
that you were not with me.

537
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,102
Why are you telling me this now?

538
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:49,998
If I had to do it all over again...

539
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:53,073
I'd do it different.

540
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:57,640
We'd still be a family.

541
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,198
<i>I'd give anything for that.</i>

542
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:04,569
I just wanted you to know.

543
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,920
What's going on?

544
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,039
<i>Nothing.</i>

545
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,373
I just wanted to call
to say that I was, uh...

546
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:15,590
that I'm sorry

547
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:17,754
<i>about everything.</i>

548
00:39:18,294 --> 00:39:19,681
Where are you right now?

549
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:22,116
<i>I can come get you.</i>

550
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:23,798
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

551
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,050
No, I'm serious.

552
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:26,208
Where are you?

553
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:27,422
One more thing.

554
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:30,510
If you hear anything in the media...

555
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:31,780
<i>What?</i>

556
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,793
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

557
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:41,521
I love you.

558
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:43,290
Give Cam a kiss for me, okay?

559
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:30,496
Well...

560
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:32,807
I'm glad I told you about this place.

561
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:34,890
I'm glad I figured out
how to work a GPS.

562
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:37,174
Could you make it
a little more difficult next time?

563
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:38,194
I owe you one.

564
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,518
No, we're even.

565
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:40,944
But we got to leave.

566
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:46,064
Hey, buddy.

567
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:48,086
How are you doing?

568
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,739
- Where's LJ?
- Safe.

569
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,227
- The money?
- I'll tell you later; we got to go.

570
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:53,517
I brought someone.

571
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:56,246
Dad?

572
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:12,258
We've met before.

573
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:39,639
This is happening right now, okay?

574
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,488
Don't make me do this.

575
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:43,175
Don't make me do this.

576
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:46,406
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

577
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:47,889
You wouldn't? Really?

578
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:49,639
Are you that stupid?

579
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,200
Are you that stupid?!

580
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,345
Because now you're going to die!

581
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:55,100
You're going to die,

582
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:58,278
and all you had to do
is tell me what your father gave you.

583
00:41:59,742 --> 00:42:01,071
I know my options.

584
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:05,144
I can not tell you and die,
or I can tell you and still die.

585
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:07,263
No. Wrong.

586
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,108
Come on, smarten up!

587
00:42:10,955 --> 00:42:12,111
For once in your life.

588
00:42:13,078 --> 00:42:14,291
Please.

589
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,327
Go to hell.

590
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:32,064
Drowning is horrific...

591
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:33,394
don't get me wrong...

592
00:42:33,432 --> 00:42:35,898
but once you give in
and let the water come into your lungs,

593
00:42:35,955 --> 00:42:38,758
there's a certain euphoria... I hear.

594
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:40,057
I guess as a junkie,

595
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,844
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

596
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:47,716
You did this to yourself.
