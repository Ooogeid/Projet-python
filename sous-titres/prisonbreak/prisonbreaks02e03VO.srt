1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,210
<i>Previously on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,004
Hey, yo, we're headed out man.

3
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:05,904
Good luck.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,812
I hope you find the girl, buddy.

5
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:09,156
Baby, what the hell is going on?

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,310
Yeah, well Hector says
that you can serve your full sentence.

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,172
What are you doing here,
where's Maricruz?

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,252
She's with me now.

9
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,710
What's this I hear about you
coming home soon?

10
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,084
You're not getting your daughter's
hopes up, are you?

11
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:21,369
<i>You sitting down?</i>

12
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:23,370
Your man is coming home this week.

13
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,676
We can make it to the courthouse
on foot from here.

14
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,070
You don't understand,
everything is in that car.

15
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,960
I've been clean for 18 months now.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,310
I want to help people get
from where I've been to where I am.

17
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:41,080
You were right. I should never have
gotten you involved in this.

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,689
I just need to know

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,805
what Michael scofield wanted from you
in exchange for the green card.

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,689
<i>Caroline, I've been doing this
for 15 years</i>

21
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,867
and it's never been about
anything other than you,

22
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,317
your family and,
most importantly, this country.

23
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,510
Now, I need to know
who I'm working for here.

24
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,720
You are working for me.

25
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,588
Are you aware of any arrangement

26
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:03,140
officer Bellick had with any inmate
regarding prison industries?

27
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:04,950
Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.

28
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,950
Officer Brad Bellick, you're terminated,
effective immediately.

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,070
<i>They just announced
the rewards on the TV.</i>

30
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,552
How much?

31
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,050
<i>$100,000 a piece.</i>

32
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:20,067
The money is just outside
of Tooele, Utah.

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,216
<i>I got the man! He's on the wall!</i>

34
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,232
Truck!

35
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,363
Get men in all the area hospitals.

36
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,422
Wherever they are,
one of them is bleeding good.

37
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:35,469
We got to move.

38
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,759
I can't.

39
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:45,090
You put in all that work,
break out of prison,

40
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,262
only you end up dead
at the bottom of a ditch.

41
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:49,272
Kind of sad really.

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,547
So which one of them was it?

43
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,486
12 HOURS EARLIER (del vo)

44
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:05,484
We've got a blanket
on all the hospitals.

45
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:06,620
Free clinics?

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,519
If they've got band-aids and bactine,
we've got a body in there.

47
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,188
The brothers come in for medical,

48
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:13,613
they're getting it in a van
on the way back to Fox River.

49
00:02:13,614 --> 00:02:15,120
Anything break on the other six?

50
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:18,181
Eyes and ears on the families.
So far, no hits.

51
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,652
Maybe just laying low.

52
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,050
What's the hardest thing
in the world for a con to do?

53
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Nothing?

54
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,988
- Few things in life are certain, Ms...
- Lang.

55
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,138
Death, taxes and the fact
that a man on the run

56
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:30,960
will make a mistake sometime
in the first 72 hours.

57
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,881
Needing distance, he'll steal a car.
Needing money, he'll rob a store.

58
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,811
Needing help, he'll trust
someone that he shouldn't.

59
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,640
And when he does...

60
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,709
he will leave behind the crumbs
that will take us right to him.

61
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,800
I need your help.

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,176
Michael, what are you doing here?

63
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,542
Cayenne pepper.

64
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,655
What?

65
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:56,691
In your kitchen, do you have any?

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,060
Yeah, maybe.

67
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:01,255
I'm gonna need some rubbing alcohol,

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,110
some towels and pain killers,
whatever you got.

69
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,460
And some booze.

70
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,580
Please!

71
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,970
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

72
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,450
it's fine, man, let's just keep moving.

73
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,910
We keep moving
and that leg keeps bleeding.

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,180
The leg keeps bleeding
and we're not getting out of Illinois.

75
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:30,385
This is going to hurt.

76
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,280
That's good, that's good, that's good.

77
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,110
This will seal the capillaries.

78
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,533
Michael, you should not have come here.

79
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,340
The police have been here
asking questions.

80
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:44,362
We didn't have a choice.

81
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,049
Listen, you know I'm thankful
for the help with the green card,

82
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,077
- but I just don't wanna get involved.
- I know.

83
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,111
Iit wasn't part of our deal,
I know, I know.

84
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,449
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

85
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,171
But there was nowhere else to go.

86
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,700
When I saw you on the news,
I was worried.

87
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,340
I just hoped you'd crossed
the border by now.

88
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,283
So did I.

89
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,210
Keep giving him these.

90
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,849
See if you can find him
some clean clothes.

91
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,997
I got to go back and get our car.

92
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,536
Forget the car. We can get another.

93
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,790
I don't need a car, I need that car.

94
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:20,900
Why?

95
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,343
Because in that car...

96
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:28,023
everything we need to disappear.

97
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,154
What have you got?

98
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:13,530
Here we go boss, one of the blues
hauled in a vagrant a couple hours ago.

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,953
Seems the man was in possession
of an item or two

100
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:17,690
that didn't exactly belong to him.

101
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:31,030
Looks like we got our first mistake.

102
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:17,200
Hey, you got any of that oriental jerky?

103
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,660
Excuse me?

104
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,070
Teriyaki flavor.

105
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,520
You got any in the back?

106
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:28,720
Let me check.

107
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,898
And, uh, give me a bottle
of that Early Times

108
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,199
while you're back there, junior.

109
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,288
Feel free to earn your paycheck today.
Watch the store, I'll be right back.

110
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,513
How goes it, Roy?

111
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,333
To be honest, Roy, I could've done
without the knee to the junk.

112
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
You beat me, Brad.

113
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,307
Like a little girl, you beat me.

114
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:02,620
Well, you had it coming.

115
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,110
Yeah, probably did.

116
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,310
You know it's crazy, us taking it out
on each other for how things turned out.

117
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,700
You want someone to blame,

118
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,110
how about those convicts staring up
at us from the papers every morning.

119
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,530
They took my job,

120
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,470
my pension,

121
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,730
my dignity.

122
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,897
When they went over that wall,they took
all of it right along with them.

123
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:25,990
Everything I worked for my whole life.

124
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:29,120
Did you see that reward they got?

125
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,899
Those ass-hats are worth more dead
than you and I are alive.

126
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,340
Not for long.

127
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,610
What do you mean?

128
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,620
I mean somebody's going to get
that money, might as well be me.

129
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,757
You know a job like that might

130
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:46,220
go a little smoother with
an extra pair of hands.

131
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,800
You really think I'm going
to split that reward with you?

132
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,150
I'm just saying, you run into
those brothers,two of them, one of you.

133
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,210
You might find yourself
wishing for a good wingman.

134
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,490
Just get it done, Mike.

135
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,070
How are you doing?

136
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,200
May I help you?

137
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,880
Yeah, I hope so, Chuck.

138
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,850
I think you may have towed my car.

139
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,780
What did it look like?

140
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:24,940
<i>What did it look like?<i>

141
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,500
The car you stole the backpack from.
What did it look like?

142
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:31,909
I don't know, man, maybe it was gray.

143
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,520
It's a gray Accord.

144
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,265
License number?

145
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:36,713
Look, man, that's all I know.

146
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,690
I wasn't after the car.

147
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,230
Thought the bag had some clothes in it.

148
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,324
You remember where the car was parked?

149
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:44,462
Where'd you park it?

150
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,900
Corner of Hancock and 15th.

151
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:49,499
I don't know, maybe around
15th somewhere,

152
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,820
but it ain't going to be there anymore.

153
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,382
What do you mean?

154
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:57,684
That's the reason I didn't get to grab
anything else. Tow truck rolls up.

155
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,100
Already on it.

156
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,080
It's going to be 60 bucks for the tow,
and 24 for the overnight.

157
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,166
All right, be right back
with your vehicle.

158
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,692
Shouldn't take but a few minutes.

159
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,160
<i>- Hello? - Petey, it's Sucre.

160
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:38,391
<i>As in, Fernando Sucre?</i>

161
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:39,870
Is there another one?

162
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,905
<i>Man, I hope not.</i>

163
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,979
But my boy Sucre would not
be calling me on the telephone,

164
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:47,855
thereby making me an accessory
to his dumb-ass escape, man.

165
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,930
I- I'm sorry, bro, I just...I just...

166
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,190
I just need you to get a hold
of Maricruz.

167
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:55,105
I can't call her cell because the Feds
will be all over the place...

168
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:58,180
homie, listen, man, you have got
to forget about that girl.

169
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,228
If I could forget about her, pendejo,

170
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,259
I'd still be at Fox River, sitting
in cell 40 on your old bunk.

171
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:05,705
Yeah, well, I hope you're holding on
to something tight

172
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,817
'cause I'm about to break it down
for you, brother.

173
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,610
She's getting married to Hector
on Saturday.

174
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,300
What day is today?

175
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,610
Thursday, bro. Sorry, man.

176
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,663
All right, you got to get her
to your place

177
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:24,357
- tonight.
<i>- Hang on, man...</i>

178
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:26,800
I got one last shot to make her
change her mind, dude.

179
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,734
Just find a way to get her there, okay?

180
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,460
Wait... Sucre, hang on, man.

181
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:06,880
And...

182
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,528
about the broken window.

183
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,878
We got a disclaimer
posted right there on the wall...

184
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,710
I don't...I don't... I don't care about
the broken window, Chuck.

185
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,750
I had a backpack inside.

186
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,262
Not when we got it.

187
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,810
I got some paperwork
for you to fill out.

188
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,210
You look familiar.

189
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,980
Yeah, you...

190
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,410
you were the attending
when I first started here.

191
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,770
Sure.

192
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:44,460
Would one of you mind
calling me a cab, please?

193
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,570
I don't think so.

194
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,250
Look, dr. Tancredi, I...

195
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,090
I just want to say good luck.

196
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,770
- Sara Tancredi?
- I'm sorry.

197
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,412
You have the right to remain silent.

198
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,303
Please place your hands
behind your back.

199
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,767
If you have any questions,
I'm happy to come...

200
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:04,120
Ms. Tancredi, out of respect for
your father, I'm going to ask you again.

201
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,490
My father?

202
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm sure he'd prefer that
this went without incident.

203
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,922
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

204
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:12,530
before you speak to the police.

205
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,580
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

206
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:19,509
And to have an attorney present
during questioning now or in the future.

207
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,220
Caroline, they're taking her in.

208
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,681
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

209
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:32,090
All you got to do is sign here
at the bottom,

210
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,184
and be on your way.

211
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,210
Excuse me, please.

212
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,632
Brewster's towing.

213
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,238
This is agent Mahone with the F.B.I.

214
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,473
Who am I speaking with?

215
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,392
Chuck.

216
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,832
Okay, Chuck, I want to alert you
to a possible situation.

217
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,231
Are you listening to me, Chuck?

218
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:51,864
<i>An individual may be coming there
to inquire about a vehicle.</i>

219
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:54,750
<i>A gray Accord, probably
with a busted rear window.</i>

220
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,060
Has anyone come by looking for a vehicle
that matches that description?

221
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,850
Yes, sir.

222
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,387
When?

223
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,013
Will you tell me when he was there?

224
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,080
Right now.

225
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,893
Brewster's towing. Scofield's there.

226
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,070
Chuck, stall him.

227
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,228
- Stall him.
- Scofield,

228
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:31,080
- the I.D.?
- Don't let him leave, okay?

229
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,534
It's my supervisor, he's, he...

230
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,384
I just got to get clearance
before I can release the car.

231
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,350
<i>Chuck, you there?</i>

232
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:39,540
<i>Hey, Chuck!</i>

233
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,700
Okay, come on, come on,
Chuck, you still with me?

234
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:47,656
Yeah, that vehicle might not be here
when you get here.

235
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,100
You need to send somebody now.

236
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,820
Do not let him leave!

237
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,162
Oh, he got the keys.

238
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,460
Where the hell are those units?

239
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,270
Still six or seven minutes out, sir.

240
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,290
We got chatter. It's Franklin.
He's at a payphone downtown.

241
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,170
Mistake number two.

242
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:18,430
Look, I know.

243
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,755
I know, baby, just let me explain,
all right?

244
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,040
Were you ever even in the military?

245
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,990
I served my country,
and my country served me up.

246
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:27,614
All right?

247
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:31,170
Now, look, I wish I could lay this
all out for you right here, right now.

248
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,780
<i>But just know, baby, I am sorry,
and I love you,</i>

249
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:37,890
<i>and when the time comes,
I will explain everything.</i>

250
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,300
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't turn you in right now.

251
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,070
You know what? I'll give you three.

252
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:46,854
Me,

253
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:50,833
<i>you, and that beautiful little girl
of ours. Baby, look.</i>

254
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,118
I got a plan.

255
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,293
I got a plan

256
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:55,209
<i>that's gonna get us some money,</i>

257
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:57,849
<i>where you and I and our baby</i>

258
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,940
<i>nobody can ever find us
or bother us again.</i>

259
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,310
You gotta trust me.

260
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,730
All I need is the opportunity for you
to hear me out. All right?

261
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,593
All right.

262
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,360
All right, listen.

263
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,990
Has anybody tried
to contact you about me?

264
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,004
No.

265
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:21,007
Okay.

266
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,163
<i>Okay, that's good, that's good.</i>

267
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,384
<i>Listen.</i>

268
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,054
<i>In the rainbow room...</i>

269
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,560
Restaurant, New York city.

270
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,429
<i>...Do you remember</i>

271
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,670
that beautiful spot
where we took that picture?

272
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:40,190
The one by the window?

273
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:51,230
I am going a be waiting in that spot
one week from now.

274
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,266
<i>And that's all that I want</i>

275
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:55,762
<i>in this whole world</i>

276
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,872
is for my two girls
to be waiting there for me.

277
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,530
Do you understand what I'm saying?

278
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:01,230
Look, I got to go.

279
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,670
<i>Baby, I just want to know,
are you going to be there?</i>

280
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,470
<i>I don't know.</i>

281
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,300
But you know me.

282
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,890
<i>- Do I?</i> - Yes!

283
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,990
Good-bye, Miles.

284
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,754
I'll alert the office in Manhattan,

285
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:27,698
have them send Franklin's picture
to every employee at the rainbow room.

286
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:29,798
Then go have a chat with his wife,
woman-to-woman.

287
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,412
Ask her why she never once
visited her husband at Fox River.

288
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,106
Pretend you don't know the answer.
That relationship is fragile.

289
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,558
We keep tapping on cracks,
and she's going to break.

290
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,760
Yes, sir, I appreciate
the assignment. I...

291
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,190
Lang, I don't need gratitude.

292
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,500
I need leads, answers, progress.

293
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,600
Anybody that can't deliver that
just don't even unpack. Clear?

294
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,310
Yes, sir.

295
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,090
Mr. Wheeler.

296
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,189
Stand by.

297
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,954
Stay on Scofield. I want the license
plate number on that Accord

298
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,717
and I want you
to get it out on the wire.

299
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,144
Yeah.

300
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,673
Now.

301
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,860
I'll call you back.

302
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,020
What's going on?

303
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,320
Apparently, I wasn't the only one
looking for this car.

304
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,373
Right.

305
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,590
Let's get out of here.

306
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,370
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

307
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,800
I mean, any more than I already have.

308
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,800
Good luck.

309
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:37,860
To you, too.

310
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,036
So...

311
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,231
I'll see you.

312
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:50,717
I hope so.

313
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,680
You all right?

314
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:07,396
Yeah.

315
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,177
Good.

316
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,952
We're heading west,
toward the money, toward L.J.

317
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,330
We just got one more stop to make.

318
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,200
What for?

319
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:20,560
You trust me?

320
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,466
Of course I trust you, Brad.

321
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:25,493
It's just that if anybody
finds out about this,

322
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,040
- I...
- They won't.

323
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,276
Let me handle this.

324
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,385
Humpty Dumpty climbed up a wall.

325
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,610
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

326
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,580
Look...

327
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,079
I already told the Feds
I don't know anything, okay?

328
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,515
Those suits with pedicures
and penny loafers. Why would you?

329
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,960
They have rules to follow,
codes of conduct.

330
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,703
They got jobs to protect.

331
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,650
Now me, on the other hand...

332
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:00,877
Come on, boss.

333
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:02,090
I swear.

334
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,240
Those guys didn't let me in
on any plans.

335
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:08,561
Then you're telling me in all
your little powwows in the yard

336
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:11,376
they never once mentioned
what they were going to do

337
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,030
once they went over that wall?

338
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:14,367
That's right.

339
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,950
Now...

340
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,305
I may not work here anymore, Big-Hic,

341
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,693
but I still got influence
with people who do,

342
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:29,380
people who will do
whatever I ask them to

343
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,230
to whoever I ask them to.

344
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,050
And a...

345
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:40,400
curvy man like yourself...

346
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,066
Well, let's just say there's
some filthy individuals

347
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,367
who might enjoy a cellie

348
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:48,450
with womanly attributes.

349
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,545
Now, you're going to tell me
everything you know

350
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,450
about where those convicts are headed,

351
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:03,197
or I'm going to throw
your fat ass to the wolves.

352
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,280
Okay, thanks.

353
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,919
Mistake number three:

354
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,667
Someone reported seeing a man

355
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:16,749
matching Fernando Sucre's
description stealing a car.

356
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,173
- Where?
- Defiance, Ohio.

357
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,776
Someone's going down today.

358
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,890
I know, mami, I know.

359
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,360
Sara...

360
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,900
- I paid your bail.
- You took your time.

361
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,992
I'm the governor.

362
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,920
- I do have things that...
- Go to hell, dad.

363
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,260
You keep this up, this may be
the only place I'll be able to see you.

364
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,719
Do you even want to hear
my side of things?

365
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,730
Not particularly, Sara, no.

366
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,020
Especially when I have
no idea whose "side" you're on.

367
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,954
But I do know this.

368
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,870
Somebody is going to go down
because of what happened at Fox River.

369
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,462
And it would be in both
of our best interests

370
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:17,559
if that someone was not you.

371
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:20,149
And to ensure this,
certain steps need to be taken.

372
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:23,311
One: You should go
to a daily recovery meeting.

373
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:27,189
Two: You need to go before a judge
and plead not guilty, and three,

374
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:29,809
- dad, I don't...
- you need to tell the D. O. C.

375
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:33,079
everything you know about
how that prison was being run.

376
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:36,200
And that warden Pope,
how he was granting favors to Scofield

377
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:38,789
because Scofield helped him
with his personal projects,

378
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:41,504
thereby exposing him
to certain restricted areas

379
00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:45,110
where he may have been able
to obtain a key to the infirmary.

380
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,310
I can't do that.

381
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:51,543
Oh, yes you can, Sara.
You can do that and you will.

382
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,060
I did it, dad.

383
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,629
I left the door open,
me and no one else.

384
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,883
That's not true.

385
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:04,860
- Yes, it is.
- That's not true.

386
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,446
Sara...

387
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,728
just do what you're told,

388
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,295
otherwise there will be consequences...

389
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,051
that will affect us all.

390
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,273
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

391
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,476
Yes, I do.

392
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,338
Good.

393
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,868
In one week...

394
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,474
I will be appointed the new
Vice President of the United States.

395
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:37,173
There will be a ceremony,
you will be invited,

396
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,270
but you will not attend.

397
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,020
Good-bye, Sara.

398
00:22:59,564 --> 00:23:01,190
- Let's put some music on.
- Don't.

399
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,092
I forgot. No radio.

400
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,499
Man, it's quiet out here. Inside,
there was always noise, you know?

401
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:13,760
Someone yelling, guards
making rounds. I got used to it.

402
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:17,035
You're right. We should go back.

403
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,325
The tats...

404
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,638
they weren't just for getting out,
were they?

405
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,590
Breaking out was just the beginning.

406
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,809
Now, it gets a little more interesting.

407
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,822
'cause me being strapped
to the electric chair

408
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,059
wasn't interesting enough?

409
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,649
All I'm saying is inside,
we had the element of surprise.

410
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,730
No one knew what we were planning.

411
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,440
There's something about this guy,
the one in the elevator.

412
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,713
It's like...

413
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,485
It's like he knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

414
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,764
If that's true,
it's just a matter of time

415
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:55,660
before he finds out
about the money in Utah,

416
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,170
Bolshoi Booze, our way into Mexico.

417
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,122
Everything.

418
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,360
Are you ready for this?

419
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,260
Make the call.

420
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,230
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

421
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,097
Hey, it's me.

422
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,761
I've got Linc.

423
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,792
We're on our way there.

424
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:33,630
<i>If for some reason you can't make it,
call me back at 9-1-7-4-5-4...</i>

425
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,772
We just got this from surveillance.

426
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,179
You remember that voicemail Scofield
prepaid for when he went off to prison?

427
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,770
- Yeah.
- Someone just left a message on it.

428
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,151
- Who?
- Scofield.

429
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,856
Something... something about a meeting,

430
00:24:46,891 --> 00:24:49,729
it sounded like he was waiting
for someone else to check the message

431
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:50,689
and then call him back.

432
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,589
This prefix, that's a cell phone number.
As long as it's turned on...

433
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,560
we can track exactly where he is.

434
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:21,670
Don't do anything stupid.
Don't do anything stupid.

435
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,170
Is there a problem, officer?

436
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,620
Do you know why
I pulled you over today, sir?

437
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,620
Speeding?

438
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,490
Let me see your license
and registration please?

439
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,929
The thing is, I, uh...

440
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,880
I- I-I lost my wallet.

441
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:06,560
Well, I guess your registration
will have to do just fine then.

442
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,220
So,

443
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,181
this is your car,

444
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,760
Mrs. Miller?

445
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,784
Mrs. Miller's my wife.

446
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,137
I'm Mr. Miller.

447
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,352
Well.

448
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:32,487
Your tags are expired.

449
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,516
I'll be right back.

450
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,120
Did he sing?

451
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,990
Like a fat, sweaty bird.

452
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,360
Hey, sweet pea.

453
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,351
- Daddy?
- Hey, come here.

454
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,720
Oh, look at you. You're so big.

455
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,099
Hey, why don't you do me
a favor and grab a piece of chalk

456
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:34,799
and draw daddy a picture
on the ground, okay?

457
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,242
So, how're you feeling, huh?

458
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,078
You keeping your appetite up?

459
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:46,730
Sorta. I guess.

460
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,132
That's good. That's real good.

461
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,940
Oh, God, it's so good
to see you, baby girl.

462
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:59,930
Do you understand
what daddy is going through right now?

463
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,133
Sorta.

464
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:04,104
But the kids at school
have been sayin' stuff.

465
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,700
Okay, what have they been saying?

466
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,200
They're saying you're on tv
because you're a bad man.

467
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,867
And what do you think?

468
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,399
I think if I were someplace

469
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,879
and they wouldn't let me
leave to see you,

470
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,120
I wouldn't do what they said, either.

471
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,939
Well, you know what?

472
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,215
We are gonna be together real soon.

473
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,943
I promise you.

474
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:35,018
But daddy needs you to do him a favor.

475
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:37,275
I need you
to get a message to mommy, okay?

476
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,520
Okay.

477
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,430
Now I need you to tell her
if she understood what I told her

478
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,680
and if she is willing to trust daddy...

479
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,410
that she needs to turn on
the porch light at 7:00, okay?

480
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,909
Can you remember that?

481
00:28:57,052 --> 00:28:58,407
That's a good girl.

482
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:01,244
Dede, stay away from the gate, honey.

483
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,370
Daddy gotta get going, okay sweet pea?

484
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:11,196
I love you, daddy.

485
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,275
I love you, too, baby.

486
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,681
There.

487
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,531
It's not much further now.

488
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,189
Okay, they moved off the interstate,
heading north on route 38.

489
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:48,500
Talk to me.

490
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:51,483
Where?

491
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:54,358
There's a patrolman who thinks
he's has Fernando Sucre

492
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,309
pulled over outside
of Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

493
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,819
Get in touch with the local dispatch.

494
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,420
Make it clear that we want
this man in custody, not in a body bag.

495
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,050
Dead men can't tell us where
their friends are. Yeah, you got it.

496
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:49,869
<i>- You got a positive I.D.?
- It's gotta be, it looks just like him.</i>

497
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:52,334
<i>- Yeah?
- Okay.</i>

498
00:30:52,335 --> 00:30:53,325
Thank you.

499
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:55,590
<i>- Pursue with caution.
- I will.</i>

500
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,542
Mr. Miller...

501
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,170
I'm gonna have to ask you to place
your arms outside the vehicle please.

502
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,650
Mr. Miller, I need to see some hands.

503
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:50,883
You ready?

504
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,435
Yeah.

505
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,527
Now.

506
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:11,238
This is the one.

507
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:20,665
- Do you see him?
- Nope.

508
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:22,630
Maybe he didn't get your message.

509
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,110
They've stopped.

510
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,704
Couple miles up ahead. There's...

511
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,893
There's nothing up there. What...?

512
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,700
What are they waiting on?

513
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,834
Or who?

514
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:50,890
All right, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

515
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,046
Oh, come on.

516
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:15,880
Come on!

517
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,498
Go red.

518
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,434
Now, go red!

519
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,680
Just one more thing.

520
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,220
Do you trust me?

521
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,998
Of course.

522
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,864
How do you throw
the hunter off the scent?

523
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,062
Get rid of the prey.

524
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,344
Remember,

525
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,905
once I hit scan, we'll have about
30 seconds before it reaches 103.7.

526
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,296
And then she blows?

527
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,395
That's right. Ready?

528
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,686
Yeah.

529
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:32,895
All right, let's go.

530
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,725
Wait,

531
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,889
The music is not changing.

532
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

533
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,370
Something's wrong.

534
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,546
What happened?

535
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,101
I don't know.

536
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:51,520
But we're going to need the explosion.

537
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,973
He's here.

538
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:08,218
The radio must have jammed.

539
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,719
We're going to have
to set it off manually.

540
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,534
The car could blow any second, Michael.

541
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:15,083
Well, the feds are going
to be here in about two minutes.

542
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,560
If it doesn't look like
we're dead, we will be.

543
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:19,646
Rock, paper, scissors?

544
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,919
- Linc?
- It's my turn.

545
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:40,330
Better pray for reception.

546
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:52,690
How many stations
between 102. 1 and 103.7?

547
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,705
Way out here?

548
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,122
Just one, probably.

549
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:36,906
Where's Maricruz?

550
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,384
- Hey, look, man...
- No, no, Petey. You look.

551
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,571
I haven't slept in 72 hours,

552
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:44,049
I've seen a man's hand
get chopped off, I've been...

553
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,382
I've been shot at, dug up a grave,

554
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:48,520
stolen a car,
jumped on a fricking a train,

555
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,019
so please, just tell me where she is.

556
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,219
Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

557
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,799
I was trying to tell you,
but you hung up the phone, man.

558
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,546
The wedding, it's in Vegas.

559
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,109
The city?

560
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:03,616
Yeah, and they left a few hours ago.

561
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:15,389
Wait, no, no. No, no, no.

562
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,590
Come on, hey, come on. Fernando!

563
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,229
It's pristine, man. It's just...

564
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,340
gonna be back to you
in one piece, I promise.

565
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,360
Can we go back
to the part where I said no?

566
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:24,947
I wish I had another choice.

567
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,329
You do have a choice. Come on, man.

568
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,525
It's a 1952 Ural motorbike, bro.

569
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:32,910
- If you so much as scratch it...
- No scratches...

570
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,709
I promise.

571
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,943
She's the love of my life, bro.

572
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,676
I got to do something.

573
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,340
You look like hell.

574
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,166
I've been through hell, papi.

575
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,318
Now I just got to get to Vegas.

576
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,893
Hi, I'm Sara, and I...

577
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:10,115
over the years, I've worked with...

578
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,600
more than a few people
who had a history of addiction, and...

579
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:19,433
I would tell them that I could
understand what they were going through,

580
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:20,411
because I...

581
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:25,301
used to be just like them.
I used to be an addict, too.

582
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,282
And I think...

583
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,370
I think that what's becoming
clear to me is that...

584
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,420
the reason I understood them is...

585
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,123
because I am like them.

586
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,980
I never used to be an addict. I...

587
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,890
Hi, my name is Sara, and I'm an addict.

588
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,448
Hi, Sara.

589
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,903
Hi, my name's Lance, and I'm an addict.

590
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,239
Hi, Lance.

591
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,668
I guess a lot of what Sara
just said resonates with me

592
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,380
in what I'm going through.

593
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,211
Put in all that work,
break out of prison,

594
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:14,390
only to end up dead
at the bottom of a ditch.

595
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,526
Kind of sad really.

596
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,782
So, which one of them was it?

597
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,817
Shales.

598
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,471
Shales?

599
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,213
S- Scofield. Might be Scofield.

600
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,072
You're probably going
to find his brother in there, too.

601
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,549
Oscar Shales is this guy
Mahone tracked for a while.

602
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:38,124
Nasty little bottom feeder.
You know the type.

603
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,539
He's still in the wind.

604
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:42,420
Can't get 'em all, right?

605
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,600
We should have a pretty clear path
to Utah now.

606
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,800
They'll turn their attention
to the other guys,

607
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,414
which means we'll be
off their radar for a while.

608
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,243
They're going to get the lab results
back from the accident, man.

609
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,150
We'll be in Mexico by that time.

610
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,460
Provided the transport comes through.

611
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:32,910
Oh, come on, baby.

612
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:46,447
<i>In the rainbow room.</i>

613
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:52,507
<i>Do you remember that beautiful spot
where we took that picture,</i>

614
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:54,824
<i>the one by the window?</i>

615
00:40:56,693 --> 00:41:01,720
<i>I am going to be waiting
in that spot one week from now.</i>

616
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,507
She sleeping okay?

617
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,993
Yeah. Like a baby.

618
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,673
Good.

619
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:45,236
So, you said you had some information

620
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,133
you wanted to tell me
about your husband?

621
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,640
Looks like I owe you another one.

622
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,505
It's okay.

623
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:09,320
Well, uh, once we get to Mexico,
I'll send you $10,000, like I promised.

624
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,660
Plus another three for the car.

625
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,440
Are you meeting up with her, the doctor?

626
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,351
Sara?

627
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,719
I, uh...I... I don't know.

628
00:42:23,193 --> 00:42:25,970
We should get moving.
Next town is a few miles away.

629
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:28,781
That's fine.
I can catch a bus from there.

630
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,915
Thanks again, Nika.

631
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:52,709
I knew the little whore
would take us right to 'em.
