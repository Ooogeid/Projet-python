1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,630
Your mother works for us.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,930
Your mother is alive.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,000
You know, i'm thinking more and more that this

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,300
Is an inside job. why?

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,760
The hardware he brought to the meet.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,460
He could read scylla right on the spot.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,400
Hands on your head.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
We've got to get out of here!

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,500
Michael. Get in!

10
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:26,700
Sorry, but right now i want my life back

11
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:27,705
More than i want your money.

12
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:28,807
Where's scylla?

13
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,463
Let's talk about that, okay?

14
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:31,531
Where is it?

15
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:32,461
I can get it.

16
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:33,360
No, he can't.

17
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:34,502
He's stalling, linc.

18
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,601
it's gone. you're right.

19
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:41,732
You have no idea who this guy's working for?

20
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:42,731
No, no clue.

21
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:46,200
Your boy's dead.

22
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:47,233
And now

23
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:48,601
I'm coming after you.

24
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:52,363
Who was that?

25
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:55,203
It was my son.

26
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:56,861
Lincoln.

27
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:09,862
What is this?

28
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,260
I don't know...

29
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,703
Just found them on the doorstep.

30
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:17,700
Son of a...

31
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:25,430
They lay one hand on my mama, i swear on my life...

32
00:01:25,437 --> 00:01:27,563
She's in a state home.

33
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,432
I thought we were working with these people.

34
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:30,701
So did i.

35
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm gonna make a call.

36
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,262
Find out what's going on.

37
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,900
Mr. burrows.

38
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,233
We had a deal.

39
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:47,731
Our deal is contingent upon the retrieval of scylla.

40
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:50,262
Based on the mediocrity of your performance

41
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:51,831
On that front thus far,

42
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:53,732
I thought it best to make sure

43
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:55,630
you're all properly motivated

44
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:58,163
Just tell me how your team is progressing.

45
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:59,630
I swear to god, man, when i,

46
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:00,932
When i get a hold of you...

47
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:02,032
If i were you,

48
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,633
I'd be doing everything in my power

49
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:06,932
To demonstrate my competence right now.

50
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:10,063
We killed the guy who came to miami.

51
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,262
We found some keys on him.

52
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,702
We're looking into them.

53
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:15,031
Are we done?

54
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,202
Not quite.

55
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,601
A new competitor

56
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,160
Has joined the search.

57
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,503
We're the ones getting scylla.

58
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,800
Well, that's good to hear,

59
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,060
Because the competing party, is your brother michael.

60
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:29,562
Michael's with you.

61
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:34,331
Michael's getting treatment. With you.

62
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:37,030
Apparently michael's a little more headstrong than either of us imagined.

63
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,361
But don't worry.

64
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,502
We have a lead on him somewhere in central arizona.

65
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:44,332
Mr. oren is waiting in his limousine.

66
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:46,533
If you speak to michael,

67
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,460
Tell him to find a very good hiding place.

68
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,701
Because if any of my men spot him,

69
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,933
They've been given a green light.

70
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,662
2,500 miles to go.

71
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,261
If we take turns sleeping

72
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,803
We can be there by tomorrow night.

73
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,860
Should we call lincoln? let him know we're coming?

74
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,201
Michael, he took the company's deal

75
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,832
To save your life.

76
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,101
And for what it's worth, i might've done the same thing.

77
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:17,100
Then you'd be wrong, too.

78
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:33,502
You know, this promises to be a really, really long ride.

79
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:36,303
So, how about we just...

80
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:38,400
Call truce, all right?

81
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,333
Forgot napkins.

82
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:46,332
Get down.

83
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:26,162
Come on.

84
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:49,202
He comes anywhere near my kid...

85
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,003
You know, don,

86
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:53,701
You seem to be taking this whole thing pretty well.

87
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:55,403
Yeah, well, i'm a pretty calm guy.

88
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,632
All i'm saying is,

89
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,362
My mama, his son, his wife.

90
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,332
We don't even know who they got on you.

91
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:01,602
That's 'cause it's none of your business.

92
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:02,631
All right, all you need to worry about

93
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:03,833
Is that i'm here to do a job.

94
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,260
Hold-secure.

95
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,033
The company that manufactures the keys.

96
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:08,903
It's called hold-secure. listen to this.

97
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,101
Each key they produce is implanted with a computer chip.

98
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,503
That chip sends out a unique

99
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,061
Electronic signal that opens its lock.

100
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:15,600
Something that high-tech,

101
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,463
I'm telling you, i'm betting they got a database

102
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,001
That'll tell us exactly where each key's

103
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,860
Corresponding lock has been installed.

104
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,532
Look at that.

105
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,430
These keys run about 500 bucks each?!

106
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:27,262
You only spend that kind of money if you're

107
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,760
Protecting something of vital importance.

108
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,263
Like scylla.

109
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,463
Someone just tried to access

110
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,161
Carruth's account at hold-secure.

111
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,661
And what information was compromised?

112
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,002
We don't know yet.

113
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,632
And who was trying to access it?

114
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,001
We don't know.

115
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:52,660
Thank you for bringing that to my attention. good work.

116
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:56,962
Yes?

117
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,501
It's your son.

118
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:01,660
We already have safeguards in place to deal with lincoln.

119
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,031
I'm talking about michael.

120
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:06,000
He's escaped company custody.

121
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,630
He's coming to miami right now.

122
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,733
Christina?

123
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:17,333
If only they understood what it is i'm trying to do.

124
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,202
Thank you very much.

125
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,860
Thanks.

126
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,403
Okay, what now?

127
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,462
We'll think of something.

128
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,103
Michael, we can't afford to buy a car

129
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,631
And we can't fly.

130
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,832
It's time to call your brother.

131
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:50,662
Got it.

132
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,803
We've got the locations of those two locks.

133
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,032
One's in little havana.

134
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,500
The other one's down by the water.

135
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,263
Perfect. lincoln, why don't you and i...

136
00:06:57,265 --> 00:06:59,662
You take self and go to little havana.

137
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:00,933
We're gonna head south.

138
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,202
Huh, that's a surprise.

139
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,000
We need suntan lotion.

140
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,033
Be right there.

141
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,430
It's me.

142
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:14,703
What's your problem?

143
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:16,730
Look, i need you to hear me out on this, linc.

144
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,605
Everything was all set up and you blew it.

145
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,737
You couldn't just let me handle this, could you?

146
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,133
If by "handle," you mean give scylla back to the general,

147
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,902
Then no, i couldn't.

148
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,862
It's more complicated than that.

149
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,160
Actually, it's not.

150
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,232
Listen to me,

151
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:30,460
I want my life back

152
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,200
And this is the only way we can do that!

153
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,863
I don't believe that's true.

154
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,102
You know what, man?

155
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:36,360
You need to grow up.

156
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:39,132
Look, if that's how you really feel, linc,

157
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:41,600
I should warn you i'm going to do everything in my power

158
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,231
To stop you.

159
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,562
I had a deal with the general.

160
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,260
You blew it.

161
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,600
He finds you, he's gonna kill you.

162
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,461
Surprise, surprise.

163
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,631
I did this for us, michael.

164
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:55,160
You, me, sara,

165
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,630
Lj, so you could be with sara.

166
00:07:57,635 --> 00:07:59,803
Two seconds, just think of your family.

167
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,101
Feels like family's the only thing

168
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,302
I can think about these days.

169
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:04,930
What does that mean?

170
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:06,160
Michael?

171
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:09,730
Linc, mom is alive.

172
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:13,903
What?

173
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:16,332
Guess i'll see you in miami.

174
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,400
We gotta get out of here.

175
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:22,300
Sir, you mind if i ask where you're going?

176
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,461
Dallas.

177
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,032
Mind if we hitch a ride?

178
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,501
I got 100 bucks; gas money.

179
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,800
Please?

180
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,233
Sir?

181
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:40,033
Cab's not big enough for the two of you.

182
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:41,162
If you want to ride together

183
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:43,161
You're going to have to ride back here.

184
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:45,802
Done.

185
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,660
Get comfortable.

186
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,333
Gonna be eight hours till we stop again.

187
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,862
Linc...

188
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,032
If scylla really is in there, there's gonna be security.

189
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,462
I need you focused.

190
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,201
Yeah.

191
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,263
All Clear upstairs.

192
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,160
You find something?

193
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:44,103
Picture of my mom.

194
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:45,861
Someone must have known i was coming.

195
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:51,533
Someone who's connected enough to be working with carruth

196
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:52,931
And who knows you well enough

197
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:55,033
To get their hands on that picture.

198
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:57,003
There's only one person i can think of

199
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,802
That fits that description.

200
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,500
You're saying my mom's in miami?

201
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,901
If she was operating out of this house,

202
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,402
She certainly had access to money.

203
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:05,402
She's a company agent.

204
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:06,762
Gretchen said she thought

205
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:09,503
That this could be an inside job.

206
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:11,160
Linc...

207
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,762
Your mother could have scylla.

208
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:21,062
She used to bake cookies when we'd come home

209
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:23,530
From school,

210
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:26,762
Play kickball with us in the backyard.

211
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:29,503
There's just no way that woman was a company agent.

212
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,130
You did read her file, didn't you?

213
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,302
I saw medical reports

214
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:39,930
That said she had the same diagnosis i did

215
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:42,061
And that company doctors operated

216
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,002
On her, too.

217
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,561
Now i'm wondering if they took her off

218
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:50,401
To a log cabin in the woods after they were done,

219
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,901
Introduced her to a friendly shrink.

220
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,462
How else could someone just stand by and watch

221
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,431
Their own children were hunted down like dogs?

222
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:05,431
Maybe she didn't know.

223
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,602
She knew.

224
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:12,732
Maybe it was over her head.

225
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:15,003
Or maybe she didn't care.

226
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:18,533
Anyway, i'm just surprised

227
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,601
The general waited so long to drop this bomb on us.

228
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,602
Actually, i think that part makes sense.

229
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:26,460
I mean, for whatever reason,

230
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,531
Your mother didn't want you to know she was alive

231
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:30,931
Or you would have known years ago.

232
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:33,963
The general was just keeping that secret, right?

233
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:37,201
Keeping her happy, keeping her working.

234
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,861
But now the game has changed.

235
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:43,862
Yeah, now he thinks you might be useful.

236
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,061
Just like mom.

237
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:52,330
Beyond question, he possesses the most gifted mind

238
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,760
Of any man i've ever encountered.

239
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:56,661
Well, i'll try not to take that too personally.

240
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,803
He drilled into your office safe

241
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:05,660
And copied your card without you even noticing.

242
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,861
As I recall, you were sitting right next to me.

243
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:12,233
If we could have turned Michael Scofield,

244
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:14,832
It would have been like having 30 more years of Christina.

245
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:18,002
Pull over.

246
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:25,101
That's my ride.

247
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,703
What's going on?

248
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,501
Good-bye, Jonathan.

249
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:11,831
This isn't the place.

250
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,032
I could pick that lock with my stump.

251
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,233
No, n-no, n-no.

252
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:18,632
Remember what they say about books and their covers.

253
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,432
When Harry Winston donated the hope diamond

254
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:22,800
To the smithsonian, you know how he got it from new york

255
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:24,733
To dc?

256
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:26,561
Registered mail.

257
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,260
It's the safest way to go.

258
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,062
After all, who is going to be looking

259
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:33,261
For the hope diamond at the post office, right?

260
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:35,630
And who would be looking for scylla

261
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,232
At some run-down storefront church

262
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,360
In little havana?

263
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,460
They got scylla back there somewhere.

264
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:44,063
You walk in there, reeking that cop stink,

265
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,360
You won't last a second.

266
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:48,232
That's a good point.

267
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,600
That's why you're going in.

268
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,562
May i help you?

269
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,330
Yes, as a matter of fact.

270
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:11,300
I'm Charles Patoshik.

271
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:13,562
I'm a professor of anthropology

272
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,430
At southern florida university.

273
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:18,202
I'm doing some various research on various different kinds

274
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,302
Of, uh, uh, uh, caribbean religions, and, uh...

275
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:22,563
Perhaps you could start

276
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:26,133
Back there where you, you do your, uh, services.

277
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,432
That is our sanctuary.

278
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,163
Only the pure of soul

279
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,901
May venture inside.

280
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:33,903
I know.

281
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:36,332
I-i have been in many such rooms.

282
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,531
Let me see your hand.

283
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:54,663
Your soul is black,

284
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:58,261
Stained with the blood of the innocent.

285
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,103
I cannot let you pass.

286
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:04,630
I have never been so offended in my life.

287
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:12,731
I suggest that you continue your research

288
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,632
Elsewhere.

289
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:26,301
If you drop something

290
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:29,031
By accident,

291
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,002
You leave a fingerprint on it.

292
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,132
She wanted you to find this.

293
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,031
Why? you ever seen it before?

294
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,861
No.

295
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:38,862
Do you remember

296
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,060
Anything about that day?

297
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,131
I was four years old.

298
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,503
Any idea where it was taken?

299
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:47,102
No.

300
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:52,500
You okay?

301
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,603
I mean, if i found out my mom was... listen,

302
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:56,333
As far as i'm concerned, she's not my mom.

303
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:57,702
She's just someone in the way of my freedom.

304
00:16:57,705 --> 00:16:58,661
All right?

305
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,762
So, on my sixth birthday,

306
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:13,800
Um, my father was long gone by then,

307
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:16,100
So it was just me, mom, and linc, and...

308
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:17,760
Mom hands me my present--

309
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,801
My, uh, my only present-- and i just know...

310
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:24,430
I just know it's the millennium falcon.

311
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:26,101
With the battle alert sound?

312
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:27,203
Exactly.

313
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,200
-I totally owned that. -of course you did.

314
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,602
Anyway, i had been asking for this thing for weeks,

315
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:33,763
And the package is just the right size, and...

316
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,201
I rip open the wrapping paper

317
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:38,962
And... it's a birdhouse.

318
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,230
Oh, no.

319
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:42,903
Oh, yeah, except it's not even a birdhouse.

320
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:44,763
It's actually a birdhouse kit.

321
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:46,901
I'm so sorry.

322
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:50,663
I didn't talk to her for two days after that,

323
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:53,831
But when she finally got me to open the thing,

324
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,260
We sat there together,

325
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,200
Put it together piece by piece,

326
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:59,062
And it was the first thing i ever built.

327
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:04,462
And i loved it...

328
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,802
And she knew i would.

329
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:09,163
She knew me better than i knew myself.

330
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,102
That's what moms do.

331
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:13,801
Yeah, but the strange thing is...

332
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,663
Even though i haven't seen her for 23 years,

333
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,731
There's this part of me

334
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:21,161
That feels like maybe she still does.

335
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,733
Your truck looks a little low to the ground.

336
00:18:58,738 --> 00:18:59,731
You mind stepping outside?

337
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:01,833
I just got weighed 20 miles back.

338
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,262
You highway patrol?

339
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,601
Where are you going?

340
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,862
You've got no business in there.

341
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,001
Unless you show me a warrant,

342
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,001
You get the hell out of there right now.

343
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:38,260
Thank you.

344
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:43,902
Goodness.

345
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:45,931
I got my weigh station ticket

346
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,600
Right here on the dash.

347
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:49,261
As soon as you see that...

348
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,260
You'll see i got it right here.

349
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,160
Here you go.

350
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,602
I need you to follow me back to phoenix.

351
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,161
Are you crazy?

352
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,801
I got to get this load to dallas.

353
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,932
Well, that's your choice.

354
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:23,461
I got 'em.

355
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:33,460
I think we need to call your brother.

356
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,232
No signal.

357
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:36,862
We must be in the middle of nowhere.

358
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:39,620
Lincoln said that if the company caught you...

359
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,500
I think i saw a side door back here.

360
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,503
What about the main door?

361
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:48,761
You'll never get that open.

362
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,660
I'm sure it's latched from the outside.

363
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,190
Can you open the side door?

364
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:54,703
Maybe.

365
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:02,901
Sara.

366
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:03,903
Help me out.

367
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:11,962
I don't think we're going to be able to move this.

368
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:19,091
Maybe we won't have to.

369
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:22,030
I have troubling news about general krantz.

370
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:23,431
He's alive.

371
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:25,333
I don't see how that's possible.

372
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,933
Yes, well, what i'm hearing is a

373
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,533
helicopter with

374
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,333
From company headquarters in los angeles one hour ago.

375
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,533
It landed for two minutes in canyon country

376
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,800
And now it's back in los angeles.

377
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,132
So you got the corpse?

378
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:41,162
The helicopter landed back at company headquarters.

379
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:43,403
You know how important getting rid of him is

380
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:45,263
To what we're trying to accomplish.

381
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:47,562
All right, I can still get this done.

382
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,861
Not in our time frame.

383
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,002
All right, I'm pulling the plug.

384
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:58,361
We need to start dealing with the consequences.

385
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,100
Wait, wait, wait. first things first.

386
00:22:00,105 --> 00:22:01,502
He knows that i've betrayed him.

387
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:02,600
I need to disappear.

388
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:04,801
I think that's a good instinct.

389
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:06,860
I have a house in Sun Valley.

390
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,263
I have another idea.

391
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:11,603
Do you mind putting me on speaker?

392
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,902
You know, Griff, you're a brave man.

393
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:19,703
And I thank you for everything you've done.

394
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,663
It's been an honor.

395
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,230
Now.

396
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:25,331
"Now" what?

397
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:32,062
The car in this picture has Florida plates.

398
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:33,460
Did you ever vacation there?

399
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:35,163
- No. - Do you know anyone

400
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,433
- From Forida who came up to visit? - No.

401
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:40,530
Why did they take this picture in front of that car?

402
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:45,903
We didn't.

403
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:47,303
It's been doctored.

404
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:48,503
I'm not sure about that.

405
00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:50,630
I mean, the lighting, the shadows,

406
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:51,961
All sync up perfectly.

407
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,502
This is a '78 zephyr.

408
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,862
Michael was born in '76.

409
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:01,602
You're the only one who could've picked up on that.

410
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,501
She doctored that for you.

411
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,301
Let's see what else she might've changed.

412
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:07,260
What's the license plate on that zephyr?

413
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:11,102
M-I-K 4-4-1.

414
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,762
Martin Luther King boulevard intersects with route 441

415
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:15,263
About five miles north of here.

416
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:16,601
Good.

417
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,601
You guys are here. listen, we're a little outmanned

418
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,462
Down in Little Havana. we could use some backup.

419
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,400
We got a lead on the buyer.

420
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:24,130
Great, what are we waiting for?

421
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:25,951
I think I gonna do it myself.

422
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:28,301
Come on, let's stay together. we're a team, right?

423
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,330
- I said i got it. - After our little

424
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,862
Special deliveries this morning,

425
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,361
Each one of us has an equal stake.

426
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:35,903
Whoever started this, we're all going to take them out.

427
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:42,232
The buyer, we think it's Lincoln's mother.

428
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:43,660
What?

429
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,401
Like i said, i'm doing this myself.

430
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:47,660
Linc!

431
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:49,530
If she has scylla,

432
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:51,162
She's not just going to hand it over

433
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,001
Any more than the general would have.

434
00:23:53,008 --> 00:23:54,203
You don't know that.

435
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:55,902
We always thought whoever had scylla

436
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,261
Would do what the general did.

437
00:23:57,265 --> 00:23:58,663
Maybe she won't.

438
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,762
Are you serious?

439
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:01,601
Your mother is a company agent?

440
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,030
She was.

441
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:04,400
She might be one of the good guys now.

442
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:05,762
With all due respect,

443
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,403
I don't think you're in a place where you can make

444
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,032
A clear determination about that.

445
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:12,160
Listen, this MLK 441 could be nothing.

446
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,232
But at the church,

447
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:14,332
There could be scylla.

448
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:17,463
If i need you, i'll call.

449
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,503
This should work.

450
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,562
Christina?

451
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,192
You need to acknowledge that our chance

452
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,863
Of success has substantially declined in the last 24 hours.

453
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,561
There are people out looking for us.

454
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,762
We need to start thinking in terms of contingencies.

455
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:59,562
Just a little while longer, only a few more days.

456
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,432
General Krantz refused to adjust

457
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:03,092
When there were credible threats against him.

458
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:05,090
That's the reason we have scylla now.

459
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:10,060
Are you honestly comparing me to him?

460
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:16,060
I understand what you think your role is in all of this,

461
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:17,701
And I appreciate your efforts.

462
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,161
But if you can't tell the difference

463
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,161
Between he and I, perhaps you need to ask

464
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,531
The general for your old job back.

465
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,563
Oh, look.

466
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,933
Here he is. would you like to take the call?

467
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:38,060
Jonathan.

468
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,661
Good afternoon, Christina.

469
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,033
It's good to hear your voice.

470
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,462
I assume this means you've retrieved scylla.

471
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:44,631
Not yet.

472
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:46,560
Oh, troubling news.

473
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:48,403
Have any idea where it is?

474
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:50,031
Where are you, Christina?

475
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,932
Johannesburg. where else would I be?

476
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:54,532
I've had some of my contacts

477
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:56,300
In your area check on your house.

478
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:57,762
There's no one home.

479
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,962
Well, of course not. as long as scylla's in play,

480
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:02,030
That address is blown.

481
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:06,501
Where are you, Christina?

482
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:08,700
I don't like your tone, jonathan.

483
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:09,900
Excuse me

484
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:12,431
If I sound a bit abrasive.

485
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,602
But it's been a while since anyone's tried to kill me.

486
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,460
Oh, my god.

487
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,192
Are you all right? what happened?

488
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,192
Oren.

489
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:22,762
"Oren"?

490
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:25,762
We found his body... executed.

491
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:28,833
I can only assume that he's working with someone.

492
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:30,730
Someone who doesn't tolerate failure.

493
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:33,001
Now, where are you, Christina?

494
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:34,933
You listen to me.

495
00:26:34,937 --> 00:26:37,833
If you're implying that I had anything to do with this...

496
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:40,031
Where are you?

497
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:44,033
After everything i've given to the compeny. My husband, my children...

498
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:46,690
I think it's time that we had a sit-down.

499
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,903
- And talk. - Tell you what.

500
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,461
Why don't you gether up the brain trust,

501
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:55,133
That half-witted daughter and your psychotic mistress?

502
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:58,003
Why don't you get together and figure out where scylla is?

503
00:26:58,005 --> 00:26:59,233
Then call me.

504
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:30,431
Mr. Burrows.

505
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:40,163
May I escort you to your table?

506
00:28:06,105 --> 00:28:07,902
You haven't changed a bit.

507
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,832
I'm glad you got my message.

508
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:19,863
I know it wasn't the most straightforward

509
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,332
Mode of communication, but I had to be sure it was you.

510
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:25,300
At least now I know where Michael gets it from.

511
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:32,061
I'm sure you have many questions.

512
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:34,002
Where's scylla?

513
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:35,933
It's safe.

514
00:28:35,938 --> 00:28:37,833
That's all I can tell you for right now.

515
00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:39,631
Then we've got nothing to talk about.

516
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:41,401
Really?

517
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:43,203
That's the only reason you came here?

518
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:45,832
Yeah.

519
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,663
I really would've thought you wanted to know the truth.

520
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,401
I know the truth.

521
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:51,833
You work for the company.

522
00:28:51,838 --> 00:28:54,100
The same people that set me up for murder.

523
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,360
- Lincoln... - The same people

524
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,401
That have been trying to kill me and Michael

525
00:28:57,406 --> 00:28:59,733
Ever since we escaped Fox River.

526
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:04,200
You can think it as much as you want, I'm not a monster.

527
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:11,231
23 years and not even an apology?

528
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:14,403
If I thought an apology would do any good,

529
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:15,832
I would offer it.

530
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:22,930
Please.

531
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:24,902
Please sit down.

532
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:38,062
Leaving you two boys...

533
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,633
Was the hardest thing I ever did.

534
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,661
But you did.

535
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,733
And then you went off and worked for the company.

536
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,832
You know, you think you know what the company is,

537
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:49,901
But you don't.

538
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:54,162
It is a body that bends to the will of its head.

539
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:57,963
And right now, it is bloodthirsty and war-hungry,

540
00:29:57,966 --> 00:30:00,603
Because that's who General Krantz is.

541
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,633
But what if a woman,

542
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,361
A mother, ran it?

543
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,830
Can you imagine the different that would make?

544
00:30:09,835 --> 00:30:11,261
You think you're a mother?

545
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:13,161
A mother's priority

546
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,201
Is her family.

547
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:17,532
If I give scylla back to the general, he leaves me

548
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:19,402
And Michael alone, and I get to spend time

549
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:20,860
With my son in peace.

550
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:25,132
Look, I could sit here for days and try to explain to you

551
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:27,260
Why I did what I did.

552
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:29,463
Suffice it to say, I couldn't protect you then,

553
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:32,402
But let me protect you now.

554
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,330
What if general Krantz were no longer in the picture?

555
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,731
Once he is dealt with,

556
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:43,163
No one would come after you.

557
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:45,031
But I need time, Lincoln.

558
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:46,400
I need two days

559
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:47,963
To put everything into place.

560
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,762
If you give me two days...

561
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:53,661
...then I can give you and Michael

562
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,503
Your complete and utter freedom.

563
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,533
All right.

564
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:10,262
All right.

565
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,760
I'm going to get started right away.

566
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,831
But if Krantz suspects any of this,

567
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,931
He's going to hunt us both down.

568
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:19,831
And for that reason,

569
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,360
I can't risk being seen with you

570
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:24,133
Until all of this is over.

571
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:27,233
How will I get in touch with you?

572
00:31:27,237 --> 00:31:30,002
You can't.

573
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm sorry.

574
00:31:57,368 --> 00:31:59,161
Once we pull this box down,

575
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,363
It'll push the water machine

576
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,803
Right through the side door.

577
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:03,600
We're slowing down. I think we're getting off the highway.

578
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:05,262
I'm almost ready.

579
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,631
Sara, grab that strap over there.

580
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:19,160
All right, hold it.

581
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:29,733
Come on!

582
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,503
You all right?

583
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:10,001
After you clear the area

584
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:11,362
I don't anticipate any problems.

585
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,363
All right?

586
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,502
Scylla or not here we come.

587
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:15,530
All right. hold on.

588
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:23,192
What the hell are those guys doing?

589
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,763
We're not going against any additional people in there.

590
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,190
- We wait until they come back out. - All right.

591
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:36,561
So Lincoln's mother is really the buyer?

592
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,700
It appears that way.

593
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:40,962
I hope he understands,

594
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:43,961
That if I need to take her out to get to scylla,

595
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,962
I'm not going to hesitate to kill her.

596
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,463
No question.

597
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:49,432
Well, let's just hope it doesn't come to that.

598
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:51,661
You serious?

599
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,531
Yeah. am I serious if we can get scylla

600
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:54,703
Without killing Linc's mother,

601
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:56,501
That's the preferable outcome.

602
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:57,801
Wait a second.

603
00:33:57,808 --> 00:33:59,600
If I'm gonna be in the foxhole with you,

604
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:01,602
I need to know that you have my back.

605
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:08,660
Mrs. Burrows has the item,

606
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:10,103
And the only way to get it is to kill her.

607
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:12,103
What is your move?

608
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:17,731
I pull the trigger.

609
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:26,501
There they go, Come on.

610
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:37,902
Don self,

611
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:40,302
Homeland Security.

612
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,963
We're investigating

613
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,733
A cruelty to animal charge.

614
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:47,560
I have no idea what you're referring to.

615
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:49,903
We're referring to ritual Slaughters of chickens.

616
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:51,560
Okay, that might be allowed where you come from

617
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,002
But here in America, that's no mas.

618
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:56,661
Chickens? This is preposterous.

619
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:58,262
This is because I'm Caribbean.

620
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:00,263
I swear to god, I smelled chicken blood.

621
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,331
Worse than the place

622
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,703
Down the street we shut down.

623
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,232
You want to turn this into something?

624
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,860
Sit down.

625
00:35:06,866 --> 00:35:08,863
If there aren't any chickens,

626
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:09,900
There aren't any chickens.

627
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:11,003
But we're not going to know that

628
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,200
Until we take a look around.

629
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:14,002
The smell was coming from back there.

630
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:16,903
That is our sanctuary.

631
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,162
I cannot let you to disrupt it.

632
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:22,230
I understand your concerns, but I need to go back there.

633
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:24,001
I insist, you cannot do that.

634
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:26,102
Best I can do is have you accompany us, please.

635
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:28,102
Please.

636
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:30,201
You,

637
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:31,531
Come on, let's go outside

638
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:32,530
Until they're done.

639
00:35:32,536 --> 00:35:33,502
Let's go.

640
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:47,261
That's not a very heavenly thing to do.

641
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:16,631
Find anything?

642
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:17,931
Oh, yeah.

643
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:26,763
What the hell are they up to?

644
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,462
I don't know.

645
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,562
He just asked to rent that closet.

646
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,262
Did a woman ever come down here with him?

647
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:34,132
Yeah, once.

648
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,460
I'm telling you,

649
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:36,802
That's all I know.

650
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,763
Drop it.

651
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,432
Don't.

652
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:51,101
Come here. Both of you,

653
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:54,992
On your knees.

654
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:56,432
I said on your knees.

655
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:03,403
I told you not to come in here.

656
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,530
Where's the other guy?

657
00:37:12,537 --> 00:37:14,033
He ran. Let's go.

658
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:15,732
Let's go.

659
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:24,193
Are you all right?

660
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:25,401
Yeah.

661
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,561
Let's go.

662
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:01,082
Come on.

663
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:38,632
We're not going to make it back to the truck.

664
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:40,062
I know.

665
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:42,102
Here.

666
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:43,061
Take this.

667
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,301
I'll be right back.

668
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:47,161
Michael!

669
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:37,361
You all right?

670
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:38,462
Yeah, thanks.

671
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,231
The general should know by now not to mess with us.

672
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:12,162
The general...

673
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:14,662
Didn't send me.

674
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:19,730
Who did?

675
00:40:19,737 --> 00:40:21,733
Who sent you?

676
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:48,962
Lincoln!

677
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,430
We've got news.

678
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:51,601
So do I.

679
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:53,130
We're staying low for two days.

680
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:55,631
Christina's promised to get rid of Krantz.

681
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:56,900
I think she's lying.

682
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:58,900
I know it sounds crazy,

683
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:00,730
She said she's going to change the company

684
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:01,932
In the way it operates.

685
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:04,430
So what, the company's gonna go nonviolent now?

686
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:06,731
- Just hear me out. - I'm telling you. I think she's lying.

687
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:08,300
It's from the church. Some kind of credential.

688
00:41:08,306 --> 00:41:10,361
There were some automatic weapons in there, too.

689
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:12,962
And trust me, if there's fake IDs and weapons

690
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:14,333
Something big's about to go down.

691
00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:15,802
Your mom,

692
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,132
She said after two days,

693
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:18,500
That's when she would make the change.

694
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:19,602
Yeah.

695
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:21,103
Take a look at the date on that laminate,

696
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,861
Two days away.

697
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,502
- You think that's just a coincidence?  - Come on,

698
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:25,732
Lincoln, you can't be surprised

699
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:27,401
That a woman that would abandon her kids

700
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:28,763
Would be less than truthful

701
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,462
About her intentions right now.

702
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:32,432
- Hey, where you going? - I need to talk to her.

703
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:34,130
Just take a moment. Let's figure this out.

704
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:35,761
If she's looking to head the company,

705
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:38,832
There has to a more realistic plan than a one-man

706
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:39,901
Frontal assault.

707
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:40,933
She'll listen to me.

708
00:41:40,937 --> 00:41:42,432
She asked you not to come back, Linc.

709
00:41:42,437 --> 00:41:43,431
That's a warning.

710
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,630
Lincoln's back at the plaza.

711
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:25,660
I think we need

712
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,100
To realize he's more of a threat

713
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:28,360
Than we gave him credit for.

714
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:29,763
He found the mansion.

715
00:42:29,768 --> 00:42:31,501
His guys got the stash at the church.

716
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:32,733
He's not going to stop.

717
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:35,730
I told him to stay away.

718
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:45,861
Sir,

719
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:47,962
Alpha is a go.

720
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,201
Christina,

721
00:42:49,206 --> 00:42:51,163
We have a clean shot.

722
00:43:02,507 --> 00:43:04,532
Take it.

723
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:05,562
Take it.
