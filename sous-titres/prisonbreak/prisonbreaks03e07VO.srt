1
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,900
Explain something to me, blanco,

2
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,140
One minute you plead for your friend's life,

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,190
and the next minute you nt to take it.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,020
This man...

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,860
this man is no friend of mine!

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,840
What happened to your girlfriend has nothing...

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,940
Her name was Sara!

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,400
And she was a good person.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,990
And she'd still be alive

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,150
if it wasn't for you.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,760
So it's revenge, eh, b?

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,360
An eye for an eye?

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,670
Once you make such a declaration there's no going back.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,210
There's nothing to go back to.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,400
Good.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,230
Then we have a fight.

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,390
Now, both of you,

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,910
go and assign your belongings,

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,510
and pray to whatever god is yours.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,930
Come back here in 15 minutes.

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,620
Fight, fight, fight, fight...

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:17,480
fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight fight...

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,280
You need anymore help?

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,770
You've done more than enough.

25
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,270
Here, take that, man.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not a lot, but it's enough to get you started.

27
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,490
Oh, no, no, I can't take this.

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,350
I did this because I wanted to help you guys.

29
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,810
Hey, buy a car, get a bus ticket,

30
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,190
do whatever, just get out of here.

31
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,590
Thanks.

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,240
I'm going to get so gas, okay?

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,320
I'll meet you in the front.

34
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,930
All right.

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,870
Good luck.

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,940
You too.

37
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,920
Is she coming with you to do the exchange?

38
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,390
Yeah.

39
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,320
You think that's a good idea?

40
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,800
I mean, what if something goes wrong

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,300
and she gets hurt? I need some incentive

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,980
just in case Whistler doesn't want to go quietly.

43
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,240
You think any of this is going to go down quiet?

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,540
They're just going to give you LJ

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,470
just like that? Doesn't matter what I think.

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,010
I know what these people are capable of.

47
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,610
I'm not going to gamble with my son's life.

48
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,100
Maybe you don't have to.

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,740
Alex.

50
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,110
Alex.

51
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,330
Yeah.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,590
We'll be arriving at the courthouse in about 15 minutes.

53
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,150
Then the hearing will begin shortly.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,680
All and all this whole thing will be done within the hour.

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,060
Good.

56
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,130
That sounds good.

57
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,230
So with this deal...

58
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,800
what specifically are they expecting from me?

59
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,280
They need to knoeverything.

60
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,550
About the President, about the company.

61
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,780
They want to confirm that you have

62
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,970
viable incriminating information

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,720
and that you can be a cooperative witness.

64
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,640
If I cooperate fully...

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,370
I won't just be incriminating them.

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,800
You're worried about all those skeletons in your closet,

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
but you have full immunity.

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,550
Everything will be fine.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,050
All you have to do is tell the truth.

70
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,690
Stay calm.

71
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,250
Better knuckle up.

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,310
Look, I don't know what you're thinking,

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,890
but killing me is not

74
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,300
going to solve your problem. Relax.

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,090
I'm not going to kill you.

76
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,520
Then what the hell was all that about?!

77
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,200
You want to make it out of here without being seen,

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,800
you need a diversion. Now we have one.

79
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,700
You're off your head. Do you know that? They're waiting...

80
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,510
We don't have time for this. It's almost 3:00,

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,680
and that means the tower guard should be drugged by now.

82
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,280
At 3:13, the sun's going to hit the other guard tower.

83
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,700
We'll have the cover we need. It's now or never.

84
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,150
Listen, Michael, I, uh...

85
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,020
I meant what I said about Sara.

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,900
If I were you I wouldn'tention that name again.

87
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,990
We're getting out of here now, and then I'm trading you for my nephew.

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,880
And then I'm going to find out

89
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,790
who's responsible for taking her life...

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,100
and I'm taking theirs.

91
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,150
Listen, Scofield... Not now.

92
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,490
I just... please.

93
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,840
I heard you out there in the yard.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,530
Is that true

95
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,830
about Sara?

96
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,190
Yes.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,050
That's not... I mean it's...

98
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:31,940
What'd she...?

99
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,180
I'm sorry, Michael.

100
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:35,700
I mean it.

101
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,150
She was a good person.

102
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,790
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,760
Is something wrong?

104
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,920
If anyone asks,

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,400
just tell them your fuel pump's leaking, all right?

106
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,360
No, no, no, I'm going to the beach with you.

107
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,770
No. I need you to keep a lookout.

108
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,220
When they get here I'll call you, all right?

109
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,130
If everything works out today,

110
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,000
you and me-- we're both going to get what we want.

111
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,740
Stay here.

112
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,360
Sorry about that.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,140
That's okay.

114
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,570
I know you're just doing your job.

115
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,580
I bet you're as ready

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,830
for this t over with as I am.

117
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,020
Hey, you know, once we get out of Panama,

118
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,860
me and my dad and my uncle

119
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,610
we're going to open up a scuba shop somewhere.

120
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,300
Build a house on the beach... Lovely.

121
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,280
go swimming every day.

122
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,220
I never lived by the ocean... You can stop.

123
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,600
I always wanted to, you know?

124
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,220
I get it.

125
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,740
You're a human being

126
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,800
wi dreams, plans for the future, all that.

127
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,070
Whether you see it isn't up to me anymore.

128
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,680
It's in your uncle's hands now.

129
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,350
So let's just hope that he does his job.

130
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,990
What are you waiting for?

131
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,140
Where's Mahone?

132
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,640
He's gone.

133
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,060
What, just like that?

134
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,160
Why? I mean, how?

135
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,100
How about we worry a little bit more about us, huh?

136
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,300
You know, he got out of here kind of suddenly.

137
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,710
How do we know he's not ratting us out right now?

138
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,080
Sullins.

140
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,140
When did this happen?

141
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,370
Are you sure? Yeah.

142
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,170
I'll handle it.

143
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,080
Something wrong?

144
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,920
A couple of the Panamanians might have gotten cold feet.

145
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,760
Exactly how cold?

146
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,420
They just need some convincing.

147
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,250
It's nothing to worry about.

148
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,730
It's all gonna work out.

149
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,460
Meantime, we're gonna take you to a hotel room.

150
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,360
Up until an hour ago,

151
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,470
this was a done deal.

152
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,380
So... what's happening?

153
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,660
Relax. This is still your best bet.

154
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,900
Unless someone's offering you

155
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,100
a "get out of Sona free" card.

156
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,840
Now, remember, we'll only have four minutes of cover,

157
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,080
so once you hit the ground you run straight to the fence.

158
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,000
Don't look up, don't look back,

159
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,080
don't say a word.

160
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,320
What if they see us?

161
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,610
If someone yells stop,

162
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,530
you stop.

163
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,420
That's it?

164
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,040
That's it.

165
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,680
It's time.

166
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,480
Where's Sammy?

167
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
I dont know, Patron

168
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,760
So, who goes first?

169
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,670
Right now my life isn't worth a damn without yours.

170
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,760
If this doesn't go as planned, the first guy

171
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,010
through that window's gonna get shot.

172
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,340
That guy can't be you.

173
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:56,730
I'll go.

174
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:57,730
I got it.

175
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,740
Come on, come on, come on.

176
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,700
This is it.

177
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,810
Five...

178
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,860
four...

179
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,740
three...

180
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,930
two... one.

181
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,120
The glare.

182
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,080
Where's the glare? I don't know.

183
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,550
Come on

184
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:03,980
This is it.

185
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,780
Someone's coming.

186
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,670
Good luck.

187
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,550
You, too.

188
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,110
We're losing the light.

189
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,740
Go back.  Go back!

190
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,900
Go back!

191
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,700
Come on! Come on!

192
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
That was our only chance.

193
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Damn it!

194
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Find out where they are.

195
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,100
Do you hear 'em out there? They're waiting for us.

196
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,700
It's only a matter of time. I know. Come on.

197
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,900
The damn thing's not coming off!

198
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,700
Hey, gringos!

199
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,200
Come out and play.

200
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Come on! Come on!

201
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Nowhere to hide, malditos!

202
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,200
Gringos!

203
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,800
Come out and play!

204
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,400
We've got to go. They can't find us here.

205
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,500
But what about this?

206
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,300
Stash it!

207
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,300
Come on!

208
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,100
Come on!

209
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
. Go.

210
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
Where are you off to, Backra?

211
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,800
Where you boys been?

212
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,500
The bathroom?

213
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,100
This has all been

214
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
a terrible mistake.

215
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,200
Has it been?

216
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,900
We've, uh, we've worked it out.

217
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,700
There's no need to take this any further.

218
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
You clearly don't understand

219
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
I can't have your foolishness spread in this place.

220
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,100
I gave you every chance to pull out.

221
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,100
Please.

222
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,400
We know the rules!

223
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,400
Two men go in,

224
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
one man comes out!

225
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,200
Now,

226
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,700
this quarrel must be settled.

227
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,300
Let's go.

228
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

229
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
What are you gentlemen waiting for?

230
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
You two don't make this more interesting, I will.

231
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Sorry, mate-- if only one of us is getting out...

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,800
How's it look?

233
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,500
They got LJ in the back of the van.

234
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,600
He seem all right to you? Yeah, I think so.

235
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
All right, how many people they got?

236
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,000
She's got a driver and a bodyguard-- that's it.

237
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,900
All right. You know I appreciate you hanging around, man

238
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,800
Hey, we started this together, bro.

239
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Let's finish it that way.

240
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,700
Come on, Michael.

241
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,500
Where are you?

242
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,500
What you doing here?

243
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
You're supposed to be keeping watch.

244
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
Just checking, making sure everything is all right.

245
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,700
They're running a bit late, that's all.

246
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,900
So, what's the plan?

247
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,800
You gonna swim out, wait for the police to pass, and...

248
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,700
meet with a boat somewhere?

249
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,600
Something like that.

250
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,100
And then what?

251
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
You know what, you need to get back

252
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,200
to the car... Don't move.

253
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,900
I'm impressed.

254
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,600
You've actually got the guts to look me in the eye

255
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,500
as you stab me in the back.

256
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,900
What are you going to do, shoot me?

257
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Don't. I can't let you hand over

258
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,800
James to those people.

259
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You need to think about what you're doing.

260
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,900
I have!

261
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,400
Every since you told me what they did to Sara.

262
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,800
When they get here, James and I, we're leaving.

263
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,900
Where to?

264
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,500
I don't know. Somewhere they won't find us.

265
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,100
So, this whole time, you played me.

266
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,600
Like you've been playing me.

267
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
Bringing me here to be your lookout?

268
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
But it's okay.

269
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
We were both here doing what we had to

270
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,300
for the people we love.

271
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,200
You do this, you may as well be shooting my son yourself.

272
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm sorry.

273
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,900
They should be out by now. Any sign?

274
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,600
All quiet.

275
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
How much longer do youant to give them?

276
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,300
I know you wanted to live

277
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,300
by an ocean your whole life.

278
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,700
Sad to think

279
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,290
the closest you'll get is being buried under one.

280
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,420
You're not gonna kill me.

281
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh? You need me.

282
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,300
You already killed Sara.

283
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Anything happens to me,

284
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,100
you're out of bargaining chips.

285
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,600
If Michael doesn't get Whistler out today,

286
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,600
I won't need to bargain anymore.

287
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,200
You'll all be dead.

288
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,800
Hurtdo?

289
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
Hurtdo?Where you at?

290
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey,Roldan.

291
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Better send someone to check

292
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,600
on Hurtado in Tower One.

293
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
He is not answering his radio

294
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
and I don't have a visual.

295
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Confirmed.

296
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
We'll send a couple men over.

297
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,400
Kick him in the junk, Scofield!

298
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,300
What are you looking for, boy! There are no draws here!

299
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,000
If this isn't finished by one of you,

300
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm coming down to finish both of you.

301
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,800
Hurtdo?

302
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,200
What are you doing over there?

303
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,900
What, are you sleeping on the job?

304
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No, I don't know what happened.

305
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,490
End it.

306
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
God! God forgive me.

307
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,500
They should have been here by now.

308
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,100
Maybe they get out. They should be on their way.

309
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,500
They didn't make it. So what do we do now?

310
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,500
I don't care what you do,

311
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,400
but I'm taking the car.

312
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,700
What?

313
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,000
What the hell's going on?

314
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,600
Put your hands up on your head!

315
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,100
You come down here.

316
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:37,600
Now!

317
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,700
We are going to find out who is behind this.

318
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,500
What?

319
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,600
Were you going to let me know what the hell's going on?

320
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Lincoln?

321
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,300
I'm here.

322
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,800
Good. Where are they?

323
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,300
They're in the car with me.

324
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,600
I heard the alarm.

325
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,600
They were long gone before that thing went off.

326
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,100
Well, if they had such a head start,

327
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
why are you so far behind?

328
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Listen, do you want me to talk to your drive?

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
I want you to put Whistler on the phone.

330
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,100
What?

331
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,200
Put him on.

332
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,900
He's in the trunk.

333
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,700
But, if you feel that strongly about it,

334
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,900
I can pull over and you two can have a Nice little talk.

335
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If we're real lucky, maybe some cops will swing by.

336
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I'm sure they'd like a word, too.

337
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,100
You know what? Just get LJ ready.

338
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,300
Whoever tried to escape assaulted one of my men.

339
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
And, as you know, any attempt on the life

340
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,600
of a Panamanian soldier

341
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
warrants the death penalty.

342
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,800
This attempt was made from cell #212.

343
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,500
And if memory serves,

344
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,900
that cell belongs to members of your crew, no?

345
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,200
You.

346
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,000
You are one of the Milkman's boys.

347
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,000
Is it your cell?

348
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm going to take that as a yes.

349
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,100
I thought we were compadres, you and I.

350
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,000
I let you run your business, have your whores.

351
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
When you asked me for your own per Sona l supply of water

352
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,100
when the lumbing went down, did I not provide it?

353
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,200
When you asked me to get rid

354
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,000
of the phones, make them contraband,

355
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,300
so you could control the trade in here,

356
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,800
did I not comply?

357
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,300
I do all this for you.

358
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,800
And in exchange, you were to do one thing

359
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
for me.

360
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,700
Keep these men in line!

361
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,700
Maybe we just backed the wrong horse.

362
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Perhaps there is another in here better suited for the job.

363
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Good luck, Bredda.

364
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,300
You know none of us tried

365
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,700
to break out of that cell.

366
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,200
I do.

367
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,900
Then you must know there's only one guy here

368
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,100
foolish enough to try.

369
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,000
Nice to see you back in form.

370
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,500
Thanks.

371
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
Any news from Sullins?

372
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,900
He's working on it.

373
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,500
It doesn't matter what people say.

374
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,800
What do they say?

375
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,800
You know people, how they talk. About?

376
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,400
The men, the ones they say you killed.

377
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:57,800
Is it true?

378
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
Because, if it is, you can talk to about it.

379
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,700
Is that a fact?

380
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,800
Yes. You can trust me.

381
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,800
So let me get this straight.

382
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Sullins sends you to be good cop?

383
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,400
That's not what this is.

384
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
There never was a deal, was there?

385
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,500
Sullins just wants me to confess

386
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,100
so hcan bring me up on more charges back in the States.

387
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
The deal is legit.

388
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,000
The hearing was supposed to be

389
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,000
an hour after we left the prison,

390
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
and I'm still waiting.

391
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,900
So why don't you just come clean, Felicia, huh?

392
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
For old times' sake? How about it?

393
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,300
How about you do me the same courtesy, Alex?

394
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,100
I'm not blind. My brother was a user.

395
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I can smell the stuff a mile away.

396
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,900
Don't you accuse me of being the one who's hiding something.

397
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,700
Hey, I just got confirmation from the radio.

398
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
The guards took a head count and they secured the perimeter.

399
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,400
No one made it out of there today.

400
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,600
Sucre, what's going on?

401
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,900
Looks like they're packing up.

402
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,700
Whatever you do

403
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
don't let them take LJ, all right?

404
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,400
Linc? Linc?

405
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,200
Sucre?

406
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Get the hell out of here now.

407
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,100
Look out!

408
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,800
Dad!

409
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,500
Let her go

410
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,300
Drop it or I swear to God I'll put a bullet in her head!

411
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,200
Now you let him go! You let him go now! Dad!

412
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,100
LJ, I'm going to get you out of this, I promise.

413
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,900
You sure you want to make promises to your son you can't keep?

414
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,800
Watch your mouth.

415
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,200
I'll let you in on a little secret.

416
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,000
When you choose

417
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,500
this line of work, you know it's all going to come down

418
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,400
to a moment like this.

419
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,300
So kill me.

420
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,200
Let him go.

421
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,700
Let him go! Kill him.

422
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,500
Kill him.

423
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Dad!

424
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
It doesn't matter what you do to me.

425
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,500
The operation failed.

426
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,100
So put your gun down, Linc.

427
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,800
Kill him.

428
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,500
Dad!

429
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
No!

430
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,700
No

431
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,000
Give me one more shot.

432
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,900
To do what?

433
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
Let me find out what happened in Sona.

434
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,600
Let me talk to Michael.

435
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,800
We can still get Whistler.

436
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,100
We can make this happen.

437
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,700
We can make this happen. We...

438
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,700
We can do this.

439
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,500
Put him in the van.

440
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,000
Sucre!

441
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:39,900
You all right?

442
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,600
What happened?

443
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,300
Body bags.

444
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,700
Look, what happened out there...

445
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,400
Happened out there. It's over.

446
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,100
All right then.

447
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Right, just so you know,

448
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,500
I wouldn't have gone through with it.

449
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,200
Lucky for us, we'll never have to find out.

450
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,400
So what do we do now?

451
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,400
You know where are you, boy?

452
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,400
Well, I'm no doctor, You but I'm just guessingboy.

453
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
your mother had a little bit too much to drink one night

454
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,200
Keep talking

455
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,800
and you're going to be next.

456
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,300
How you want it, brother?

457
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,800
Fast or slow?

458
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,000
ke to handle this one myself.

459
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,100
Do you have children, Mr. Scofield?

460
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,200
Maybe someday.

461
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,200
That's very optimistic for a man in your position.

462
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Myself, I have five.

463
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,100
Three boys, two girls.

464
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,300
Now I used to tell them a story--

465
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,500
I believe in your country

466
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,300
they call it, "The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

467
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,400
You know it?

468
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
Well, then you know the moral of that story

469
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,600
is even when liars tell the truth,

470
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,200
they can never be believed.

471
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,400
But your life's on the line, boy.

472
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,300
Are you trying to break out of this prison, Mr. Scofield?

473
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,300
No.

474
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,900
Are you trying to break out of this prison?

475
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,200
We both know that's not possible.

476
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,600
Answer me! What do you want me to say?

477
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,700
I want you to tell me the truth. I want to hear it.

478
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,200
You want a reason to kill me. No, boy...

479
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,300
I have good reason to kill you.

480
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,400
Because of you, it's no longer possible

481
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,900
for me to effectively govern this prison.

482
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,300
Justified or not,

483
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,500
the men no longer ha faith in me.

484
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
That leaves only one thing for me to do

485
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,800
to guarantee my survival.

486
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,400
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.

487
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And you're taking me with you.

488
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,600
Well, I've got some good news

489
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,500
and I've got some better news.

490
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,000
Let's start with the good.

491
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,300
Panamanians are back on board.

492
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,400
And the better news?

493
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
You're going to get to have

494
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,100
a really Nice sleep on that bed.

495
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,500
I thought that I...

496
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
After the hearing I was going to be on a plane back to the U.S.

497
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
You said...

498
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,300
I did, and you will be,

499
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
but it's just too late to do the hearing now.

500
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,900
We'll get to it first thing tomorrow.

501
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
Tomorrow morning? Sounds about right.

502
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,100
Please... is there something, is there anything

503
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,800
that we can do to help speed things up?

504
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,500
When a genie grants you a wish

505
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,400
you don't really tell him to make it snappy.

506
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
This hearing

507
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
needs to happen today.

508
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,900
The hearing needs... needs to happen right now!

509
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,600
Listen to you.

510
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,500
You know, you are unbelievable.

511
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
I have dropped everything

512
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
to come down her

513
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
and drag your sorry ass

514
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
out of that hellhole... You don't understand.

515
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,700
I've made you a deal. I can't... I can't wait.

516
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,300
I can't wait.

517
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,200
You know, I am so glad

518
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,900
I have made this trip

519
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,200
to help your esteemed colleague.

520
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,100
I am just tickled.

521
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,300
Cuff him.

522
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,800
Is that necessary?

523
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
Cuff him.

524
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,100
I'm sorry.

525
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:19,900
I can't wait.

526
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,700
Hey, have you seen Whistler?

527
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,500
No.

528
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,600
I spent my whole career

529
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,500
trying to keep bad people behind bars.

530
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,900
Like somehow by doing my job

531
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,600
I was making the world a better place.

532
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,500
And then...

533
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,400
then you hear about what happened to someone like Sara.

534
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,100
Damn if it doesn't seem like there's more bad people

535
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,400
out there than in here.

536
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,400
I warned the brothers what would happen if they failed.

537
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,300
If I give them more time now, I may as well hand them

538
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,100
a condom and a cigarette to go with it.

539
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
You know, I came all the way down here.

540
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,000
The least you could do is offer me an opinion.

541
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,400
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.

542
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
And I thought you needed to be out in seven days.

543
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.

544
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Well, it won't be comfortable, but it will be possible.

545
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Oh, well, thank you, James,

546
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,300
but that doesn't exactly ravage me with confidence.

547
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,400
And what would?

548
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,800
Your ass on a plane.

549
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,000
Four more days.

550
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,300
If I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.

551
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,600
Trust me. It'll be fine.

552
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,200
I'll let the brothers know.

553
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,600
Gretchen.

554
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,000
About Sofia...

555
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:58,800
She's fine.

556
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,100
Burrows is taking real good care of her.
