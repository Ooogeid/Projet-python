00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,350
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,920
I need a number
for a Sundown hotel, please.

3
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:06,716
Got one in Gila, New Mexico.

4
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:11,162
6-3. Tomorrow.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,676
- Who is this?
- I think you already know.

6
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,913
<i>If I buried someone in my own backyard,</i>

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,572
<i>I'd think about it all the time.</i>

8
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,211
<i>Let me and my family disappear</i>

9
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:22,126
<i>and in return,
I'll keep your little secret.</i>

10
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:24,260
<i>I know it's not how
you wanted this to play out.</i>

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,220
But sometimes
"things happen that are just...

12
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:27,300
<i>"out of your control."</i>

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>I'll see you soon, Michael.</i>

14
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,294
It just may be sooner than you think.

15
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:31,514
You can't be here!

16
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:33,422
Where's your sister?
I need to see Maricruz.

17
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,735
The wedding's at 2:30.

18
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:38,180
Maricruz, she told him, "no."
Can you believe that?

19
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:39,682
Go on, get your girl.

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,274
L.J!

21
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,874
Both of you face down!

22
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:50,032
- Please...
- Now!

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,439
Suspect in custody.

24
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:54,783
Possible I.D: Lincoln Burrows.

25
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:05,778
You're going to tell me
where you stashed Westmoreland's money,

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,305
or I'm gonna pluck you
like a chicken, stitch-by-stitch.

27
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,620
For a millionaire, you travel light.

28
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,008
What is this?

29
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:53,144
It's for my blood pressure.

30
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:58,968
Looky what I found.

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,654
Guess Ms. Hollander
liked to beat some meat.

32
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,220
Maybe a couple of whacks in the temple

33
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,604
with this will help you remember
where you put the money.

34
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,846
We've been beating his ass all night.
He ain't coming off the goods.

35
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,650
We need to do something different.

36
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:12,767
It don't matter what you do to me.

37
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,955
I ain't talking.

38
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:18,563
Well, I ain't stopping
till I get what I came for.

39
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:20,700
How about we listen to that again?

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,065
Tell me where that money is,
or I'm gonna read it on your tombstone?

41
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,683
Okay...

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,877
Okay. I'm gonna give you a little clue.

43
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,521
It ain't here.

44
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,721
Confirmed, Burrows is in custody.

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,596
Unbelievable.

46
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,280
He made it all the way to Arizona.

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,180
Another day, he would have been gone.

48
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,599
You found Mahone?

49
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,947
No.

50
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:18,381
Keep trying to call,
it goes straight to voicemail.

51
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,140
<i>This is Alexander Mahone.</i>

52
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,886
<i>Please, leave a message.</i>

53
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,336
<i>Mr. Kim.</i>

54
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,771
Mr. Kellerman.

55
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,179
Lincoln Burrows is in custody.

56
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,919
<i>That's the reason I call.</i>

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,354
Who has him?

58
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,094
<i>Wilcox, Arizona P.D.</i>

59
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,149
<i>We need to extricate him, right away.</i>

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,647
Where's Mr. Mahone?

61
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:45,093
I'm getting in touch with him right now,
but I can take care of this one myself.

62
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:47,089
<i>This is why we hired Mr. Mahone.</i>

63
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,425
He's the official face here.

64
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,604
Don't worry. This won't be official,
and there won't be any questions.

65
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,201
<i>Of course, there will.</i>

66
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,402
Just make sure
no one's left to answer them.

67
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,010
My son had nothing to do
with this, please.

68
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,584
A judge will decide that.

69
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,410
You call ahead?
Yeah, Phoenix is sending backup.

70
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,627
I don't think it's one of ours, Jimmy.

71
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,173
What the hell?!

72
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:09,178
Come on!

73
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,084
Run, run!

74
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,036
Come here!

75
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:26,382
- Let go off me!
- Okay, calm down.

76
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:31,790
- You try that again...
- Who are you?!

77
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,095
We're on your side!

78
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,245
We're with your father.

79
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:42,635
Mahone, Lincoln Burrows
has been apprehended.

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,289
- Where?
<i>- Arizona.</i>

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,989
I'm on my way and I need your talents,
on the ground as well.

82
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,333
I'll get there as soon as I can.

83
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,820
I don't think you heard me.

84
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,074
Get to Arizona.

85
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,052
I'm this close to Scofield.

86
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,067
We have a bird in the hand.

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,846
Yeah, well, so might I.

88
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,150
You wanted me to figure out
Scofield's rendezvous with Tancredi?

89
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,263
It's happening today...

90
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,735
And I'm sitting right on top of it.

91
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:26,615
Presync: fisherchen - www. ydy. com
www.sub-way.fr (v 1.00)

92
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,948
2x10 Rendezvous

93
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,416
What are you looking at?

94
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:32,371
- Where are we?
- It doesn't matter.

95
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,306
You're safe here.

96
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:36,675
You can take a seat.

97
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,927
I ain't doing a thing
until I see my dad.

98
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,120
All I can tell you is he's on his way.

99
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,718
His flight lands in an hour.

100
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,181
Why should I trust you, lady?

101
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,906
I don't see you have much of a choice.

102
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,643
I could drop you back off
with the cops if you'd prefer.

103
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,413
You have somewhere else to be?

104
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:00,812
Matter of fact, we do.

105
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,168
We can't let you leave.

106
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,940
And your father was expecting
your brother to be with you.

107
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,226
Do you know where he is?

108
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:08,685
Do you really think
I'm going to answer that?

109
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,229
You need to start cooperating
with us, Lincoln.

110
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,253
We're only trying to help.

111
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:25,041
Michael Scofield,
escaped from Fox River a week ago.

112
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,928
No, never seen him.

113
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:30,981
Well, if you do,
please call me at that number.

114
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,626
Will do.

115
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,261
There's another hotel down the road.

116
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,164
Thanks.

117
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,409
You got a fax.

118
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,586
Could you put it under the door, please?

119
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,699
Thank you.

120
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:42,378
Theresa!

121
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,227
It's Fernando Sucre.

122
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,024
<i>- She's not here.</i>
- Don't hang up!

123
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,540
I'm so sorry. Please.

124
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,604
Just...

125
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:54,318
I just need to know something.

126
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,620
You've got bigger problems
than my sister right now.

127
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,620
No, no. Wait. Please.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,251
I need to talk to her.

129
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,080
- Please.
- <i>You can't.</i>

130
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:04,115
We're leaving this afternoon.

131
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:06,190
- Where're you going?
<i>- Ixtapa, Mexico.</i>

132
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,608
<i>We won't be back for a week.</i>

133
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,445
We're taking the honeymoon
she had planned with Hector.

134
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,757
<i>She's picking me up in a few hours.</i>

135
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:14,599
What time?

136
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:15,956
A little before 2:00.

137
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,449
<i>She have to call me.</i>

138
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,961
Okay. I give you the number.

139
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,655
- Where are you?
- <i>Take this number off the caller I.D.</i>

140
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,203
<i>Please, Theresa,</i>

141
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:26,950
just have her call me, okay?

142
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,211
I'll be right here.

143
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,931
Hello, Sara.

144
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,916
I wasn't sure you'd come.

145
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:30,043
I didn't have a choice.

146
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,474
This isn't going to be easy for you.

147
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,020
You said in your message
that you had a plan to make this right.

148
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,609
I need to know what that is.

149
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,683
Yeah, she checked in last night.

150
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,882
- Was she alone?
- Yeah.

151
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,693
Kelli Foster.

152
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,261
I put her in room nine.

153
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,350
You the guy
that was trying to call this morning?

154
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:07,937
A guy tried to call this morning?

155
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:10,004
Yeah. He was trying to send her a fax.

156
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,631
Did he do it?

157
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,426
Yeah. 20 minutes ago.

158
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,121
Does the fax have memory?

159
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,836
I guess so.

160
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:23,907
Do you know where that is?

161
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,193
It's five minutes away.

162
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,408
Hey, if she comes back,
is there anything you want me to do?

163
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,966
She isn't coming back.

164
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,661
I've arranged for us to get to Panama.

165
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:37,847
We're meeting up
with my brother tomorrow.

166
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,249
Wait. That's your plan?

167
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,590
To run away to Panama with
the two most wanted men in America?

168
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,120
I came here because I thought

169
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:56,037
you were going to have
real answers for me.

170
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,706
This is an answer.

171
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,536
And, right now,
it's the only one we've got.

172
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,015
Running away into the sunset
with the man who lied to me?

173
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,474
Really?

174
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:12,070
I mean, did you know
about the other guys?

175
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,962
Did you know that I would be
putting T-Bag back out on to the street?

176
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,732
I never meant for that to happen.

177
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,406
I was doing what I needed to do.

178
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:22,994
- My brother was going to die.
- Well, my father's dead.

179
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,158
I am sorry about your father.

180
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,026
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

181
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,843
For what I did to you.

182
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,668
I have many,

183
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:54,247
many regrets, but that's the biggest.

184
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,966
It does not help me right now.

185
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,991
I'm sorry for that, too.

186
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,881
I didn't expect you to...

187
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,841
I didn't expect you to forgive me.

188
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,104
But I don't want you, to...

189
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,876
I don't want you to be alone in this.

190
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,556
I don't want to be alone.

191
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:42,648
Let's go.

192
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,181
Get into the car.

193
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,339
You can't get out this way.
Go back is the only way out of here.

194
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,023
That's the way we're going.

195
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,970
Hold on. Just hold on.

196
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,145
- Michael, what are you doing?
- Just hold on!

197
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:19,703
Come on!

198
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,270
Michael!

199
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,500
You alright?

200
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,959
He's still behind us.

201
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,550
Hold on.

202
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,523
On your feet, Bagwell.

203
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:46,689
Skewers are hot!

204
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,248
He's got a key!

205
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,412
I'm going to get that key
if I have to...

206
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,090
We're going to see
that key again, friend.

207
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,891
We're going to see it real soon.

208
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,369
Give me my credit card.

209
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,468
What did you get me?

210
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,306
What else you get?

211
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:48,073
Prune juice, smokes,
a little dip and a bag of sliders.

212
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,533
What do you want first?

213
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,768
Looks like a chew guy to me.

214
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,529
No spitting.

215
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,906
He's had worse things in his mouth.

216
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:50,473
What do you want, Fernando,

217
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,360
from the future?

218
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:57,728
Would you run if I said "You"?

219
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:01,563
Would you chase me if I did?

220
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,261
We got to get back to my car.

221
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,748
It's too far.

222
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,792
If we go now,
before he gets more people...

223
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,669
He's not gonna call for backup.

224
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,511
He wants his privacy.

225
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,339
Why?

226
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,161
He's not trying to catch me.

227
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,925
He's trying to kill me.

228
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,586
Your grandfather.

229
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,775
He was the reason
I was set up in the first place.

230
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:58,705
He used to work for the people
who wanted me dead.

231
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,419
This is all just to get to him.

232
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,744
Your father should be arriving
any minute.

233
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,123
Jane, right?

234
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,116
Sorry.

235
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,689
Don't worry about it.

236
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,311
You know my dad?

237
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,763
Well?

238
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,623
Well enough.

239
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,521
We used to work together.

240
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:26,259
The Company...

241
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,196
Yeah.

242
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,110
But that was a long time ago.

243
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,753
And now, I work against them,
just like he does.

244
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,829
So, I guess you walked out
on your family, too.

245
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:37,683
- No explanations, no good-byes.
- I don't have a family.

246
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,989
Lincoln, he really wants
to see you and your brother.

247
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,373
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was ten years old.

248
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:44,686
They're here.

249
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,919
Wait here.

250
00:23:56,238 --> 00:23:57,344
Let's go.

251
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,994
Where are we going?

252
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,282
Michael never met your grandfather.

253
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,928
Dad.

254
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,710
I don't want to get trapped in here.

255
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,862
There's got to be an exit
on the other side.

256
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,152
- You go on.
- Michael.

257
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,806
I'll be right behind you. Go.

258
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,814
The news is not good. Burrows
was intercepted before I got here.

259
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:44,115
It is a setback,
but we're not that far behind.

260
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:46,303
Paul, Paul, calm down.

261
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,390
It'll be all right.
Someone will take care of it.

262
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,426
Someone... who?

263
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,040
Bill, tell me you're not bringing
someone else in on this.

264
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,200
You didn't think you were
alone on this, did you?

265
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,388
<i>You're a soldier. There's an army.</i>

266
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,415
Tell me,
what do you have on Sara Tancredi?

267
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:06,871
What does that have to do with this?

268
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,585
Go back to your original assignment.

269
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,012
Bill, I'm here now. I can do this,

270
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,456
<i>- and then...</i>
- The girl.

271
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:15,480
<i>We need to know
what her father told her.</i>

272
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,360
When you find out, give me a call.

273
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:25,710
This is agent Kellerman.

274
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:28,740
I need that rental car information
on Sara Tancredi.

275
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:13,770
<i>Yeah, this is it right here.</i>

276
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,756
75-foot, twin diesel Azimut,

277
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,629
flybridge, panoramics.

278
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:22,935
You pull up in a boat like that,
you're somebody.

279
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,199
- Let me see.
- Get off.

280
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:37,434
How ya doing, Bagwell?

281
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,110
Get the stool.

282
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:45,472
- What stool?
- The stool.

283
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:56,943
It's from one of them lockers
in a bus station.

284
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,060
I'll try not to think about
where it's been.

285
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:13,244
<i>- 911 operator, what is your emergency?</i>
- Don't do that, now. Come on.

286
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:16,450
Hey, there. Send the police.
Some scumbag broke into my house.

287
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:19,038
<i>- Your address?</i>
- Yeah, 1505 Marberry Hill.

288
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,715
<i>- Is he still there?</i>
- Yeah, you better come quick.

289
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,340
Let's hit it, Roy.

290
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,749
Come on, now, please don't do this.

291
00:29:25,794 --> 00:29:27,621
Don't... just don't leave me
like this, okay?

292
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,832
I can take you to the money,
I know right where it is.

293
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:31,287
So do I. Adios.

294
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,442
I'm begging you, don't do this. Please!

295
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,386
Geary, come on, we can make a deal.

296
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:37,514
No deals.

297
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,033
You just crapped out
your last bargaining chip, pal.

298
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,506
Please!

299
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,862
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Alex.

300
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:34,746
You smell that?

301
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:36,686
It's propane.

302
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,726
It's filling the room.

303
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:43,161
And if you pull that trigger,
we both die.

304
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:59,516
I'll do it. I'll do it!

305
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,924
Maybe.

306
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:05,722
But before you do,
let me ask you a question, Alex.

307
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:10,340
Do you think you're still one of
the good guys fighting the good fight?

308
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,715
Because I think
we both know you've crossed over.

309
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,800
You're on the wrong side
chasing the wrong guys.

310
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,641
My brother is innocent.
He never killed anyone.

311
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,009
Oh, thanks for opening my eyes.

312
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,769
Okay, Alex, shoot.

313
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,714
We both know what will happen.

314
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:30,573
The propane will kill me anyway,
what difference does it make?

315
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:33,168
- Might as well do it right now.
- That's a good point.

316
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:36,456
Here we go.

317
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,010
There. There!

318
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:44,074
That'll give you some time to
think about what you're doing.

319
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:46,636
But first, a word of advice: stop.

320
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:51,119
Because when you get close,
I will win every time.

321
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:54,976
You think?

322
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,238
- I'm not the one in the cage.
- No, you're not.

323
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,751
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

324
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:06,411
And you just proved it.

325
00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:08,687
You can't kill.

326
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,345
And that's what
it's gonna take to stop me.

327
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,157
'Cause I don't have
the same reservations.

328
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,880
I can.

329
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,019
So whether it's today in Gila

330
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:21,861
or tomorrow in Albuquerque
or two months from now...

331
00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:23,214
in Panama.

332
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,029
I will get you.

333
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,291
I don't have a choice.

334
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,166
I bought us some time.

335
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,838
You okay? You're bleeding.

336
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:03,320
Let's go.

337
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,370
Your seatbelt.

338
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:25,319
Here. 804.

339
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,190
Move.

340
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:49,608
Ain't that the most beautiful
thing you ever seen?

341
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,534
All that green.

342
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:54,376
It's prettier than the Grand Canyon.

343
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,586
You know, Roy, this is a monumental
moment for both of us.

344
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,110
Hand over the bag, Bellick.

345
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,974
- Put down the pounder, grandma.
- Hey, hey. I am not kidding around.

346
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,980
Well, you think your pansy ass...

347
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,002
Next time, you pick through the crap.

348
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,357
Okay, first-aid kit, disposable phones,
couple of toothbrushes.

349
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:57,069
What about the motel?

350
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:00,070
They charge by the hour,
so they didn't ask for I.D.

351
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:09,212
- Do you have the keys?
- Yeah.

352
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:13,549
Put your hat.

353
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:32,540
<i>Sorry, we're not home. Leave a message
at the beep and we'll get back to you.</i>

354
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,770
Listen. This is a message for Maricruz.

355
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,830
I was right there waiting for your call,

356
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,407
but the cops showed up and
I couldn't pick up the phone.

357
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:45,760
I know probably that's the exact reason
why you may not want to be with me.

358
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,690
Listen to me.

359
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:52,001
My aunt Idalyz,
she lives outside Mexico city,

360
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,331
in the mountains, on a farm, with...
with a lama for the baby to ride.

361
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,811
So,

362
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:00,322
next week,

363
00:36:00,435 --> 00:36:04,811
when you fly back home, when you go
to the airport, I'll be there.

364
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,570
In the airport.
In Ixtapa, waiting for you.

365
00:36:08,643 --> 00:36:10,289
I promise you, mi herrida.

366
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:13,380
I love you, Mari.

367
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:16,100
I love you more than anything
and I can't live without you.

368
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,592
I just know, I can make it work, baby.

369
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,620
This is, in case
you run into trouble down the road.

370
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,741
I have a way.

371
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,294
- Where is she?
- Who?

372
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,810
Maricruz. She wasn't home
and she's not at work.

373
00:36:38,855 --> 00:36:40,957
She's not here.
I don't know where she is.

374
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:43,858
Trying to cause problems to me, bitch?
Don't lie to me.

375
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,094
She went to Mexico, didn't she?

376
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:57,189
And on our honeymoon.

377
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,640
Paid for with my money.

378
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,397
This isn't gonna feel good.

379
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,753
I have a high tolerance for pain.
You know that.

380
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,140
You do.

381
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,017
And you're not a diabetic, are you?

382
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,120
All right.

383
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,684
Michael, tell me something.

384
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,777
You think there's a part of you
that enjoys this?

385
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,154
Peroxide in an open wound? No.

386
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,632
I mean escaping from prison

387
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,113
and being on the run and the danger and
the fear and the rush, all that.

388
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,538
It...

389
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,950
It feels to me like... chasing a high.

390
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,495
And...
and I know what that's like and...

391
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,825
I should know better by now.

392
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,047
I never thought about it like that.

393
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,208
I know you've heard this before,

394
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:21,878
but it won't always be like this.

395
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,388
From everything you've told me,
it's just getting worse.

396
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,074
They can't chase us forever.

397
00:38:27,532 --> 00:38:29,043
The guy who caught up with us today,

398
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,970
he stops at the border,
and that's why we have to get across.

399
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,465
And I have the people in place
to help us do that.

400
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:35,970
We're meeting them tomorrow.

401
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,966
One more day, Sara.

402
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,881
One more day.

403
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,314
That's all I'm asking.

404
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:51,292
You can go get cleaned up.

405
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,231
Keep this dry.

406
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,036
I'm glad you came.

407
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,235
So...

408
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,490
- this is him.
- Lincoln, Jr.

409
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,201
- You named him after yourself.
- I wasn't gonna name him Aldo.

410
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,255
L.J, this is your grandfather,

411
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,164
Aldo Burrows.

412
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:52,214
Waited for this for a long time.

413
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:02,892
I've arranged a safe place
for both of you to go to.

414
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:07,870
Well, thanks for bailing us out, but...

415
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:09,900
we got to meet Michael.

416
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,661
Where is he?

417
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,930
Down by the border,
a place called Bolshoi Booze.

418
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,089
- I can go alone and get him.
- No.

419
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,049
Things are different.

420
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,056
There's some evidence.

421
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,141
We just need a little more time,

422
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:29,423
and we can blow
this whole thing wide open...

423
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,805
But there is no time. I trust Michael.

424
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,428
He has a plan to get us to Panama.

425
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:34,916
You don't understand.

426
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,222
You don't need to go to Panama.

427
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,137
You don't need to run anymore.

428
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,119
<i>Tell me good news.</i>

429
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,024
I got Burrows, the trifecta.

430
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,838
<i>Take care of them.</i>

431
00:40:56,878 --> 00:40:58,804
What about Scofield?
They're gonna meet him.

432
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,968
It doesn't matter.

433
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,478
Do it now.

434
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,223
Sara?

435
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,118
Hi, Sara.
