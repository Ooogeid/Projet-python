1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,800
previously on prison break

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,000
LJ and sara will be traded for Whistler

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,400
are we clear?

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,800
this can't be done in a week.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,700
You have a week. That's it.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,900
No one's ever broken out of this place before,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,000
let alone with a week to plan, so you tell these people

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm gonna break this guy out of here

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,900
or I'm going to die trying.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,300
You're going to stay on as my ears.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,400
You'll report back to me everything you hear

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,500
when I'm not around.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
I know he ran into my girlfriend,

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,100
and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,500
This is what they took from me.

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's be clear,

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
this is what matters to me.

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,100
Not you.

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,900
And not your book.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,000
How's LJ? How's Sara?

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,600
They told me they're fine.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
What are you not telling me?

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,100
You're not the only one affected...

25
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,100
They killed Sara and put her head in a box!

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,300
And they got my son!

27
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,100
you are running out of the time

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
what's that?

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,100
A rat.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
J.P. Getty had a formula for success.

31
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
"Rise early, work hard,

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
strike oil."

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,100
Just trying to get a drink of water, Alex.

34
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,900
As a devoted student of your work a skills,

35
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,800
I-I really look forward

36
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,500
to progress on your plan, Michael.

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm looking forward to you getting off my back.

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,300
Buenos, welcome to Sona.

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Is that your wallet?

40
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,200
Dame tu billetera.

41
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,500
No hablo Espal, uh?

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You know what I said.

43
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,800
No.

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
That's the wrong answer.

46
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are.

47
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,200
Scofield,visita.

48
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,500
scofield, you have a visitor.

49
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,900
You look like you had a long night.

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,800
Yeah.

51
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,600
I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat.

52
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
I don't have a whole lot to work with these days.

53
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,200
She's got the book, man, the bird guide.

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,200
She worked it out.

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
So we have no leverage.

56
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,600
-No.  -Tell me

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
When you were handing over the book,

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,700
did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?

59
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,300
Yeah.

60
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,300
And where is it?

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,900
She showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.

62
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Man, I'm not in a position to bargain with these people.

63
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,000
I mean, they're pissed.

64
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,500
You break out tomorrow.

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,700
Let's just focus on that.

66
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,400
Let's keep on track.

67
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:23,700
All right.

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,000
While I'm working from the inside,

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
I need you to take care of what happens

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,300
once we're outside.

71
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,000
We're going to need a getaway vehicle,

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,300
something inconspicuous.

73
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,200
Whatever you find, it has to be parked

74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
a half mile from here by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

75
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,600
You mean a.m.

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,700
No, I mean p.m.

77
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
We don't have a choice, Linc.

78
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,400
I ran some tests last night.

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Military jeeps patrol the perimeter at night.

80
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,200
There's no way of telling where they're going to be in the dark.

81
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
They were out there all night.

82
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,100
We need the dark, we can't just... Just...

83
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,400
Please.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Because we're doing this tomorrow.

85
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,000
In the middle of the day.

86
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,200
Who're you looking at?

87
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,100
That guy.

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,300
I know him.

89
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,900
McGrady, my friend, I'm going to need a watch.

90
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,500
Maybe two.

91
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm not even going to ask why.

92
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm also going to need some binoculars.

93
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,800
Old Guillermo has a pair.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,300
There's no way he'll sell them to you, man.

95
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,000
But they shouldn't be hard to get.

96
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Where can I find this guy?

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,900
We leave tomorrow.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,500
This...

99
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,800
This is how we're getting out of Sona.

100
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,800
Getting out of the cell block

101
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,900
shouldn't be a problem.

102
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,100
The grate and bars are weak,

103
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
but we're going to need some kind of rope,

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side.

105
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,100
That's why I figured out the safest

106
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,400
line from here to the hole in the fence.

107
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,900
We do it in the day,

108
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,400
we'll only be visible to the two guard towers.

109
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,500
The perimeter guards are less predictable,

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,500
but they're only on at night.

111
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,600
Scurrying across the fld in the middle of the day?

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
It's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol.

113
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,400
Now, in the yard tomorrow, there's a soccer game at 2:00.

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
That should prove some distraction inside.

115
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,900
And yesterday when we were digging,

116
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,000
I saw the glare from the sun hit this guy

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,900
in the late afternoon.

118
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,700
Looked like he turned away,

119
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,300
like maybe his vision was blocked.

120
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,600
It's not much of a break.

121
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,300
No, but it is

122
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,800
one way to do what we need to do.

123
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
As far as thisther guard,

124
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,200
his weakness has yet to be termined.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,100
If we're going to get around these guys,

126
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
we've got to get to know them.

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,600
It's not going to be easy.

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
There's only one real road that goes to the prison.

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
We don't want a real road-- that's not an option.

130
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,700
What?

131
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,600
Your brother's cutting it close.

132
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,500
You said a week.

133
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Tomorrow's Wednesday, you didn't leave much room for error.

134
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,600
There's not going to be an "error."

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Listen, I've got a lot of stuff to do and I just...

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Which is why I won't waste yourime.

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
When Whistler's free, I need to get to him

138
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,300
as soon as possible.

139
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,700
I'm still trying to work out what's going

140
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,900
to happen once they get past the fence.

141
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
Once I know all the details, I'll let you...

142
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,100
Lincoln, calm down.

143
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,300
It sounds to me like you

144
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,400
and your brother are in over your heads.

145
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,000
There's a bad joke about Sara somewhere in there.

146
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,800
Listen...

147
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll let you know all the details

148
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,900
on I know them, and then I'll call you.

149
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
I want this to work out just as badly as you do.

150
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
MoreI'm sure.

151
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,000
LJ?

152
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,500
LJ's fine. You have 34 hours.

153
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,200
What did she say?

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Nothing we don't already know.

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,800
Let's get out of here; we got a lot of stuff to do.

156
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,300
Seir Rivera?

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Who?

158
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,800
You're Jorge Rivera, right?

159
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
Gravedigger at Sona?

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,500
so?

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,300
Would you like a ride?

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
No no, someone's coming to get me in a little bit.

163
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,500
I had an arrangement with your predecessor.

164
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,500
I need you to get this inside the prison.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,500
I don't go inside the prison.

166
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
Neither did he.

167
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
How about this?

168
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
You find a way to get this delivery

169
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,500
inside the prison

170
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,900
just this one time.

171
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,900
Why would I?

172
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Becuase I would give you

173
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,700
five thousand dollars.

174
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,300
Five thousand dollars?

175
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
For just one time?

176
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Couldn't you do that?

177
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,200
I think you could do it.

178
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,500
In this?

179
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,700
You're crazy!

180
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,600
Only you can do it.

181
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,900
I wouldn't let 'em see you do that.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,200
Who?

183
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
Anyone. It's a drinking fountain.

184
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,500
They put their lips right on there.

185
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,100
You'd think it spits straight Jack Daniels.

186
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
You understand what happened, don't you?

187
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,300
You're a-- what's-it- called?-- a pariah.

188
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,200
I made the same mistake when I walked in here

189
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,600
tried to hang on to my wallet.

190
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,200
Next thing I knew, I spent the next two days kneecap deep

191
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,400
in human feces.

192
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,400
In Sona, it's every man for himself.

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,100
Here, cheese.

194
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm not hungry.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Yeah, you will be.

196
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
I saw the other Americans.

197
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,700
So none of you have called the embassy, huh?

198
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,700
Us gringos ain't all butt buddies.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,700
You want it? Cause I'll keep it.

200
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,900
Let's get this done.

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
We're gonna have to tch both guards simultaneously.

202
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,500
Your cell should provide

203
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,300
a good view of the guard I saw yesterday.

204
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,000
Keep track of everything he does and when he does it.

205
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,300
Look for that glare, see if it shows up again.

206
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,300
What will you be doing?

207
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,300
Watching the other tower from here.

208
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,600
While our back's turned, we're gonna need a lookout.

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,100
Well, find Mahone.

210
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
I thought we were stringing him along?

211
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,300
Looks like we're out of string.

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,400
Teodoro.

213
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Si, patron?

214
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,300
What they say about all work d no play, huh?

215
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,900
Boy need his rest.

216
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,900
Your clientele keeps a tight schedule.

217
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,200
Got to make sure I see to their needs.

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,700
I gave you a more important task.

219
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,200
But I haven't heard a thing.

220
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,000
en listen harder.

221
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,300
Mi amor.

222
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,400
Ah, mi vida.

223
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,400
Into my office.

224
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,200
Sit down, watch the game.

225
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Excuse me.

226
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,300
Anything yet?

227
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Nope, not yet.

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So what's your story, man?

229
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,100
I mean, the next chapter,

230
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,900
when we get out of here.

231
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,200
Suppose you were married to the job,

232
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,100
drank too much, rabid insomniac, typical lawman.

233
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,400
Yeah, just like you reek of live bait,

234
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
have a girl in every port,

235
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,300
tell fish stories

236
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
or so I've heard.

237
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Prior to this experience,

238
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,400
I had the utmost respect for the law.

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
This guy hasn't so much has scratched his jock in an hour.

240
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,600
It's not gonna be easy to get around that guy.

241
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,300
I don't know.

242
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
We might just have a break.

243
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,900
I'm gonna go check on Scofield.

244
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,200
Sorry.

245
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,800
Did you see thglare?

246
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
13-- he turned to his right

247
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
and ignored everything to the west for six minutes,

248
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,400
as far as I could tell.

249
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,000
This guy thinks he's auditioning for Buckingham Palace.

250
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,000
He's also a sports fan.

251
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,800
He's got a TV.

252
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,700
Twice in the last four hours the signal went fuzzy.

253
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,800
He had to turn to adjust the antennae.

254
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,000
That's nothing we can count on.

255
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,400
True.

256
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,900
But there is a device we can build

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
out of some pretty common materials.

258
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
It's almost like a radio, except it...

259
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
transmits signals.

260
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,300
Pardon me.

261
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,800
You're the new guy.

262
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,200
Yeah. And who are you?

263
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,100
Not the new guy.

264
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,700
So what's your deal?

265
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,300
Public intoxication, tourist in trouble-- what is it?

266
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
I don't like people asking too many questions.

267
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
when I've done nothing wrong.

268
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,300
Oh, you're an innocent man.

269
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,400
As a matter of fact, yes.

270
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Is this your first time in prison?

271
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,000
Uh-huh. Why? Because it's obvious--

272
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,700
Rule No.1

273
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,000
you mind your own business.

274
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,500
You know, you might want to do the same.

275
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,800
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

276
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,400
You got me?

277
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,600
Yeah.

278
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,100
Yeah.

279
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,400
I got you.

280
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,100
Go take a walk.

281
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,700
When'd you meet your boyfriend, Whistler?

282
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,600
My last year of school.

283
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
I worked in this place in San Isabel.

284
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,000
He used to come around

285
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
by himself and sit down in a bar.

286
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,300
Hitting on the waitress. That's romantic.

287
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,100
He is!

288
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Every time he goes away,

289
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,200
he brings me back a present 

290
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,600
like this

291
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,100
Those are from Sedona.

292
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,000
His mother lives there in a retirement home.

293
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,800
What's going on?!

294
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,400
Out of the car, Juan Bobo!

295
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,700
This is a private road.

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
I can explain. Callete!

297
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,600
What'd we do?

298
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,100
Shut your uth, American.

299
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,100
u?paso

300
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,600
This is state property! No vehicles allowed!

301
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,500
All roads within two miles of Sona are closed.

302
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
We, we didn't see any signs.

303
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,600
Where were you going?

304
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,200
San Isabel.

305
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,800
San Isabel? Yeah.

306
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,900
This your car?

307
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,800
It's my car.

308
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,100
The papers in the glove box.

309
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,000
This is why my friends don't visit Panama.

310
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,000
You cops bother everyone.

311
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
This road is not for tourists.

312
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,600
If I ever catch you out here again,

313
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,500
I'll remeber you.

314
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,900
It ain't gonna happen again.

315
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,900
Okay, go on.

316
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,100
Anda.

317
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,300
You okay?

318
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,300
Yeah. This is not gonna work.

319
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Where's the coast from here? I don't know, maybe three miles.

320
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
All right, time for plan B. Come on.

321
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,000
Found some more of these.

322
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,400
We can make rope out of this hammock.

323
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,200
Come on. You don't want to go in there.

324
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,900
If you want to get out of this place I do.

325
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,100
Stay here.

326
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,600
he Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

327
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,600
Move it!

328
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Come on!

329
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,700
What is it, chained down?

330
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
It's hanging by a thread.

331
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,100
It'll have to wait.

332
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,600
30.

333
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,200
We've got less than 24 hours. We'll make it.

334
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,300
Tell me why.What?

335
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,500
What's so urgent we can't get

336
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,900
you out of here the day after tomorrow?

337
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,400
I don't know. I don't have all the answers.

338
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
You don't me, I don't know you,

339
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,500
but it's your job to get me out of here.

340
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,200
We'll come back later.

341
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,300
I'll take this as well.

342
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,100
Down here for the summer? Yep.

343
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,700
That's what I thought, back in 1985.

344
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,500
Two wives, 20 years later.

345
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,500
Want everything in here?

346
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,900
Yeah, thanks.

347
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,500
International waters far out?

348
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
That's 12 nautical miles.

349
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
12 nautical miles, huh?

350
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,000
Is that gonna do it here?

351
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,300
Uh, yeah.

352
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
$99.25.

353
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,300
Here.

354
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,200
All right.

355
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,200
Thank you.

356
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,000
What did you get?

357
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Supplies. Can you pop the trunk, please?

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
Who am I gonna tell, honestly?

359
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,900
You could be a Russian spy for all I know.

360
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,200
Live out of this thing?

361
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:20,600
I have to be

362
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
prepared in case of an emergency.

363
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Well, we got an emergency.

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm not going anywhere

365
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,800
until you tell me where we're going.

366
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,100
Solana Beach. Why?

367
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,200
They killed Sara.

368
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,900
I'm trying to make damn sure they don't kill my son.

369
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,500
You don't think for a second

370
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,450
your boy's not on that list, stay here.

371
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,610
I couldn't care less.

372
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,300
What is it?

373
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,890
It's... Augusto.

374
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,170
He won't

375
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,710
pay the payment for you anymore.

376
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,630
I went to him for payment like every Monday, and...

377
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,540
he said it's not his responsibility

378
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,100
and that I should ask you.

379
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,470
No, no, no, no.

380
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,790
You tell Augusto

381
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,730
I don't pay for sex.

382
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,150
I know, I did.

383
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,210
But... what I do?

384
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,350
I don't see anyone else...

385
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,370
Yeah?

386
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,550
Well, neither do I.

387
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,860
You in charge of the food now?

388
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,640
No boss. I'm the new gravedigger.

389
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,810
You need to sign in 

390
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,900
before you get on the truck.

391
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,790
I was just about to.

392
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,810
Have you read the rulebook?

393
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:27,790
Yes, sir.

394
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,690
Read it again.

395
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,840
On the other side, when we get out of here,

396
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,030
what's gonna happen?

397
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,710
We're gonna meet someone from this mpany...

398
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,600
Apparently.

399
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,600
And then they're gonna kill me.

400
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,440
You know that.

401
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,670
If they wanted to kill you,

402
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,870
you'd already be dead.

403
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,520
I don't see why they keep me alive.

404
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,980
It's like you said-- you've got something they want.

405
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,330
Once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them.

406
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,670
Right?

407
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,500
I don't have all the answers.

408
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,050
All I know is it's my job to get you out of here.

409
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,790
Let's go.

410
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,540
It's twofer Tuesday, my one-time special just for you.

411
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,970
But there's a price.

412
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,840
Lechero's getting pret sensitive about the cash flow.

413
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,450
Well, I'm a little short right now.

414
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,670
No worries, Alex.

415
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,790
I am notgonna leave you hanging, all right?

416
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,660
We can just start you a tab.

417
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,430
Think he saw us?

418
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,730
Guess we'll find out.

419
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,790
My third year in school,

420
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,320
we studied electrical engineering with a focus on EMPs.

421
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,460
That's electromagnetic pulses.

422
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,760
If you hook up a pow source to a transmitter,

423
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,030
it generates a pulse.

424
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,090
That pulse crashes anything electronic.

425
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,110
What's that, like an intro

426
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,610
an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?

427
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,560
Basically. These days,

428
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,350
they have to teach students how to defend

429
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,400
their structures.

430
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,930
Fortunately for us, that guard tower is...

431
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,080
It was engineered a long time ago.

432
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair.

433
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,080
Plug this in.

434
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,990
Did it crash the telly?

435
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,680
We're too far away.

436
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,410
But it is doing exactly what we need it to.

438
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:40,940
Okay.

439
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,820
Get out! Why?

440
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,740
They're coming in.

441
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,790
Ahora mismo.

442
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,410
Stay here. Do not let them see her.

443
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,380
Do not!

444
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,110
Colonel.

445
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,110
We received no word of this!

446
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,800
A rifle scope waseen from the tower.

447
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,400
Capitan Hurtado saw it with his own eyes.

448
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,590
That's impossible.

449
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,140
There is a gun in your prison,

450
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,650
and it was pointing at one of my men.

451
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,170
We are going to find it.

452
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,310
This looks good.

453
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,270
For what?

454
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,050
Have a seat.

455
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,450
What am I supposed

456
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,230
to doing here?

457
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,780
Look like you're having fun.

458
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,490
When was the last time you saw your son?

459
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,470
You know, Lincoln,

460
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,170
I don't automatically trust people either,

461
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,340
but at least I can tell when they have good intentions.

462
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,860
Good for you.

463
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,760
You know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore.

464
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,160
You do your job, and I'll do mine.

465
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,670
You need something?

466
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,320
What? You need something?

467
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,130
No.

468
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,140
Good.

469
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,800
Don't you worry. It's all gonna be okay.

470
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,080
No, it's not. I promise you, I will not let

471
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,140
anyone find you in here.

472
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,100
Oh... Lechero hate me.

473
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,270
Lechero does not hate you.

474
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,440
You hold a very special place in his heart.

475
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,610
So many girls can take my place.

476
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,430
No, he's smart. He knows you're better than them.

477
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,710
You're a real woman.

478
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,890
A woman of her own will, her own desire.

479
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,130
You know what I am.

480
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,420
In this world, sister, we are all prostitutes.

481
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,190
You are a queen.

484
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,290
Whose cell is that?

485
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,400
In the corner?

486
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,870
Is that your cell?

487
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,700
You

488
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,700
Is that your cell?

489
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,700
It's mine!

490
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,200
It's mine.

491
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,100
s mine.

492
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,100
I found this.

493
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,800
It's not a weapon.

494
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,600
I know what it is.

495
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,900
Why were you watching me?

496
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,700
i want to ask you 

497
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
one more time.

498
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Why were you watching me?

499
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,800
I wasn't watching you -- I saw you.

500
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,700
Answer the question!

500
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,700 
I don't know what you think you saw but i wasn't watching you.

501
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,300
Lie!

502
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,800
I wasn't watching you.

503
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,600
It's mine.

504
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Why were you watching him?

505
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,800
I... I wasn't. I was, uh...

506
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,900
I was watching birds.

507
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,200
Yes.

508
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,200
Yes.

509
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,800
See?

510
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,000
Why did you not speak up before?

512
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,400
I, uh...

513
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,600
I was scared.

514
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,200
I was scared.

515
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Coward.

516
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Hurtado! Ya. Dejelo.

517
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,100
Come on.

518
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,900
Come on!

519
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,300
please, please, please.

520
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,600
come on.

521
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
He's coming back up here.

522
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,500
Now, don't worry.

523
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,300
It's all going to be okay.

524
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,600
You have a little mascara right there.

525
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,600
You need to look pretty for Lechero.

526
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,300
Thank you.

527
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,200
Wait right here.

528
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,600
A patrol passed through, but they didn't stay.

529
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,500
Knock some things over then walked away.

530
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,300
I hid your woman in a safe place,

531
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,900
but I'd be lying

532
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,300
if I didn't say it was a close call.

533
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,400
Is she alone?

534
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,800
Yeah.

535
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,900
Hey.

536
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,300
Don't be afraid.

537
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,000
No, no, my dear.

538
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,900
They're gone.

539
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,500
I should go, too.

540
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,000
No, no, no. What's the rush?

541
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,900
Come on. No, I should

542
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,700
get home.

543
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,000
Patr,

544
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,500
I gave her the money.

545
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,800
I was going to replace it myself

546
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,600
at the end of the day, when I get my cut.

547
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,000
I just didn't get a chance to tell you.

548
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,500
She had no money to get home.

549
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,300
Is this true?

550
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,700
Yes.

551
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,200
With all due respect.

552
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,500
Surely you don't want your mistress travelin' broke.

553
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,400
She'd end up in a taxi

554
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,100
with no way to pay the cab fare.

555
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,300
Ah, you did this?

556
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,100
For me?

557
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,400
Si, patr.

558
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,000
Teodoro.

559
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The one that does all

560
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
the useful things for me, huh?

561
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,900
And now you do the thinking for me.

562
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,400
No, no, it's not like that, patr--

563
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,400
Get the bucket.

564
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,600
Wash my feet.

565
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,500
So what do we do now?

566
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,700
I don't know.

567
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,200
Well, I'm afraid that's not good enough.

568
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,900
Please just give me a moment to think.

569
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,000
Wasting time is not an option for me, Michael.

570
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,200
I need to be out of here by tomorrow.

571
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,200
I know, just in time for be out your next fishing trip,omorrow.

572
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,900
or is it a bird-watching trip? I forget.

573
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,800
That's my trip log, I've told you.

574
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,100
I need to retrace my steps.

575
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,300
I'm doing everything they tell me, the same thing you are.

576
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,900
just, just leave me alone, please.

577
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,400
You know, before I was arrested,

578
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,800
a man came to my flat and took my addresses.

579
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,200
They know the name of everyone I care about

580
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,600
and how to find them.

581
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,400
Well, they already found everyone I care out. Okay?

582
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,100
If you can't get me out of here, tell me now.

583
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,900
because time is running out.

584
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,100
Huh?!

585
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,100
Look, it's hot today.

586
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,600
Yeah.

587
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,200
Prefer the heat than the cold any day.

588
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,900
You know my brother and I wanted to come

589
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,900
down here to Panama

590
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and start a dive shop like the one we were at today.

591
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
My boy, he was gonna leave school and help us

592
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
start the family business.

593
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,700
When this is all over, why don't you do it?

594
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,800
Too much bad stuff's happened.

595
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,800
Still, you can make it work.

596
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,600
It's only gonna work if... if Whistler cooperates.

597
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,100
he plays games, people get hurt.

598
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,800
You understa that, right?

599
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,500
He doesn't want anyone to get hurt.

600
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,900
I hope you're right.

601
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
I want to show you something.

602
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Our getaway vehicle.

603
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,600
Now,

604
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,700
the next time you see him,

605
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,500
I want you to tell him what you saw.

606
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,200
Tell him we're all in this together.

607
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,500
We're part of a team.

608
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,700
You understand?

609
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Okay. Yeah.

610
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,400
All right, get up.

612
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,100
We're coming back.

613
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,800
No, this way.

614
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,900
What?

615
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,700
This way, come on.

616
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,100
Okay

617
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,400
If all goes well,

618
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,200
we'll see them tomorrow.

619
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,900
Job well done. Thank you.

620
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,800
I thought you said I was gonna get five thousand dollars.

621
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,900
That's what I'm talking about.

622
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,600
Nono, no, no, no.

623
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,900
You said one time.

624
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,500
Was it difficult?

625
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,500
That's not the point.

626
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,300
One time is one time.

627
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,000
This can work out for both of us.

628
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,800
If we're gonna do this today,

629
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,400
we got to replace everything we lost.

630
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,300
Like what?

631
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,700
For starters, a new exit point.

632
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,400
It's got to be on the south side of the building.

633
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,300
Look at this guy, again.

635
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,000
I know you, huh?

636
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,100
Afraid not. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

637
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,700
You're McFadden, right?

638
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,400
Nice, 1997?

639
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,300
Sorry.

640
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,800
You've confused me with someone else.

641
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.

642
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,100
You were with the ambassador.

643
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,600
You've mistaken me for someone else.

644
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,500
Chap's insane.

645
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,500
Come on, guys, got something to show you.

646
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm sure I didn't observe the guards' behavior

647
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,300
in as much detail as you guys,

648
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,600
but I did notice something yesterday.

649
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,700
Right around this time.

650
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,400
That's the day shift.

651
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,600
They start by 6:00

652
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,500
Just keep looking, keep looking.

653
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,300
There.

654
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,900
Where'd you get your cup, Alex?

655
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,900
I got it in the courtyard, but apparently it's from him.

656
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,800
He has one in the morning and one after lunch.

657
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,200
Man's got to have his fix.

658
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,400
If we get  that cup...

659
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,600
We get to the man.

660
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
We got to move.
