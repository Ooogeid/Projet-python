3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,840
It's got no electricity

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,090
And no running water.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,570
A hundred bucks a month.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,410
Deal.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,720
Ready?

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,550
I hope this works, popi.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,770
That book of yours-- it's just a bunch of coordinates

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,830
In there, right?

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,220
Among other things.

12
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,690
Does your father still have

13
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,070
That phone number I gave you?

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,310
I think so.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,070
Well, tell him to call my brother.

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,730
Papa, make that call for my friend.

17
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,540
The american?

18
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,930
If time runs out,

19
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,380
And I don't have the second half of those coordinates,

20
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,990
Lj and the senorita stop breathing.

23
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,400
Just wish there was another way to do is.

24
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,680
To save lj without handing Whistler over.

25
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,750
Look, man, that's it-- there isn't.

26
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,390
What is that?

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,580
Kesslivol.

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,180
When heated to a certain degree,

29
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,660
It eats through steel.

30
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,620
As soon as linc cuts the power we go.

31
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,650
What about the backup generator?

32
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,490
There's a lag from when the power cuts out

33
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,840
To when the generator kicks back in.

34
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,500
How long a lag we talking about?

35
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,260
30 seconds.

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,990
We only have 30 seconds. go.

38
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,250
Move it, move it.

39
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,330
Come on.

40
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,950
Let's go.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,490
Okay, let's go. not yet.

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
We have to go now. we're running out of time.

43
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,290
Trust me.

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,260
Come on, mate.

48
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,680
What's the holdup, Michael?

49
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,670
Just a little bit longer.

52
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,380
What happened?

53
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,060
They got caught.

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,630
What's going on? shut up.laring)

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,290
What, what...?

56
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,230
Don't try anything.

57
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,770
Bring 'em over here! bring 'em over here!

58
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,520
You-- on your knees, get down!

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,430
Don't move,

60
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,260
Or you're like your friend over here.

61
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,240
What's going on, Michael?

64
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,110
This sure as hell better work out.

65
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,970
For everyone's sake.

68
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,620
You two,

69
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,040
On your feet.

72
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,670
Where the hell's Scofield? shut it.

73
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,310
If Scofield doesn't get caught,

74
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,870
He could still fix this mess.

78
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:44,890
What do we do now?

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,430
The lights are on, they know about the escape... what's your plan,

80
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,020
Michael?

81
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,610
This is the plan.

82
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,890
Michael, how the hell

83
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,850
Is getting caught your plan?

84
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,510
You told them they had 30 seconds to get across

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,560
When you knew the generator was going to kick in sooner.

86
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,650
I must have miscalculated.

87
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,830
We've got about ten minutes till the sun rises.

88
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,470
And there are soldiers out there, okay.

89
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,390
They'll take count. we got to get back to the yard.

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
We're not going anywhere.

91
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,310
It's almostime.

97
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,730
What do you tnothing. it's just probably my wife.

98
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,380
You know, we live a couple miles away

99
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,750
And she must have heard the sirens, so...

100
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,890
You can make your calls when I'm done with you.

101
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,270
What else you got?

102
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,680
Sucre? I'm not here. say what you got to say.

103
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,260
Sucre, where the hell are you?!

104
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,680
We're counting on you to be here!

105
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,300
If you're not there, we're dead, man.

106
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,850
Now call me back, please.

107
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,850
Put these with his personal effects.

108
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,480
What's going on out there?

109
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,820
Some prisoners tried to escape.

110
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,950
Did they get out?

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,060
They got caught.

112
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,100
One of them got shot pretty bad.

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,220
Sucre?

114
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,100
Sucre?

115
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,280
No, it is Alphonso Gallego.

116
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,580
You where you need to be?

117
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,500
Yes.

118
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,070
I left the suburban on the side of the road.

119
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,370
The keys are in the wheel well.

120
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,280
Are they still t hecheck 'em out.

121
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,870
They're here.

122
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,020
Good, good.

123
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,620
You will be here too,

124
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,920
On the 312?

125
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah, yeah, the 312.

126
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,650
See you there.

127
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,100
These all the men? si, senor.

128
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,190
Tell me, how did you get out there?

129
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,420
How did you get out there?

130
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,700
Hmm? don't want to tell me?

131
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,310
How did you get out there?

132
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,630
A tunnel.

133
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,590
Where?

134
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
Under Lechero's room.

135
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,640
Show me.

136
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,870
How much longer?

137
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,120
It's just a matter of seconds now.

138
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,320
Michael?

139
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,250
The door.

140
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,600
I don't know the combination.

141
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,690
Then improvise.

142
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,280
This is insane.

143
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,720
Let's go.

144
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,150
Vamanos.

145
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,890
Hurry!

153
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,500
It wasn't me!

154
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,010
It was Scofield! he did this!

155
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,440
Just check the yard-- him,

156
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,670
Whistler, Mahone and that basketball kid--

157
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,610
None of 'em will be there!

161
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,710
This is captain solo. other inmates are missing.

162
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,170
I want a post-and-protect

163
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,200
Around the entire perimeter of the prison.

164
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,610
General, we see no one.

165
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,980
Are you sure there's prisoners out here?

166
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,990
You won't find the prisoners here in no-man's-land

167
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,040
Because they're already gone.

172
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,950
Off the bus now!

173
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,920
Get off the

174
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,100
Bunow!

184
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,870
What's wrong?

185
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,760
My ankle! I've torn it apart!

186
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,180
Come on.

187
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,440
It's not that far. help me up!

188
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,760
Mr. Whistler, we'll drag you by your hair

189
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,170
Because we got to go!

190
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,450
I'll slow you down. just go! just leave me!

191
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,790
We both know that's not an option.

192
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,780
It's only a quarter

193
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,590
Of a mile to the beach.

194
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,360
If we stick to the bush, we can make it.

195
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,800
Alex, a little help?

196
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,100
Go. come on!

198
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,630
Hey. we only have a few minutes.

199
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,860
We got soldiers right behind us.

200
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,730
Cops as well.

201
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,700
We got what we nd?

202
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,170
Yeah, we got what we need.

203
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,520
What do we need?

204
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,940
Always picking up the strays, huh?

205
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,230
This way.

207
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,870
Listen, Michael, if you think the company's just going

208
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,750
To let you swap me for your nephew, you're mistaken.

209
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,690
Shut up.

210
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,750
Once they get hold of me,

211
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,620
They're gonna kill all of you,

212
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,680
And I don't want Sofia caught in the crossfire.

213
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,950
Listen, just let me go.

214
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,650
I'll contact them, I promise.

215
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,650
I'll say I'll turn myself in once I know lj's safe.

216
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,150
Hey, you got no say in wha happens to my son! you got it?

217
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,380
We don't need a suntan.

218
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,760
We need to get lost.

219
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,670
The military patrols all the roads around the prison.

220
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
You didn't consider a boat?

221
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,830
They show up here and we're ten yards off the shore,

222
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,080
We're target practice.

223
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,340
We need to be invisible.

224
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,950
Five guys, four tanks.

225
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,330
Sucks for you, Mahone.

226
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,780
Lincoln and I will share.

227
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,290
Toss your boots in the box.

228
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,370
Yeah?

229
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,420
Tell me you have him.

230
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,230
Yeah, I got him.

231
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,440
Where's my son?

232
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,830
With me. put him on the phone now.

233
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,960
Say something.

234
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,650
I'll be there soon. just don't hurt anyone.

235
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,930
You happy?

236
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,490
You have 20 minutes to meet me in panama city

237
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,770
Where we agreed.

238
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,110
We'll be there.

239
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,040
Hey, I need to put my book in there.

240
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,060
The book? my book!

241
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,930
It must have fell out of my pocket.

242
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,640
I thought you already figured out the coordinates.

243
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,890
Well, I didn't memorize them! I wrote them in the book!

244
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm pretty sure they're still looking for us, guys.

245
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,940
It's gone. now get in the damn water.

246
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,310
Would you please? it's a picture of my son.

247
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,840
Can you, uh...

248
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,470
Put it in the bag?

249
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,260
Screw you, Mahone.

250
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,270
Let's go.

251
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,450
McGrady. mcGrady?

252
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,110
I don't swim so good.

253
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,300
What?

254
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,720
Too bad, kid, you're getting wet. get in.

255
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,120
Look it's all right.

256
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,530
We'll share tanks. just hold onto me

257
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,190
And we'll switch off back and forth, ten seconds apiece.

258
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,480
Come on. let's go.

267
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,420
Where is Scofield?!

268
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,410
I don't know! he didn't tell me nothing!

269
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,040
Where is he running?

270
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,520
I told you, I don't know nothing!

271
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,860
Well, there's only one way to make certain of that.

278
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,200
This is general Mestas. the men will be sent.

279
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,840
And, Sojo, I expect every prisoner

280
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,770
To be returned to Sona today.

281
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,550
Dispatch fourth platoon.

282
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,510
Hey, hey, look, man, this is getting crazy here.

283
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,930
Look, I'll plead guilty for ignoring the warrant.

284
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,260
I'll show up for the court hearings.

285
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,530
Let me get out of here.

286
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,120
You know, with this alarms and the guns,

287
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,710
They're making me a little nervous.

288
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,250
Until things settle in, you go nowhere.

289
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,720
So just sit tight.

290
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,370
Urfo platoon goes to Cabrillo beach ahora.

291
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,220
There!

292
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,960
Where is he?

293
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,520
Where is he?

294
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,980
Where is he?

295
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,080
Where's who?

296
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,020
Sucre with the boat.

297
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,130
Ju hold on.

298
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,440
You all right? you all right?

299
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,700
Yeah.

300
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,250
I'm all right, I'm all right.

301
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,050
We're not gonna make it

302
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,410
Out here too much longer, Michael.

303
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,250
Sucre is coming. be patient.

304
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,090
Excuse me?

305
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,760
Boat 312, why is it still here?

306
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,570
Wasn't someone supposed to take that out today?

307
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,020
Someone reserved it, but they never picked it up.

308
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,020
Yes, general.

309
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,200
I want an update.

310
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,420
Still no sign of them. nothing on the coast.

311
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,330
I think they may have gone back into the jungle.

312
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,650
The jungle? you asked me to send men to the beach!

313
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,570
Capitan...

314
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,290
Just a moment, general.

315
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,000
General, I think we have to call the coast guard.

316
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,070
Come on!

317
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,840
You all right?

318
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,710
My legs are starting to cramp.

319
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,410
You gotta hold on, buddy.

320
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,000
We're not gonna last out here too long, Michael.

321
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,410
Where's your friend, Michael?

322
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,930
Sucre's not just gonna abandon us out here, all right?

323
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,350
He'll show, he'll show.

324
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,010
The coast guard is launching four vessels...

325
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,640
They've been in the water this whole time.

326
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,520
They're probably at the bottom of the ocean by now.

327
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,170
Well, look it here!

328
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,160
A drunk and disorderlyke we warrant for jorge rivera.han

329
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,390
Failure to pay child support.

335
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,880
You're not going anywhere.

336
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,710
Once we're done processing you, then you can go.

337
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,810
Until then, sit tight.

338
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,480
I should have heard something by now.

339
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,490
I've lost all damn track of them.

340
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,090
Burrows will eventually reach out if he wants his son ck.

341
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,530
Yeah, well, that might no longer be an option.

342
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,970
Look! look!

343
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,930
Sucre!

344
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,920
Sucre!

345
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,270
He's supposed to be flashing a light.

346
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,530
He's not responding, Linc.

347
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,560
The coast guard. they found us.

348
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,560
Papa!

350
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,740
Michael... Michael?

351
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,440
If I don't get another chance, I want

352
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,840
You to know that I appreciate everything you've done.

353
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,630
You're welcome.

354
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,690
Come on, son.

355
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,350
How'd you find us?

356
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,290
You never showed, and you said you'd be coming

357
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,190
From the southwest, so I took a chance.

358
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,440
What do you think happened to Sucre?

359
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,080
Don't know, but we gotta move.

363
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,010
Guess that just leaves one.

364
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,970
Get up.

365
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,680
Let's go.

366
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,160
I saw the boxes in the back, so I took your car--

367
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,660
Figured you'd need to change

368
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,920
How's the ankle?

369
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,320
I need to get off my feet.

370
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,060
All right, guys, get changed and make sure

371
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,820
You don't leave any wet clothes behind.

372
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,430
Listen, uh...

373
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,080
Thanks for everything.

374
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,270
Thank you for my boy.

375
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,160
I hope you get your son back, too.

376
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,190
Yeah, me, too.

377
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,590
Come. we need to get back to the truck.

378
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,490
Michael?

379
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,050
Thank you.

380
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,130
Go be with your family, Luis.

381
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,890
Yeah?

382
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,550
Where the hell are you?

383
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,790
We ran into some trouble. we're-we're downtown panama.

384
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,140
No, Lincoln, you're not.

385
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,400
We got company.

386
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,020
How'd they find us?

387
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,110
You have them?

388
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,180
We're right on top of them.

389
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,700
Hold on!

390
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,510
They must've gotten to Grady's dad and bugged this car.

391
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Or one of us.

392
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,950
Then why didn't they find us when we were in the water?

393
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,810
It's because the water was blocking the signal.

394
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,990
What you do with that stopwatch that Gretchen gave you?

395
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,780
Oh, my god. I didn't know.

396
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,010
I didn't know.

397
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,410
Okay, hold on, guys.

398
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,900
All right, it's time to use this rig to our advantage.

399
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,580
Go! here we go!

400
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,040
Uh... this is, like, a dead end right here.

401
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,410
Stay in the car, then.

402
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,140
This way!

403
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,270
Why don't you just tell us what you know?

404
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,910
Then you won't wind up being beaten half to death

405
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,900
Like your friend. I know less than you do.

406
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,690
Which is hard, considering how dumb you are.

407
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,170
I want everything you can find on the men who escaped

408
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,820
And I want it immediately.

412
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,350
Go see the clerk about your stuff.

413
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,040
They're barricaded.

414
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,660
What are you doing?

415
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,520
Get back!

416
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,660
All that gunfire and they only

417
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,060
Hit your car three times?

418
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,360
Son of a bi...

419
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,920
Listen, Linc, you've done a great job getting us

420
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,450
Out of the frying pan, but it'll be for nothing

421
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,800
If we end up back in the fire.

422
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,100
There's no fire, just an exchange,

423
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,030
Then I'm done with you.

424
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,060
You think it's that simple?

425
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,870
Yeah, they want you, they get you. it's that simple.

426
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,680
This is not about me. it's about Sofia and ur son. Michael--

427
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,240
Tell him-- tell him these people

428
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,250
Won't just let us walk away.

429
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,160
We already had this discussion back at the beach, James,

430
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,540
And you were outvoted.

431
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,290
You're making a terrible mistake.

432
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,670
People might die because of this.

433
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,360
Take off your pants.

434
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,990
Excuse me, ser?

435
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,230
I said take off your pants.

436
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:09,100
If I knew you boys partied in Sona like this,

437
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,370
I never would have tried to escape.

438
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,180
One cell phone.

439
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,730
One wallet.

440
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,240
And some change.

441
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,570
There were some papers.

442
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,510
A boat-rental agreement. I need them.

443
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,630
I'll check the drawer.

444
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,270
Take them down.

445
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,060
Come on, now, hombre.

446
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,270
There's no need to refry my beans.

447
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,620
Always with the wise talk.

448
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,630
Never saying anything we want to hear.

449
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,300
Now, all I want to hear are your screams.

450
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:04,880
No, no.

451
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,890
No, no, no, no, no. listen.

452
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,770
I told you, I don't know nothing.

453
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,620
No, actually, I don't know nothing.

454
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,090
I swear. I swear I don't.

455
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,340
But he does!!

456
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,850
He knows everything!

457
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,610
He knows everything!

458
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,380
Hey! not so fast, amigo.

459
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,260
Hey. a little help.

460
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,220
What is this place?

461
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,620
Where we're gonna make the exchange-- on our terms.

462
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,660
There's a service road out back, just in case

463
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,950
We want to get lost. yeah, assuming you're still alive.

464
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,440
You still talking?

465
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,560
Linc?

466
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,210
Yeah.

467
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,820
Gotta commend you on that boom box trick.

468
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,100
Very sophisticated.

469
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,770
You steal that one from home alone?

470
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,350
You fell for it, bitch.

471
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,520
All right, listen. if you wanna see your son...

473
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,270
You're not calling the shots anymore.

474
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,840
As long as I have lj....

475
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,700
As long as I got Whistler, u'yo gonna do exactly what

476
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,060
I say. you got it?

477
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,120
Now, listen up.

478
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,390
We're at an abandoned

479
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,650
Warehouse five miles down the road

480
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,760
From the barrios interchange. be there in 20 minutes

481
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,160
With my son.

482
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,630
And once I get there?

483
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,440
So now we wait.

484
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,540
Yeah.

485
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,920
Think this'll work?

486
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
Yeah, it'll work.

487
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,290
You, me and lj.

488
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,380
Yeah.

489
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,720
I just hope it works out for mcGrady, too.

490
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,040
Oh, no.

491
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,120
They must have closed all the roads out of panama.

492
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,920
Papa, what do we do?

493
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,720
You gotta turn around, papa.

494
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,610
I can't go back to sona. I can't.

495
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,700
I don't care what he says.

496
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,860
He's a convict! he's a piece of garbage.

497
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,620
I don't know anything about this Michael Scofield guy.

498
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,750
General.

499
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,220
Here is everything we have on the escaped prisoners.

500
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,420
You don't know Michael Scofield, is that right, jorge?

501
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,670
Yes.

502
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,400
You sure you don't want to ange your story, Fernando?

506
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,230
This should help make you a decent brace.

507
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,260
Thank you.

509
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,640
Should be able to see them coming from up here.

510
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,440
You know, Linc...

511
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,360
You did great.

512
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,400
Thanks.

513
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,590
I just want lj back, you know?

514
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,430
It's just a matter of time.

515
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah.

516
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,010
Considering I don't have

517
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,380
A pony in this race...

520
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,900
After what you did to us?

521
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,320
What you did to my dad?

522
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,410
No.

523
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,530
I was gonna kill you at the beach,

524
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,740
But I didn't want to do anything that was gonna get us caught.

525
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,800
You shot my dad in the back. I'm gonna give you

526
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,200
The courtesy you never gave him.

527
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,800
Turn around.

528
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,140
Turn around.

530
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,370
I was told to choose between your family and mine.

531
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,580
That was my option.

532
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,110
I chose mine.

533
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,980
Go to hell.

534
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,960
Linc, you don't have to do this.

535
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,370
Mahone!

536
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,410
Hey! my truck!

537
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,660
Stop!

538
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,150
What are we gonna do now?

1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,230
Previous on Prison Break

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,590

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,590
you have a warrant out for your arrest

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,590
you are not going anywhere

37
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,280
everything's dark

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,880
stop, or we'll shoot

45
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,170
stop

46
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,710
stop

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,250
stop

51
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,030
stop

62
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,370
we have an escape in progress

63
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,500
we have an escape

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,540

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,660
no other prisoners have been found

70
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,710
bring them inside

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,210

75
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,010
have someone drag in

76
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,500

77
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,110
hurry it up

146
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,730
nothing

147
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,750
you're sure?

148
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,950
absolutely

149
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,160

150
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,530

151
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,640
absolutely

152
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,100
it's empty

158
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,950
did you finish the count?

159
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,980
just finishing now, sir

160
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,720
sir... we are four short

168
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,270
faster. we're losing them

170
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,300
he just started shouting

171
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,130
to get off the bus

175
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,960
how would you describe the suspect?

176
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,560
well, he was tall...

177
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,700
more than six feet

178
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,770
what nationality?

179
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,890
american

180
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,100
he spoke English

182
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,340
if you saw him, would you recognize him?

183
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,290
yes, of course

206
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,680
come on. let's go

259
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,290
over here

260
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,730
towards the beach

261
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,980
i could've sworn

262
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,990
they were headed in this direction

263
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,610
give me the binoculars

264
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,100
do you see any boats?

265
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,620
not a one

266
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,550
...where the hell are they?

272
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,660
i want men covering five kilometers

273
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,330
both east and west and check-points

274
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,370
on all coastal roads--

275
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,170
every vehicle is to be searched

276
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,450
contact the general...

277
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,340
i need more men sent to me at once

330
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,650
What kind of man doesn't

331
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,250
take care of his family?

332
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,200
Not a good one.

333
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,080
Please let me go...

334
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,070
they are waiting on me.

360
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,660
He's done

361
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,290
What about him?

362
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,670
He's even worse off.

409
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,010
What the hell is he still doing here?

410
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,320
Unless it's for murder

411
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,770
get him out of here!

503
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,120
What is this?

504
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,530
What is this?

518
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,950
I guess this is where we say goodbay

519
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,690
Think I am going to let you just walk out of here?

529
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,800
Linc, think about what you are doing
