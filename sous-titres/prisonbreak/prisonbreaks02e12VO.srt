<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:05,886
Listen, why don't I just give you
half the money we call it a day?

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:07,241
All right, 60/40.

4
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:09,620
<i>You thieving son of a bitch!</i>

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,778
<i>You better get down on your knees
and pray to god that I don't find you.</i>

6
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,613
<i>Because if I do, mark my words,</i>

7
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:17,182
<i>I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.</i>

8
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,633
- Mr. Bellick?
- Yeah?

9
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:21,010
Do you mind answering
a few more questions?

10
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:23,922
<i>We have a lead as to where Burrows
will be meeting up with his brother.</i>

11
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,000
<i>It's a place he referred to as
"Bolshoi Booze."</i>

12
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,139
They're numbers.

13
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,337
<i>Plug 'em into your GPS</i>

14
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:30,971
<i>they'll take you to a spot
in the New Mexico desert.</i>

15
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,403
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby, you ready to go?

16
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:39,523
What do we do now?

17
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,614
<i>She told you anything?</i>

18
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,607
- Not yet.
- Then kill her.

19
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:48,090
Well, she knows something.

20
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,820
You disobey me, you are done!

21
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:51,398
<i>Put her in the ground, Paul!</i>

22
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,804
You're going to die,

23
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:55,885
and all you had to do
was tell me what your father gave you.

24
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,458
Go to hell.

25
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:05,391
The plane's gonna stop
at the seven-mile marker,

26
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,087
route 4 at sunset.

27
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:09,193
We got to go.

28
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:10,893
- I brought someone.
- Dad?

29
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:14,276
We met before.

30
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,041
It was you.

31
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:21,524
Go easy, son.

32
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,029
Stay away from me.

33
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,717
- What the hell's going on?
- I know him.

34
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,792
What do you mean you know him?
That's impossible.

35
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,431
I know him. I know this man!

36
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:41,959
Maybe that's far enough.

37
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,268
This doesn't concern you.

38
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:44,848
What the hell's going on, dad?

39
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:52,254
After mom died...

40
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:54,986
you were in juvie.

41
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,637
They put me with this...

42
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:00,833
this foster father

43
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:02,830
down on Pershing avenue.

44
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:09,819
He punished me, locked me up.

45
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,964
If you leave someone
alone in the dark for that long,

46
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:17,354
their eyes start to adjust.

47
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:20,035
You start to see things,

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,142
no matter how small,

49
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:27,781
because if they exist,
they can help you.

50
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:33,176
Help you do the only thing
you want to do...

51
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,342
when you're alone in the dark:

52
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,446
get out.

53
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,995
Sorry, man. I thought you'd left.

54
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,841
No, still here. Here I am.

55
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,804
Yeah, it's just that a couple of guests

56
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,981
are complaining
about the volume of your TV.

57
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,717
Oh, sorry, I fell asleep.

58
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,492
I must have hit the remote.

59
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,360
I'll take care of it.
Thanks. Sorry. Thanks.

60
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:57,497
Great.

61
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,512
So could you do that for me now, please,

62
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,918
So it's taken care of?

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,486
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

64
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,900
Taken care of.

65
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:21,117
Is... everything okay
in your bathroom?

66
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,583
Excuse me?

67
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,567
Your bathroom.
There's a noise coming from it.

68
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,709
Yeah, my daughter thinks
bath time is playtime.

69
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:32,991
I will clean it up.
Scout's honor. Sorry.

70
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,611
All right.

71
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,459
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah, you, too.

72
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:53,127
- Please wait.
- He did this to you?

73
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,435
He did this to you?

74
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,576
Did he did this to you?

75
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:13,950
How could you do that
to another human being

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,069
with your own hands?

77
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,856
It's okay. You're safe now.

78
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:37,003
He's not going to hurt you anymore.

79
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,121
Come on.

80
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,665
Come with me and don't look back.

81
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:16,497
It's gonna be all right.

2x12 - Disconnect

84
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,984
Six months.

85
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,547
Six months I was in that place.

86
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:16,205
Where were you?

87
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,750
How long did you know?

88
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:21,653
I found you as soon as I could.
The state kept moving you around.

89
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,059
Then you went away again, right?

90
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,533
You don't think it killed me
to leave you like that?

91
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:26,994
To leave in the first place?

92
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,489
Since the beginning, I was the problem.

93
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,606
Since day one.

94
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,524
Your lives are what they are
because of me.

95
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:34,268
Yes, Linc told me about the company.

96
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,005
Apparently,
you were some kind of analyst.

97
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:37,888
That's the job you chose
over your family.

98
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:40,747
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I thought I was protecting you.

99
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:42,229
From what, dad, from who?

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,406
The company had enemies!

101
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,124
I was important to the company.

102
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:47,472
I became a target.

103
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:50,108
Easiest way to get to me
would be to get to you!

104
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:52,874
I left as soon as I realized
how corrupt it all was.

105
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:56,203
- How they were buying the government...
- You could have come back at any time!

106
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,339
No, I couldn't!

107
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,722
Turning on the company

108
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,706
put me and you at even greater risk.

109
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:03,737
I had to stay away.

110
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:06,954
We were your sons!

111
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:09,123
And you still are, Michael.

112
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,204
We can fix this.

113
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,657
I came back so that we could fix this.

114
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,184
This can never be fixed.

115
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,427
There's a tape.

116
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,565
Gives us everything we need.

117
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,624
Linc will be set free if we find it.

118
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,881
You're not gonna believe
who he thinks has it.

119
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:35,632
Who?

120
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,044
Sara.

121
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,452
Yes... tall and slender,

122
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,089
brown hair, brown eyes.

123
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:48,069
She'd be pretty banged up.

124
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:51,452
<i>No one matching that description
has been brought into the E.R.</i>

125
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:57,812
Kellerman.

126
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:00,000
No report on Sara Tancredi?

127
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:02,545
She's dead.
I'm dealing with the body right now.

128
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,085
You must be relieved that it's over.

129
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:07,663
Yeah, I got to go.

130
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:10,514
<i>One more thing: confirmation.</i>

131
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,666
I need a photo of the body
before disposal.

132
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:16,375
<i>Take one with your phone
and send it to me and I'll...</i>

133
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,041
Not a good time right now, all right?

134
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,272
Paul, take a breath,

135
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:25,180
then take the picture.

136
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,594
I'm waiting.

137
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,901
"The trail led
to a very dangerous place.

138
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:41,872
"Now, Arvid knew that,

139
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:44,671
"but he held tightly
onto the dragon's leash anyway,

140
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:47,061
"as the creature ran
into the everdark forest,

141
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,006
pulling the young boy behind him."

142
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,005
Why didn't he just let go of the leash?

143
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,533
Well, because he loved the dragon.

144
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,096
Now, when you love someone,

145
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:59,479
you'll do anything to hold onto them.

146
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:03,218
Anything to keep them safe and happy.

147
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:05,636
Is that why we're camping?

148
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,161
Yep. So we can all be together.

149
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,638
I'm happy.

150
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:16,140
I'm happy, too.

151
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,310
Here you go.

152
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:41,099
Well, it's all working out, huh?

153
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:42,948
Don't say that.

154
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:59,108
You know, this moment,
right here, right now,

155
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:02,444
it's all worth it.

156
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,023
I love you.

157
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,873
I love you, too.

158
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,334
That's old.

159
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,154
The kids are bigger now.

160
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,811
Sorry. I was just...

161
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:44,523
getting bored out of your wits
'cause you been waiting so long.

162
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,242
Really sorry about all this.

163
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,543
We don't get a whole bunch
of homicides out here,

164
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,452
and, well,
we're trying to play catch-up.

165
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:52,788
Please, have a seat.

166
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:57,480
I'm real sorry about your friend.

167
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,004
Sick world out there.

168
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,444
Ain't that the truth?

169
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:05,683
So you guys out here in Kansas together?

170
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:06,771
Yeah. That's right.

171
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:08,409
Doing what?

172
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:10,959
Well, you know, just seeing the sights.

173
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,564
You left Chicago to see the sights
in Tribune, Kansas?

174
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,045
Last time I checked,
a man could go where he wanted.

175
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,105
Mr. Bellick...

176
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,477
Brad.

177
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:23,659
Brad. I don't really care
what you were doing out here.

178
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,807
We're both in law enforcement.

179
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,982
We can each sniff out
a perp like a hot fart.

180
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,054
Pardon my French.

181
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,788
We both know
you're not a criminal, so...

182
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:37,939
I don't care if you boys were out here
whoopin' it without your wives

183
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,696
or... going Brokeback.

184
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:42,910
What?

185
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,605
Hell, no.

186
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,409
My point is,
I don't care what you were doing.

187
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:49,349
I just need to know
where you were doing it

188
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,121
and who you might have
crossed paths with

189
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:53,509
so I can find out
who carved up Mr. Geary.

190
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,839
Geary and I got a lead

191
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:04,185
that one of the Fox River Eight
was in town.

192
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,190
Which one?

193
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,134
Theodore Bagwell.

194
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:11,674
The man who did
all those horrible things to teenagers?

195
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:12,790
That's him.

196
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,893
We were going to bring him in
for the reward money,

197
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,357
but we couldn't get a handle on him.

198
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,824
Geary and I split up,
figured we didn't have a shot, but...

199
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:19,866
But what?

200
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:21,530
Well, after what happened,

201
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,628
I'm starting to think maybe Geary
ran into old Bagwell after all.

202
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,152
Right here in Tribune?

203
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,391
Now, Brad, do you think
you could answer some questions

204
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,893
that might help us

205
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:35,646
track down Theodore Bagwell?

206
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,171
I'd be indebted.

207
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:40,798
I'll do whatever I can
to help you nail that son of a bitch.

208
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:43,093
You think Sara has this tape?

209
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,422
Government does.

210
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:49,154
I just saw her yesterday.
If she does have anything,

211
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,714
she doesn't know.

212
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,437
Well, where is she now?

213
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,410
I don't know.

214
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:56,557
Any way you can get in touch with her?

215
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,702
We brought cell phones.
I could call her.

216
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,416
Please, please, please, bro,

217
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,185
call her from Panama. Please.

218
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,434
We got less than two hours.

219
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:05,821
I got to make the flight.

220
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:11,089
What?

221
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:16,588
Run.

222
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:17,729
Run!

223
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,172
Where's this car you keep talking about?

224
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,578
It's over the ridge.

225
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:29,650
Give me that. You guys head for the car!

226
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,311
Go!

227
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:40,889
Come on! Go!

228
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,093
Go back for him!

229
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:01,927
Come on, dad.

230
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,089
We made it! Son of a bitch! We made it!

231
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:35,449
Sucre, get us to a hospital.

232
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,393
Out here?
Where the hell am I going to find...?

233
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,347
Just get us to a hospital, please!

234
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,218
Don't worry. You're going to make it.

235
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:44,144
It's bile.

236
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:45,879
He got me clean through.

237
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,993
You're going to be okay!
Just... hold on.

238
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:50,795
Listen to me,

239
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,124
both of you.

240
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,382
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,684
I wish I had never left.

242
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:02,004
Don't talk. Just breathe.

243
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,133
Okay, so do you want a PB & B?

244
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:12,553
Not really.

245
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:14,286
My tummy hurts.

246
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:18,335
Where's her knapsack?

247
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,396
Her what?

248
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,124
Her knapsack. Her medicine's in it.

249
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,256
I don't know, baby.
I just grabbed her and ran.

250
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:26,719
She needs that medicine.

251
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:28,532
She can't go two days without it.

252
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:30,510
Yeah, I know. I'm her father, okay?

253
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,130
Where is it?

254
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,133
Baby. Baby, look. Calm down.

255
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:36,251
What are you looking for?

256
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,755
Just tell me what it is,
and I'll go ahead and get it, okay?

257
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,797
Her prescription.

258
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:44,534
It's a backup. I keep an extra, in case.

259
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:52,223
So all we need to do is find a pharmacy.

260
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:57,857
Don't worry.

261
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:01,048
Hey, looks like we're going on a ride,
sweet pea.

262
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:03,667
Look, we nail Bagwell,

263
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,771
he might still have some
of Geary's things on him,

264
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,048
like his backpack,
which has his personal stuff in it.

265
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:10,090
I know his wife would love to have it.

266
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,124
If we find Bagwell,
you can give it to her personally.

267
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:14,106
Thanks.

268
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:17,002
It's the least I can do
considering how you're helping me out.

269
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:20,070
Though some of the guys
on the force are concerned about...

270
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,842
What are they concerned about?

271
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,262
Nothing...

272
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,746
But you know what?
If you tell me what you know,

273
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:27,801
we'll track down Bagwell,

274
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,685
we'll get Geary's effects
back to his family,

275
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:32,902
I'll make sure that everybody involved
knows that your help was invaluable.

276
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,816
I'll even recommend
that you get most of,

277
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:36,919
if not all of, that reward money.

278
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:41,233
What is it exactly that the guys
on the force were concerned about?

279
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:44,785
Some of them thought

280
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:47,432
that you weren't totally upfront
about your head injury.

281
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:48,743
I mean, to be fair,

282
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:50,278
it does seem a little off

283
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:53,450
that you didn't see the guy
who hit you smack-dab on the forehead.

284
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,066
You got me.

285
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:05,343
Geary and me had a little dustup
over how to go about finding Bagwell.

286
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:08,347
It got physical, and he hit me.

287
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:10,423
The two of us, we fought like brothers.

288
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,329
I didn't want
to rat him out to the cops.

289
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,979
After the fight, we split up.

290
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,993
And then...

291
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:23,764
Well, you know what happened to him.

292
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,006
I just wish to hell
we'd never fought, you know?

293
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,681
Maybe then he'd still be...

294
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,825
Brad, you can't blame yourself.

295
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,309
Why don't we refocus our energy

296
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:41,960
on finding the man
who killed your friend?

297
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,519
That's what Roy would've wanted.

298
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,450
Where are you at, baby?

299
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,182
Insurance card?

300
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:13,609
No, I don't have insurance.

301
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,705
You're paying for Dexamethasone
without insurance?

302
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,832
You got medicaid, medicare or something?

303
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:23,155
Nope. I'll just pay cash.

304
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,927
It's $125.

305
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,361
Excuse me?

306
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,270
Excuse me?

307
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,532
Sorry.

308
00:21:55,341 --> 00:21:57,186
Sorry I don't have anything smaller.

309
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,124
I have to go to the back
to get change for $100.

310
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:03,973
So... I'll be right back.

311
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:18,741
- Right there! Hospital!
- I see it. I see it.

312
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,877
Just get us there.

313
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:21,206
No, you'll be caught.

314
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:22,670
Then we'll be caught.

315
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,463
I'm not gonna let you die.

316
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:27,160
Then listen to me.

317
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:29,684
You find Sara Tancredi.

318
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:32,400
She can end this.

319
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,329
It's up to you now.

320
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:50,108
Yeah, I want an alarm out
on a dark blue sedan.

321
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:52,419
License: AE9268.

322
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,013
40 miles southeast of Los Cruces.

323
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:57,016
Do it now.

324
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,159
Oh, come on!

325
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:04,799
What?

326
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:08,112
What hospital?

327
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,151
He came in with a bad GSW.

328
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:15,654
Docs called us in.

329
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,944
He's in here.

330
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:19,275
We ran his name.

331
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:22,590
Came back with two federal
drug smuggling warrants out on him.

332
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:26,493
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

333
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:32,504
I got some information the feds want...

334
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,470
about Michael Scofield.

335
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:41,580
Like where he's catching a ride.

336
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:44,104
And where would that be?

337
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,116
It's not just the "where"

338
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,134
but the "when."

339
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,609
That "when" is coming up soon.

340
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,473
But I want to cut a deal first.

341
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,333
Give us a minute.

342
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:13,850
Anything you want to say?

343
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:17,334
One day...

344
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,549
that's all we had.

345
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,502
Back then,

346
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:48,231
when things were at their worst...

347
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:53,086
there were days I thought
I'd never see the sun again.

348
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,584
But he saved my life.

349
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:03,145
I just wish he could have let us be
a part of his.

350
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:21,258
I'll tell him.

351
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:27,967
Here's the deal.

352
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,527
All charges dropped

353
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:31,228
and the government
picks up medical costs

354
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:32,779
until you're fit to be deported,

355
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:35,813
All contingent upon your information
being accurate.

356
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:39,210
Where's Scofield?

357
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:41,829
No deportation.

358
00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:43,423
I want citizenship.

359
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:46,062
Citizenship?

360
00:25:47,102 --> 00:25:48,355
A little incentive,

361
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:50,011
and I want it in writing.

362
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:53,570
I'm so tired of playing games.

363
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,534
Well, start typing.

364
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:03,965
No external pacemaker.

365
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:06,893
Oh, this is a good one:

366
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,450
no morphine drip.

367
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:11,656
- What are you doing?
- FBI. Out! Out.

368
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:14,622
What the hell are you doing?

369
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,252
Giving you a little incentive.

370
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:18,448
Come on!

371
00:26:18,602 --> 00:26:19,786
Come on, you son of a...

372
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,269
And they found nothing?

373
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:23,533
Okay, thanks.

374
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:26,377
Well, your instincts are great, Brad,

375
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:29,391
but the precinct actually sent a unit
over to Hollander's house today.

376
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:32,654
An anonymous caller said they saw
an intruder but no one was there.

377
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:34,021
Damn it.

378
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,309
If you knew about Bagwell and Hollander,

379
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,557
why didn't you just
head over there yourself?

380
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,753
We couldn't find the house.

381
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:43,541
Really?

382
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:44,716
It's listed.

383
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:52,748
Excuse me.

384
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:01,646
Thank you.

385
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:04,747
Everything okay?

386
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:07,790
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

387
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,397
Brad, have you ever been
to the Fauntleroy hotel?

388
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,740
- It's about 15 minutes from here.
- Never heard of it.

389
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,435
Well, that's strange,

390
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,780
'cause they found this receipt
in Geary's hotel room.

391
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,260
It's from your credit card.

392
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:26,301
I don't know how that got there.

393
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:33,754
I think you're being evasive.

394
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:37,111
You should tell me the truth,
Mr. Bellick.

395
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:38,691
What happened to "Brad"?

396
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,509
About seven years ago,
I got my first homicide case...

397
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:43,587
a woman, pretty.

398
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,812
She was brutally attacked.

399
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,757
Animal boyfriend left her for dead,

400
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:49,247
but she was still breathing... barely.

401
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:52,751
But she punched into her cell phone

402
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:55,921
the killer's number,
so she solved the crime for us.

403
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:58,756
When we found the receipt, Brad,

404
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:01,535
it was in Geary's hand,
his finger pointing to your name.

405
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,942
With his last ounce of strength,

406
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,144
- he told us you killed him.
- Okay, listen.

407
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,858
Geary and I found Bagwell

408
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:07,976
at Hollander's house.

409
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:09,344
We roughed him up

410
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:11,786
till he told us where he'd hid
the five million bucks

411
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:13,462
we knew he dug up in Utah.

412
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:14,813
When we found the money,

413
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,373
Geary double-crossed me.

414
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,486
He hit me in the head and took the cash.

415
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:20,398
I had nothing to do with Geary's death.

416
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:21,573
You hear what I'm saying?

417
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,892
I'm the victim here,

418
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:24,382
not that son of a bitch!

419
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:36,930
Come on, come on, come on.

420
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:39,389
Where are you at, baby?

421
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,054
Hey... could you hurry it up?

422
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,906
It's just it's getting really late.
I got to get home.

423
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,014
Here you go.

424
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,709
And... that's $20,

425
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:01,367
$40, $50,

426
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:03,393
and $20 is $70.

427
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,838
One, two, three,

428
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:06,289
four...

429
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:08,620
five... seventy-five.

430
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:25,330
You got to be kidding me.

431
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:36,242
Ma'am.

432
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:38,843
Afternoon, officer.

433
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,107
Do you have any ID with you?

434
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:46,743
I walked over here,
so I didn't carry anything with me.

435
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:49,052
Did you? Where'd you walk from?

436
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:52,224
Is there a problem, officer?

437
00:29:52,802 --> 00:29:55,359
There's only a problem
if you make one, Ms. Franklin.

438
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:57,948
You want to tell us
where your husband is?

439
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:01,875
I don't know.

440
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:05,072
Place your hands behind your back,
please, ma'am.

441
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:17,618
Baby, I'm so sorry.

442
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:35,813
Oh, my God.

443
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,107
Where's mommy?

444
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:43,319
Mommy,

445
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:45,630
mommy is going to meet us later. Okay?

446
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,391
<i>Where's the photo?</i>

447
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,167
I don't want terminology
from the Cover Your Ass handbook, Paul.

448
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:01,862
What happened?

449
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:04,026
There were unforeseen circumstances,

450
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,521
- things that could not be predicted.
- Where's Sara?

451
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:10,623
She's gone, isn't she?

452
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:17,146
Yes, she got away,

453
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:18,918
<i>but there's no way...</i>

454
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,474
I'm not going to let you die.

455
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,166
I love you.

456
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:45,750
You know that, don't you?

457
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:02,451
Too many.

458
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:06,974
Too many people died
because I wanted you to be free.

459
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:10,358
You couldn't have known, Michael.

460
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,575
You couldn't have known it...

461
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,990
would have ended up like this.

462
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,435
But it did.

463
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:19,769
They wanted him.

464
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,725
They wanted him in the ground,

465
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:25,268
and they got their wish.

466
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,251
This thing is not going to end here,
Michael.

467
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:32,405
I know.

468
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,848
It's going to keep spreading.

469
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,500
Their hands are going to get
more and more bloody.

470
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,098
Well, the question is,

471
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,120
is the blood on their hands...

472
00:33:44,026 --> 00:33:45,162
or ours?

473
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,236
I'm sorry, guys.

474
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:55,776
We got to go.

475
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:16,932
Get back on with border patrol.

476
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,064
Call the Navy reserve air station
in Dallas.

477
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:20,335
They've got planes on alert.

478
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:23,512
We need an intercept of a white,
single engine A-36 Beech

479
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,841
heading toward the border.

480
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,669
Call Mexico, get clearance
for an international pursuit.

481
00:34:27,977 --> 00:34:30,669
Tell them if they got to take
the plane down, just do it.

482
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,172
Come on, guys!

483
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:18,883
Guys, come on.

484
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:20,289
Come on, guys.

485
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,668
What?

486
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:28,092
We're staying.

487
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:37,066
Michael, this is
what we've been waiting for.

488
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:39,615
Maybe we'll see you down there
somewhere.

489
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:43,304
I can't talk you out of this one, can I?

490
00:35:51,548 --> 00:35:52,916
Well, I hope so.

491
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:54,765
Be good.

492
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:56,926
Thank you, Michael.

493
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:58,486
Thank you for everything.

494
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,289
Take care of him, all right?

495
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,387
I will.

496
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,319
Fly safe, Papi.

497
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:14,654
Give 'em hell.

498
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,214
Panama would've been good.

499
00:36:34,252 --> 00:36:35,592
Are you ready for this?

500
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:38,242
- Been waiting years.
- Good to hear it.

501
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,874
'Cause today is the day we stop running.

502
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:57,200
- What now?
- We go back to the car.

503
00:36:57,296 --> 00:37:00,318
I drive to a border town,
find a cell phone signal.

504
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:02,128
Call Sara.

505
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,192
Where the hell are those jets?!

506
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:28,865
You hear that?

507
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:34,260
Pull over.

508
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,653
They're going after Sucre.

509
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,716
They're gonna take him down.

510
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,850
How'd they find out?

511
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:55,102
I don't know.

512
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,762
I want to know what's going on.

513
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,137
If you could've arrested me,
you would've already done it.

514
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:38,596
- I'm out of here.
- Not really an option for you.

515
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:40,761
What do you got, a receipt?
He left it in his pocket.

516
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,021
A fight? Big deal.

517
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,356
I got ten pals in Chicago

518
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:45,473
tell you Geary
and I threw down once a month.

519
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:48,478
You're right.
Any of those things on their own,

520
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:49,634
probably not enough.

521
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:50,905
But when you add this...

522
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:53,141
What the hell's that?

523
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:55,694
You left a message for Mr. Geary.

524
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:59,643
<i>You thieving son of a bitch,</i>

525
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:02,620
<i>you better get down on your knees
and pray God that I don't find you!</i>

526
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,853
<i>Because if I do, mark my words:</i>

527
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,775
<i>I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.</i>

528
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:12,184
You want to hear it again?

529
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,276
Now at this juncture, Brad,

530
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:19,432
things will go a whole lot easier
for you if you admit to the crime.

531
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:23,526
Now you listen to me,
you manipulative little bitch.

532
00:39:24,586 --> 00:39:26,181
I did not kill Roy Geary!

533
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,792
You understand what I'm telling you!

534
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:28,986
Bagwell set me up!

535
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:31,006
Get your hands off of me!

536
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,123
Bradley Bellick,

537
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:34,648
you are under arrest for the
first-degree murder of Roy Geary.

538
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:36,047
You have a right to remain silent.

539
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:38,493
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

540
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:41,222
You have a right to talk to a lawyer
and have him present with you

541
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,040
when being questioned.
If you cannot hire an attorney...

542
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:55,646
<i>President Reynolds' office.</i>

543
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:56,988
This is agent Paul Kellerman.

544
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,694
I need to speak with the President
right now, please.

545
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,335
<i>I'm sorry, this administration
isn't familiar with an agent Kellerman.</i>

546
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:04,587
June, it's me.

547
00:40:04,606 --> 00:40:06,692
I need to speak with Caroline, now.

548
00:40:08,382 --> 00:40:09,518
If you don't put me through,

549
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:12,139
I'll make certain that the President
knows that you were the one

550
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:14,655
who did not allow me to give her
some capital information.

551
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,888
Now.

552
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:19,980
<i>I'm sorry, this administration
isn't familiar with an agent...</i>

553
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,359
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

554
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:37,402
Bill, don't do this.

555
00:40:38,211 --> 00:40:41,096
<i>I've dedicated my life
to this country, to Caroline.</i>

556
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,305
<i>Everything I have, I give.</i>

557
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:44,730
Every photo,

558
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,656
every file. Get rid of it all.

559
00:40:47,484 --> 00:40:48,621
Make him a ghost.

560
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,335
<i>I've been a perfect soldier.</i>

561
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:52,547
<i>I've never asked
anything of you, ever.</i>

562
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:55,474
<i>But I'm asking now.</i>

563
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,583
<i>Bill, don't do this.</i>

564
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,136
I don't see him.

565
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:06,272
Trust me,

566
00:41:06,445 --> 00:41:08,005
we haven't lost him yet.

567
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:20,542
- Stop the car.
- What?

568
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,333
We got to stop the car.

569
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:30,450
That's a radio tower over there.

570
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,713
It must be picking up
some kind of analog signal.

571
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:35,371
We got to get closer.

572
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,990
Turn around.

573
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,168
What about your friend back there?

574
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:40,613
If we're gonna go down,

575
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:43,188
might as well go down swinging.

576
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:56,038
Come on, come on, come on!

577
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:02,806
We are in business.

578
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:04,116
It's going through.

579
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:07,371
Come on, Sara, pick up.

580
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:06,600
