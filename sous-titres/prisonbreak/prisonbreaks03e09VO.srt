1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:04,218
- Previously on Prison Break.
- Sona's a one-way street.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,902
What goes in...

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:08,772
- never comes out.
- They got me and Sara.

4
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:12,169
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
Are we clear?

5
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:14,994
I'll tell you the plan when
you tell me who you are.

6
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:16,917
- I'm a fisherman.
- Really?

7
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:20,403
- My life is in your hands.
- How's LJ? How's Sara?

8
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:23,135
She's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.

9
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:24,257
Sofia Lugo.

10
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:26,090
I'm James
Whistler's girlfriend.

11
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:29,205
You are breaking out of this prison,
Mr. Scofield,

12
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,916
- and you're taking me with you.
- Four more days.

13
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:35,071
If I'm out of here by then,
I can still do it.

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,351
There have been two escape
attempts in the past two days.

15
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,040
Say good-bye to Sona,
Mr. Scofield.

16
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:11,982
Right there. Leave us.

17
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,291
My predecessor,
Colonel Escamilla,

18
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:19,071
wasn't an effective leader.
He's been replaced.

19
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,173
I am General Zavala. Sit.

20
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:29,012
- A drink of water?
- With all due respect, General,

21
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,602
I had nothing to do with
what happened here today.

22
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:34,141
I always conduct a
thorough investigation,

23
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,730
and there are too many
unanswered questions here.

24
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:40,072
It is my job to
find those answers.

25
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,380
If you help me do my job,
I'll help you.

26
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,303
The helicopters.

27
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:47,073
You alone couldn't be
responsible for that.

28
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:49,713
You certainly weren't flying
a helicopter, were you?

29
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:50,773
- No.
- Who was?

30
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:52,581
- I don't know.
- But you know who sent them.

31
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,351
- No.
- Again, be advised--

32
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:58,081
telling the truth is
in your best interest.

33
00:01:58,407 --> 00:01:59,580
I am.

34
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,410
Let's go for a walk.

35
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,481
I understand your fears,

36
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,683
but the Republic of Panama cannot
allow this sort of activity.

37
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:14,223
If you wish to talk,
now is the time.

38
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,653
I would...

39
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,270
if there was anything
left to say.

40
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:21,813
Then you give me no choice.
This way.

41
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:28,232
This isn't good.
They're putting him in the hot box.

42
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:31,100
Things are gonna get
much harder for you.

43
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,103
There's no way to win.
You must cooperate.

44
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:38,741
Confess to this escape and
face your punishment by law,

45
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:43,500
or face a far greater punishment
in the Panama sun. It's up to you.

46
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:50,191
He's done. He's finished.

47
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:07,192
Synch: Travis - Transcript: Raceman

48
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,961
I hope my brother's all right.

49
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,440
- Does it hurt?
- It's fine.

50
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,602
I'm gonna get to the prison.

51
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,133
I was watching the news
in the waiting room.

52
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,293
They identified a few bodies, but...
it wasn't them.

53
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:06,531
I'll find out when I get there.
You want to come?

54
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:07,842
I don't, I don't know.

55
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:10,670
After everything that's happened,
I don't know what to think anymore.

56
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:12,190
What more is there
to think about?

57
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:15,062
James has an answer for everything,
and nothing ever makes sense.

58
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,541
You need to stop asking questions
and just look at the facts.

59
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:19,513
I wanted to believe
everything he was saying,

60
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,003
and I still want
him to get out.

61
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:24,011
I want him out as well.

62
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:27,020
Trust me, I've been working
on this every single day.

63
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:30,492
Lincoln, I really appreciate
everything you have done.

64
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,681
You saved my life.
You didn't have to help me like that.

65
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:36,462
Yeah. I did.

66
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:43,752
Get in the car.

67
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:44,871
Come on.

68
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:58,323
Everywhere I go, there you are.

69
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,313
Go home, Sofia.

70
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:18,750
Part of me wanted to drive
right past this gate, Alex.

71
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:21,041
You don't deserve to be here.

72
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,270
Actually, if you take all
things into consideration...

73
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,270
I do.

74
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,913
- Thank you.
- Wait.

75
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,263
Don't.

76
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:44,481
My father worked in
a mine for 30 years,

77
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:47,160
he took this into work
with him every day.

78
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,632
Kept him safe till
the day he retired.

79
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:52,791
Then he gave it to me.

80
00:05:56,137 --> 00:06:00,291
- I can't take this.
- Give it back when you get out.

81
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,971
- Take care of yourself, Alex.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,731
What? You ain't got the
guts to do it yourself?

83
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:46,570
Hey.

84
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,150
This is for you,
so shut up before I change my mind.

85
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,453
After yesterday,
you may be doubting my ability to

86
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,890
make good on our agreement.
I need to keep you motivated.

87
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:57,370
You have one minute.

88
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,462
Dad!

89
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:10,331
LJ. LJ, thank God you're alive.

90
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,553
No, forget about it.
There's nothing you can do.

91
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,172
- There's always something.
- No, Dad.

92
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:25,542
These guys are thorough.
They follow you everywhere. Trust me.

93
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:30,670
That bitch is crazy.

94
00:07:30,956 --> 00:07:32,502
She cut Sara's head off.

95
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:34,302
I was there.

96
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:38,122
- I closed my eyes, but I heard it.
- You listen to me.

97
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:40,473
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, all right?

98
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,631
The next time you see me,
don't take your eyes off me.

99
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,372
I'll tell you what to do.
All right?

100
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,243
Minute's up.

101
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:50,611
Me and your uncle,
we know what we're doing.

102
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:52,481
We're gonna get
you out of this.

103
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,713
- I love you.
- I love you, Dad.

104
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,093
Looks like things
didn't go so well.

105
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,303
- You should be gone.
- So should you.

106
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:27,942
What happened?

107
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:30,962
It's still happening.

108
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:34,213
I feel bad for Michael,
but we have a way without him.

109
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:35,851
You should get some rest.

110
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:37,341
What's the way?

111
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,500
I'll rest. I'll rest.
I'll rest when I'm out.

112
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:44,980
I won't go without you.
You have my word. Now get some rest.

113
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:57,201
You see Scofield out
in that redneck sauna?

114
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,841
Let's see if he has the tattoo
to get out of that one.

115
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:01,550
You were in on it, right?

116
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:03,622
I see you guys lurking
around Lechero.

117
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,740
Scofield's gotta have
a plan to escape.

118
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:09,173
- If so, I know none of it.
- Yeah, I bet you don't.

119
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:14,383
Whoa. Too many cocktails
out on the lido deck.

120
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,353
Here comes trouble.

121
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:23,523
- Señor Criada, clean it up.
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.

122
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:26,873
You heard what I said.
I told you to do something. Now do it.

123
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,602
Cleaning up chunks ain't in
my job description anymore.

124
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:32,381
Oh, things changed.
You see, you answer to us now.

125
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:35,581
Hey, caveman, you don't scare me.
Go bug someone else.

126
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:15,743
Jorge!

127
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,321
What are you doing here?

128
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:23,382
I have a special delivery.
I need to get it in real quick.

129
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:26,341
- How much?
- I gave you ten grand.

130
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,531
Ten grand was the last one.
How much for this one?

131
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,451
- No grand.
- Then no thanks.

132
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,403
I think you might...

133
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:39,332
want to reconsider.

134
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,820
Take this water
to the prisoner.

135
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,010
Why should I?
He doesn't deserve it.

136
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:52,592
I'll do it.

137
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,983
Hi, brother. Remember me?

138
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:14,081
- This isn't gonna work.
- Come on, papi, drink this.

139
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,662
Don't let anything
happen to LJ, okay?

140
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:20,671
It's okay. He's doing much
better than you. Come on.

141
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:22,781
Drink this. You need it.

142
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,671
I'm sorry about Sara.

143
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,140
I'm gonna try to sneak more into
the prison next time, okay?

144
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,635
- I want you to quit.
- I can't.

145
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:45,876
- We all have to quit sometime.
- I'm not gonna.

146
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:48,981
You're here in a chicken coop--
you need all the help you can get.

147
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,381
Don't need your help.
Just go, and don't look back.

148
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:53,123
Not after everything
you've done for me.

149
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,752
Just go. Go.

150
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:11,651
So you tried to catch a
flight out of here yesterday?

151
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:14,901
- I had to do what I had to do.
- Yeah, but you went back on our deal.

152
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,101
I was saving my own ass. I'm sure
you're familiar with the strategy.

153
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,311
Now, you watch it.
I'm still boss here.

154
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,001
Who cares about who's boss?

155
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:25,063
Do you want to get out of here,
or do you want to keep talking about it?

156
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,621
It's okay.
We just need to brace it.

157
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:34,351
No. We need the engineer.
Move it.

158
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:37,053
Let's get out of here
before Sammy gets back.

159
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:58,131
98 down the shade, 125 in the box.
Let's go inside.

160
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,291
We'll have a chat in
the air conditioning.

161
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:04,341
Tomorrow is going to be hotter,
the next day, even hotter.

162
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:08,112
- The day after that, you'll be dead.
- You don't understand.

163
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:13,622
- If I thought you could help me...
- I can.

164
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:17,011
You're unaware of the influence
I have in this province.

165
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:21,123
You'd rather I be your ally
than your enemy, wouldn't you?

166
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:23,043
You don't know these people.

167
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:27,763
We can't stop them--
not you, not me.

168
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:34,681
There was a man-- a drug kingpin--
the most powerful man in Panama.

169
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:39,582
A ruthless killer with an army
of thugs and thieves behind him.

170
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:43,312
He killed judges and policemen,
anyone who stood in his way.

171
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,662
They said he couldn't be stopped either,
but now

172
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:48,342
Lechero is in prison,
and I'm in power.

173
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:52,590
I decide whose life is at stake,
and right now, it is yours.

174
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,033
From the moment I got here...

175
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:02,630
I've been planning my escape.

176
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:12,281
- He's talking.
- How do you know?

177
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:15,441
You can't get out of
the box any other way.

178
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,451
The people who sent
the helicopters,

179
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:38,570
they're the same people
who framed my brother

180
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:40,452
back in the U.S.,

181
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:44,873
the same people who
wanted me here in Sona.

182
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,942
In order for you to
break out another inmate?

183
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:52,201
- Yes.
- Who are these people?

184
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,960
I don't know,

185
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,870
but they have my brother's son.

186
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,462
They like to keep collateral.

187
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:05,193
I could be putting his life
in danger as we speak.

188
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:08,471
If what you told me is true...

189
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,170
...you would be saving him.

190
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,901
I would call my troops and order
a search for the boy immediately.

191
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,111
But this story...

192
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,212
it's fiction.

193
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:21,852
It's true.

194
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:25,613
It's what you wanted.
It's the only thing I have left to give.

195
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:29,611
Please.

196
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,070
His name is LJ.

197
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:36,823
He's only 16 years old.

198
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:47,271
- What's that smell?
- Armandos.

199
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,371
These things cost money.

200
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:51,783
Somebody gave them to me--
I don't even smoke those things.

201
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:52,460
Who?

202
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:55,051
This guy I ran some stuff
into the prison for, man.

203
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,353
You ran some stuff into the prison?
Like what? Drugs?

204
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:58,973
I don't know.
Who cares? He paid me.

205
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,303
- You should have quit that job, I...
- I know, okay?

206
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:04,362
I need some cash for my kid. Maricruz
doesn't have insurance, all right?

207
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,702
Listen. I... I just saw Michael.
He's in solitary confinement.

208
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:09,562
What?

209
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,033
They put him in a box out in the
middle of the yard, all by himself.

210
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:14,773
He can't do anything.

211
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,232
It's going to be okay.

212
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:19,872
It's not going to be okay.

213
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,511
I don't know what to do, man.

214
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:25,200
Everything's just fallen apart.

215
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:33,222
- What you lookin' at?
- The view.

216
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:36,610
I can't help but notice you
and Lechero made friends.

217
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,432
He's been hanging out with
a lot of white boys lately.

218
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,921
- Got a problem with that?
- No. But Sammy does.

219
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,360
See, I've been looking close,
like I always do.

220
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,812
And I know you all would
be a lot better off

221
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:48,740
if Sammy were no longer around.

222
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:53,113
Wouldn't have to worry about his
snout poking in your business.

223
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,301
- And you're suggesting...?
- We both know it needs to happen.

224
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:59,740
There aren't many men in Sona
who would take out Sammy.

225
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:03,042
I have one particular man in mind.
A man who owes me.

226
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:06,200
But if I pull through,
I'm in the club, guaranteed.

227
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,501
- You're gonna see to it.
- All right.

228
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:12,773
I assume you have the
power to make this deal.

229
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,930
I do. Agreed.

230
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:25,041
Right. Well. Thank you, sir.

231
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:53,073
Look, I've been thinking about
what you told me and, uh...

232
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:55,553
- but I can't quit my job.
- Do whatever you want to do.

233
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,862
Well, I would if you could
kick me a few bucks, you know.

234
00:17:57,935 --> 00:17:59,652
Are we gonna do this again?
I told you.

235
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,842
- I don't have any cash.
- What do you expect me to do?

236
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:04,102
- Do whatever you want.
- You could use my help, right?

237
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,412
You're gonna start charging
me now for your friendship?

238
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:07,460
I got a kid on the way!

239
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:09,531
And I got a kid I
may never see again.

240
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:19,501
Yeah, get me Gretchen.

241
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,963
Much to my surprise, there seems to
be some degree of truth to your tale.

242
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:33,633
- Everything I told you is true.
- That's for me to determine.

243
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:35,993
- What more can I say?
- This inmate.

244
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,391
The one who you've
been sent to free.

245
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:40,832
He should be able to verify
what you've told me.

246
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,070
He should but...
I don't know if he will.

247
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:45,712
Tell me his name.

248
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,730
These people won't hesitate
to kill my nephew.

249
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,323
I need to know you're gonna do
everything you can to find him.

250
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,231
- I will, but I need a name.
- I need your word.

251
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,392
You have it. I'll find the boy.
Now, the name.

252
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:03,422
Hi.

253
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:10,142
- What's wrong?
- Why don't you tell me?

254
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:12,912
I went to that apartment,
your apartment.

255
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:15,922
And this woman showed
up like she knew you.

256
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:18,483
And then I found a passport.

257
00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:21,412
Who's Gary Miller?

258
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:27,022
That apartment, that passport,

259
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:29,243
it's all for us.

260
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,692
It's how we're gonna get away.
When I get out of this place,

261
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,043
I'll be working on a way
for us to be together.

262
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,890
Remember how we always
talked about France?

263
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:41,390
Oh, James. Yeah.

264
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:44,662
Our plan to be together.

265
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:48,463
James, how...
how can I believe you?

266
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:51,050
How can I believe
anything anymore?

267
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,780
Whistler. Let's go.

268
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,803
Just know,
just know that I love you.

269
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:13,313
You're facing some
serious charges.

270
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:18,833
Michael Scofield told me there
are some people out there

271
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,703
who are very determined
to get you out of here.

272
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:26,670
- What's he talking about?
- You know nothing about this?

273
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:33,052
No. Scofield's a smart man but,
uh, he's got a rabid imagination.

274
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,241
So you're calling him a liar?

275
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,691
More or less.

276
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:42,992
I've been able to
verify the story.

277
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:48,493
I already know everything, Mr.
Whistler, in detail.

278
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:52,843
I just need a name.
Who's in charge on the outside?

279
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:56,603
We can end this right now
if you can provide it.

280
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:02,041
What are you talking about?

281
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:26,542
- What's going on here?
- Gracias.

282
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,072
Now, start over.

283
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,502
There you are.

284
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,923
And here I am,
without my bag of goodies.

285
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:48,963
I was afraid you
were gone for good.

286
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,212
Party would not be
the same without you.

287
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,660
I'm glad you're back,
cause I need a favor.

288
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,700
It involves you, a chicken foot
and a man who's got it comin'.

289
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,863
- What man?
- Sammy.

290
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:07,293
Now, you get well,
and you get him out there in that ring,

291
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,873
and you do that one, that...
neck thing.

292
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:13,640
In exchange, I'm gonna cover
all your medical expenses.

293
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,260
I'll tell you what.
You take your time.

294
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,080
I'm gonna go get my bag right now,
put you out of this misery.

295
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:23,802
You're the best cock
in the fight, Alex.

296
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:25,730
Please don't let me down.

297
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:33,160
Maybe now you'll feel more
comfortable telling me the truth.

298
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:37,501
Are you working with Scofield?

299
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:46,061
- Are you working with Scofield?!
- Yes! Yes, I'm working with Scofield.

300
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,640
But there's no
one else involved.

301
00:22:56,528 --> 00:23:00,913
As they say in America,
we're gonna get this story straight.

302
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:03,033
I told him the truth.

303
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:05,613
I suggest you do the same.

304
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,632
- I have.
- He's confirmed nothing!

305
00:23:07,865 --> 00:23:10,122
Ask him about that woman
he's been meeting with.

306
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:11,572
Huh?

307
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:15,010
That's not what you think.

308
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,280
Doesn't matter what I think;
it matters what you know,

309
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:19,643
and you know her name.
And the fact that he won't admit it

310
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:21,891
tells me that he's no
innocent bystander in this.

311
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,712
- You know I am.
- Prove it.

312
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:25,932
'Cause that's the only way
we're getting out of here.

313
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:28,160
Michael, this is suicide--
they'll kill Sofia.

314
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,202
- And they'll kill your brother's son.
- This is the man who can help us,

315
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:34,273
and he can't do anything without a name,
so tell him!

316
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:42,742
James... we don't have a choice.
It's over.

317
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:47,631
Gretchen Morgan.

318
00:23:57,327 --> 00:24:00,760
I don't know where she lives,
I don't know how you find her.

319
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,733
That's all I know, her name.

320
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:07,643
Gretchen Morgan.

321
00:24:18,677 --> 00:24:22,363
- Two more of those, please.
- Uh-uh. I'm gonna get going.

322
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:26,503
No, he'll stay. Relax...
Fernando, is it?

323
00:24:27,755 --> 00:24:30,823
I just want to talk
a minute. Alone.

324
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:34,900
This right here is as
alone as we're gonna get.

325
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:39,072
I heard about your
argument with Lincoln.

326
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,010
You people are everywhere, huh?

327
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,313
Now, you know him better than I do,
but from personal experience,

328
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:47,751
Burrows can be hard to handle.

329
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:50,391
That man does not like
to be told what to do.

330
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:53,343
He sure likes bossing
everyone else around.

331
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,123
You have to start looking
out for yourself, Fernando.

332
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:58,050
Level the playing field.

333
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:00,870
All you have to do is
go back, apologize,

334
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,412
tell him that you'll stay on
a few more days for free.

335
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:05,533
And tomorrow or the day after,
I'll call you,

336
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:08,630
and you'll meet me for a drink.
In exchange, I'll pay.

337
00:25:09,195 --> 00:25:12,921
50 grand. I know what you're thinking,
but I'm not asking you

338
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,521
to do anything that doesn't
help everyone in the long run.

339
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:17,240
I don't see how
this is helping.

340
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,833
Lincoln causes as many
problems as he solves.

341
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,692
He needs to get out of his own way,
and I think you can assist him.

342
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:25,810
I stay one step ahead,
and you get 50 grand.

343
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:32,143
I don't know.

344
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:36,020
I think you do.

345
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,902
Where do I find this
Gretchen Morgan?

346
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,872
She's somewhere here
in Panama City.

347
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:53,363
That's not much help in a
city of a million people.

348
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:56,561
- It could take days, weeks.
- I've told you. I only know her name.

349
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,380
- I have no idea.
- I do.

350
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:03,110
But I'll need to
use your phone.

351
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:12,651
- Linc.
- Michael! What phone are you on?

352
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:14,011
Just listen to me.

353
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:18,873
I need to know where and when your
next meeting with Susan B is.

354
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:22,121
Garfield-Price building
downtown in an hour. Why?

355
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:27,830
Garfield-Price, one hour.
Can you give her a message for me?

356
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:28,860
Yeah.

357
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:32,253
- Tell her everything is going as planned.
- What the hell's going on, Michael?

358
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:36,113
Just give her the message, Linc.
I'll see you soon.

359
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:17,683
You should have listened.

360
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:20,600
Are you going to throw down a
chicken foot over a puddle of puke?

361
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,782
You should have mopped.

362
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:33,390
Stumpy, wait your turn, man.

363
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:41,321
Excuse me.

364
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:43,911
I wanted to see Patrón Lechero,
por favor.

365
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,271
What you want to see him about?

366
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:49,842
I got one of these from him,
and I didn't do nothing.

367
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:51,482
He don't listen.

368
00:27:57,095 --> 00:28:00,963
The fight goes on as planned--
after we eat lunch.

369
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:15,761
Sammy.

370
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:18,372
You issue a fight?

371
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:22,653
- Yeah. What about it?
- It's not your right.

372
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:27,530
- It's not your place.
- Well, maybe it should be.

373
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,912
She's arrived? I'm on my way.

374
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:47,620
You'd better be right.

375
00:28:58,008 --> 00:28:59,372
What happened?

376
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,602
It worked.

377
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,471
- It did?
- Yeah.

378
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:08,490
She came up to me just like you
said and offered me a bunch of cash

379
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:11,250
- to talk behind your back.
- So we stick with the plan, right?

380
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:12,320
- Yeah.
- Cool.

381
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,512
I'm going to see her right now.

382
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:27,203
It's okay. I came back for you.

383
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:30,070
Come on, now,
everything's gonna be okay.

384
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,562
You can't deprive
yourself like this.

385
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:37,262
- Get out of here.
- You don't mean that.

386
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,230
Yeah... yeah, I do. I do.

387
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:41,821
Talk straight.
You're not talking straight.

388
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:43,982
Withdrawals are the
worst way to die.

389
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:45,770
You're going to shake,
and you'll sweat

390
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:48,791
until you evaporate into nothing.
It's a long bumpy road to hell.

391
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:50,972
Is that what you want, Alex?
Or do you wanna live?

392
00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:57,140
See you on the other side.

393
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:08,433
When you're up all night...

394
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:12,480
with diarrhea running down both your
legs and vomit is in your hair...

395
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:15,940
...don't come crawling back.

396
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:41,992
It's been a long day.
Let's just get this over with.

397
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:45,010
I got a message from my brother.
Everything is going ahead as planned.

398
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:48,822
Really? I would think you'd
be facing a major setback.

399
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,652
You know Michael.
Always has things worked out.

400
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:54,142
No, I don't.
Seems to me he keeps screwing things up.

401
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:56,400
He's getting things done a
whole lot faster than you.

402
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,470
Whistler's out by tomorrow,
all right?

403
00:30:58,848 --> 00:31:02,142
- Gretchen Morgan?
- Yes.

404
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:04,873
General Zavala,
Panamanian National Police.

405
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:07,141
- Come with us, please.
- Why? What's this all about?

406
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:08,643
- Llevenla.
- No, I don't understand.

407
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:11,100
- I don't understand. Wait!
- I had nothing to do with this.

408
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:13,770
I had nothing to do
with this! Nothing!

409
00:31:22,795 --> 00:31:26,563
You're denying that you are involved
with escape attempts at Sona prison.

410
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:29,423
I have never been here
before in my life.

411
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,961
And you've never met any of
the men incarcerated here?

412
00:31:32,196 --> 00:31:33,793
- No!
- James Whistler?

413
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,032
- No.
- You know what I've been told?

414
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:38,142
From prisoners?
I can only imagine.

415
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:41,200
I've been told that you are the
mastermind behind a prison escape

416
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:44,222
and that you've kidnapped
a boy as collateral.

417
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:45,530
Really?

418
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:49,091
Am I an alien? Did I shoot JFK?

419
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:53,483
Sir, I have no idea who
this James Wilson...

420
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:55,213
- Whistler.
- ...is!

421
00:31:56,518 --> 00:32:00,103
I'm just here to relax before I
have to go back to another year

422
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:03,443
of teaching social studies
to freshman idiots.

423
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:05,081
You're a tourist here?

424
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:08,860
No, not a tourist, sir.

425
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,991
I like to think of myself
as a "student of life."

426
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,620
"A student of life"?

427
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:19,651
Abre la manguera!

428
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:24,311
What did he say?

429
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:26,330
"Turn on the hose."

430
00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:17,143
Fight! Fight! Fight!

431
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:24,631
I'm going to give
you one chance.

432
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:30,271
Did you order the escape from
Sona penitentiary? Yes or no?

433
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:54,160
Yes or no?

434
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,492
You seem concerned for her.

435
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:05,461
She holds our entire future in
her hands. Yeah, I'm concerned.

436
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:15,263
Yes or no?!

437
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,611
No!

438
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:29,813
You've proven one thing.
This is not your first time.

439
00:34:40,886 --> 00:34:42,100
Come with me.

440
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:58,403
Do you know either
of these men?

441
00:34:59,288 --> 00:35:01,542
- I've never seen them before.
- That's a lie.

442
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:03,782
I've never seen them
before in my life.

443
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:05,651
Where and when
have you seen her?

444
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:08,431
She came to see him in visitation,
isn't that right?

445
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:11,850
Is this the woman you work for?

446
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:15,862
Did she order the
prison escape?

447
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,692
Yes or no?

448
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,151
Yes.

449
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:28,663
All right, all right.

450
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,320
- You're the one in charge?
- No.

451
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:34,230
I don't know anything
about a prison escape.

452
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:38,260
I'm just the baby-sitter.
I watch the kid.

453
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:43,173
- Where is he?
- Near Paloma. Highway 2.

454
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:47,210
- I can take you.
- Take them back to my office.

455
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,552
Put the girl back in the car.
We're going on a drive.

456
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:55,531
Was it you?

457
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:58,240
Did you kill Sara?

458
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:02,213
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

459
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:07,430
I'm coming for you.

460
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:58,590
Yeah!

461
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:11,313
Congratulations.

462
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:14,131
You're a regular Buster Douglas,
aren't you?

463
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:18,372
Hey, what is this?
How'd you get that up there, huh?

464
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:27,521
Mm-hmm.

465
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:36,440
Right there.
The boy is in there.

466
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:42,450
- In here?
- I'm so sorry.

467
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:51,671
I am so sorry.
I hope he's all right.

468
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,003
Pick me up.

469
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,742
I'm at the shack.

470
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:23,700
Bring towels.

471
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,412
Hi, Lincoln.

472
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:41,041
- Augusto.
- Good to see you.

473
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:45,891
- Yeah, thanks for the cigars.
- You didn't open the package?

474
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:47,913
I didn't get around
to it today.

475
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:53,180
You need to make a choice.

476
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:56,331
Lechero's days are numbered.
You agree?

477
00:38:58,695 --> 00:39:00,531
Then you know what
you need to do.

478
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:06,171
You've done a good job so far.
Now is the time to make a move.

479
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:12,281
Prove yourself.
Go back in and open the package.

480
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:40,431
What are they doing in here?

481
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:43,083
They were here for questioning.

482
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:48,470
- Come on. Let's go.
- What happened to the General?

483
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:51,810
The General was found dead
this morning off Highway 2.

484
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:54,950
You're going back inside.

485
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,092
I'm sorry to hear that.

486
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,952
He seemed like a nice man.

487
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,880
What you doing back here?

488
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,402
If you still want to get out of here,
I need your phone.

489
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:40,662
Go inside.

490
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:52,412
- What?
- How's LJ?

491
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:55,002
He's fine. But you know what?
Susan's not.

492
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,921
He's fine? Are you sure?

493
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,132
Yeah. I just got off
the phone with him.

494
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:01,343
Why didn't you tell
me what was going on?

495
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:03,572
He could have died
because of what you did.

496
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:07,113
We've still got Whistler.
As long as we do, we're okay.

497
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:10,833
I got to go.

498
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:16,273
Hey, did you see blanco?
He's walking around like the landlord.

499
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:18,831
I thought you said Lechero
was going to take care of it?

500
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:21,061
- He will.
- How long has he been saying that?

501
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,842
If you and Lechero want to go
around like an old married couple,

502
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,680
fighting this way or that...
Maybe you like it in the kitchen.

503
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:29,222
- Hey, you be careful.
- Then do something!

504
00:41:29,648 --> 00:41:33,371
Or the next thing you know, you're
gonna be taking orders from Scofield.

505
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:39,521
Some people stop
at nothing, huh?

506
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:41,340
Uh...

507
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:44,891
Yeah. I know.

508
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,002
At least we're back inside.

509
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:52,521
Which of course is exactly
what you wanted. Isn't it?

510
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:55,672
- What are you talking about?
- You let the fox into the henhouse.

511
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:57,932
The only reason you
gave up Gretchen's name

512
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:00,702
was so she could come in and
pull you out of the fire.

513
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:02,702
You wanted me to
give up her name.

514
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:06,802
You know it doesn't
end with her.

515
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:08,683
Yeah, I do.

516
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:10,652
The question is how do you?

517
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:15,071
How does a simple fisherman seem
to know so much about the Company?

518
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:16,763
When she comes back,

519
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:18,441
and she will...

520
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:23,200
...what am I gonna say?

521
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:26,392
You gonna do this or not?

522
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:31,392
You can tell her
the answer is yes.

523
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:34,641
But once we're out,
I consider you collateral...

524
00:42:35,477 --> 00:42:36,743
nothing more.

525
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:06,793
