00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:01,902
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:03,053
It will work out.

3
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:04,838
You have my word. Be careful.

4
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:06,737
Jane's gonna look after you.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,400
I have a sister,
I haven't talked to in 15 years.

6
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,298
You think she's better off for it?

7
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:15,374
- Bruce?
- I know we said not to use this number,

8
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,156
but I just needed to know you were okay.

9
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:18,157
It was you.

10
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:20,256
<i>What are you talking about, Sara?</i>

11
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:26,097
- I got three words for you.
- Yeah?

12
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:27,217
We gotta run.

13
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,541
I want to turn myself in.

14
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:31,544
<i>But I got one condition.</i>

15
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,481
Your wife was released an hour ago.

16
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:34,658
She'll be here soon.

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,780
Just hold up your end of the deal.

18
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,125
I'll get you Scofield.

19
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,109
An NSA analyst sympathetic to our cause

20
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:43,754
got his hands on a phone
conversation the president had

21
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,822
with Terrence Steadman two weeks after
after you supposedly killed him.

22
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,861
24 hours later, Tancredi is dead,

23
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:51,730
the analyst is missing,

24
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:53,979
and the White House
Echelon tapes have been deleted

25
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,097
from the mainframe.

26
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,836
There's a tape,
gives us everything we need.

27
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,954
Linc will be set free if we find it.

28
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,602
You have something here.

29
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,379
There are gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

30
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,155
You think it's a conversation?

31
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,119
One they don't want us to hear.

32
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,403
You ready?

33
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,779
Let's do it.

34
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:44,298
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,206
Patoshik...

36
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:54,105
dead.

37
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:57,594
Franklin, incarcerated
and assisting with the capture

38
00:01:57,613 --> 00:01:58,980
of Scofield and Burrows.

39
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:00,766
What exactly is the protocol with that?

40
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:01,767
I'll handle that.

41
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:04,269
We're at the halfway mark, people.

42
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,216
Burrows, Scofield...

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,094
Bagwell, Sucre...
they're still out there.

44
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,372
- Now, I heard a report came in from...
- Mexico.

45
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:16,091
Fernando Sucre was almost apprehended
at the airport in Ixtapa.

46
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:25,885
Excuse me.

47
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:29,690
My office, please.

48
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:34,590
What the hell are you doing here?

49
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:36,061
I came for my damn money.

50
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:39,371
- Your what?
- The Patoshik reward money.

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,911
See, how a reward works is, someone gets

52
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,523
rewarded the money,
and since I'm the one

53
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,587
who bloodhounded Haywire,
the money gets rewarded to me.

54
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,090
You come to my office...

55
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,029
If you'd returned any of my calls,
I wouldn't have had to.

56
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:53,328
We had a deal.

57
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,085
The deal was
that you stay under the radar.

58
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:56,850
Is this under the radar, Brad?

59
00:02:56,862 --> 00:02:58,683
No, this is an office
full of federal agents,

60
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,558
who now have all seen your face.

61
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:02,532
Yeah, I don't care what they see.

62
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,839
Hell, if you don't pay up,

63
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,551
I'll go out there and drop trou.

64
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,845
Patoshik died,
you stupid son of a bitch.

65
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:27,035
There's paperwork involved.

66
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,885
Of course you're going to get the money.

67
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,889
But you're gonna have to be patient.

68
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,658
And if you ever...

69
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:35,706
come in my office again,

70
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:39,310
you'll not only never see the cash,

71
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,387
you'll never see another sunrise.

72
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,071
Now, are we gonna keep
crying about money

73
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,880
you've already got coming to you?

74
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,561
Or do you want to make some more?

75
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,497
I'm listening.

76
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:02,781
Ever been to Mexico?

77
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,764
We give this thing to the press,
the government's gonna discredit it,

78
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:11,822
just like they did
with the tape we made.

79
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,376
So what do we do with it?

80
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:18,926
Dad said there're still people
in the administration

81
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,006
that he was working with.

82
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:21,526
If we give the tape to them,

83
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:25,032
they'll finally have the smoking gun
they need to bring Mrs. Reynolds down.

84
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,292
But they'll release the tape... not us.

85
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,017
And how can she discredit
her own appointees? Sure.

86
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,899
We're gonna give the only thing that can

87
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,689
exonerate me to someone
who works for the government?

88
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,122
The same government that set me up?!

89
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,436
We'll have to find someone we can trust,

90
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,514
someone honest.

91
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:44,415
Jane Phillips.

92
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,719
She'll know someone that can help us.

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,014
She worked with Dad; she's watching LJ.

94
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,414
I trust her, Michael.

95
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,254
She'll do it; she'll find someone.

96
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,815
Well, I hope you're right.

97
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,993
Because this is our last shot.

98
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:04,820
This'll do you right.

99
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:06,625
She's a Remington 700.

100
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:08,869
She a clean shot?

101
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,659
Like a good woman, she does not stray.

102
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:14,336
Varmint, stainless steel fluted barrel,

103
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:16,925
heavyweight caliber,
175-grain hollow point.

104
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,643
I'll take the case, too.

105
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:23,644
She's a throw-in.

106
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,358
Serial numbers have been cleaned.

107
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,712
Chamber's been scraped
to throw off ballistics,

108
00:05:32,713 --> 00:05:35,745
just in case you're not, you know,
shooting at tin cans.

109
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:40,650
No, I'm hunting bigger game than that.

Transcript : swsub.com

111
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:20,529
Radio silence.

112
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,697
Look, I just don't know how often
he checks this thing, all right?

113
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,949
Well, it seems not that often,

114
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,347
considering you've posted
three messages.

115
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,848
I'm starting to wonder
why I need you at all.

116
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,849
To get Scofield.

117
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:34,661
What? What are we doing here?

118
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,306
Well, I can type, and Scofield can't see

119
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:38,655
who's sending him the messages.

120
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:41,812
Well, you know what, he's gonna see
whatever little rent-a-Fed cops

121
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:43,491
that you guys have set up,
whatever place

122
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:44,624
you'll set up to meet him.

123
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,879
Now, you and I both know
how smart this kid is, right?

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,695
Smarter than you,
considering you're the one

125
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,766
- who's wearing bright orange.
- Oh, yeah?

126
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,126
Yeah.

127
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:54,494
Fish is not gonna peek
his little white ass

128
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:57,698
out from any rock that he's hiding
unless he sees a familiar face.

129
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,640
A famili... And that's your face, right?

130
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,741
Yeah! Don't pretend

131
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,141
- You said Sucre...
- like you don't need me!

132
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,996
You heard him telling Sucre
about a Web site!

133
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,326
Don't act like you don't need me!

134
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:07,367
You overheard something?

135
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,624
- Look, he's a Boy Scout, he...
- I don't see...

136
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,706
He helps, okay?!

137
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:13,262
If you have a little bit of patience,
he will hit me back!

138
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,296
I'm the only one helping
your family right now.

139
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,817
- I help my family, okay?
- So do I.

140
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:18,418
I'm the one who released Kacee,

141
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,606
who got Dede medical care,

142
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,971
who allows you to visit them,

143
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:23,207
and I'm the one that can take it away.

144
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,732
Well, you know what, it looks like
we both need each other, doesn't it?

145
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,078
- Do we?
- So I am gonna hold up

146
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,314
my end of the bargain, and guess what?

147
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:32,096
You hold up yours.

148
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,124
Now, get off my back.

149
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,094
You can get what you want.

150
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,565
Just give me what I want.

151
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:42,807
Give me Scofield.

152
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,013
Hey, buddy.

153
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:52,164
Dad?

154
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:53,964
Yeah, it's me.

155
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,286
How you holding up?

156
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:56,895
Okay. How about you?

157
00:07:57,672 --> 00:07:58,682
<i>Good.</i>

158
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,153
I...

159
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:02,578
I miss you.

160
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,166
Yeah, me, too.

161
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,034
I didn't know you had Jane's number.

162
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:10,675
Yeah, well, uh, we exchanged numbers
when you guys split.

163
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:12,435
You never called.

164
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:13,982
No. Yeah...

165
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,138
I'm sorry, it's been...
It's been dangerous.

166
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:18,889
You know? A little dangerous.

167
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,890
It's okay.

168
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,291
<i>LJ...</i>

169
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,476
Listen, I know I've said this before,

170
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:25,869
but I think we've found something

171
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,807
that's finally gonna put this stuff
behind us.

172
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,541
When it's good, when it's safe,

173
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,140
I'm going to come and get you.

174
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:32,501
You, me, your uncle...

175
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:33,608
Dad.

176
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:34,911
Yeah?

177
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,486
I want you to end this
more than anything,

178
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:40,561
but... I'm in school again.

179
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:44,964
Under a fake name,
but it's still school, you know?

180
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,826
I mean, it's not the same,
but it's the closest thing

181
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,827
to a home I've had in a long time.

182
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:51,928
<i>I... I guess...</i>

183
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,213
<i>I guess I'm just saying that...</i>

184
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:56,408
For now,

185
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,045
for... For a while...

186
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:01,582
I just want to stay in one place,

187
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:03,838
<i>have something normal.</i>

188
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:08,415
I get it.

189
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:09,655
I...

190
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:11,890
I need to speak with Jane.

191
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,013
I love you, Dad.

192
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:19,808
I love you, too, son.

193
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,239
Mr. Webster.

194
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,869
Sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,358
Ah, it's no problem, Doc.

196
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,899
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate

197
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,958
you seeing me on such short notice.

198
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,017
That's what I'm here for.

199
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:42,603
Good.

200
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:46,402
'Cause I got a few things
I need to get off my chest.

201
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
See you, Jane.

202
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:00,258
Cooper Green?

203
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:03,912
Former deputy attorney general.

204
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:06,672
Splits his time between DC,
Chicago and New York.

205
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,169
Jane says he's been an ally of Dad's
forever.

206
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,758
We find him, we got a shot.

207
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,138
How is LJ?

208
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,818
He's doing all right.

209
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:27,640
Cooper Green's office.

210
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:30,499
I'm sorry, Mr. Green isn't available
at this time.

211
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,755
<i>Please, this is very important.</i>

212
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,563
Just tell him I have some information

213
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,815
regarding the sons of Aldo Burrows.

214
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:37,309
Aldo Burrows?

215
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,664
He and Mr. Green used to work together.

216
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,265
Please hold. I'll try to reach him.

217
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,195
She's tracking him down.

218
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,505
<i>this is Michael Scofield.</i>

219
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,907
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

220
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:56,599
Of course. I knew your father.

221
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,978
And I know what happened to him.

222
00:10:58,006 --> 00:11:00,867
I'm sorry. He was a good man
trying to do good things.

223
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,868
Well, so are we.

224
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:03,826
We have something.

225
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
The tape.

226
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:06,602
<i>You've heard of it.</i>

227
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:08,850
Well, I know a lot of people
have been looking for it.

228
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,244
What's on the tape?

229
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,627
<i>If you want to find out,</i>

230
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,531
there's a bronze statue of a mammoth

231
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,987
at the southwest corner of Ebert Park.
I need you there in an hour.

232
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,094
Do you have a blue suit?

233
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,082
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Wear it, and a red tie.

234
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:22,782
That way, we'll know who you are.

235
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:26,065
Ready?

236
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,169
Yeah.

237
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,479
Good luck.

238
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:47,250
This will work.

239
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,607
You think?

240
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,328
Hello, Sara.

241
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,589
I figured you'd show up eventually.

242
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:36,569
You look good, Bruce.

243
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:41,355
You've done well for yourself
at my father's expense.

244
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:43,407
I had nothing to do with your father.

245
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,937
- Your father was murdered.
- By you.

246
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:46,819
And then you tried to have me killed.
Don't...

247
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:48,426
How can you say that?

248
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:52,143
My line was tapped, and they heard you
tell me that you were at that pay phone.

249
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,465
Sara, I've known your family
my entire life.

250
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,232
Which makes your betrayal disgusting.

251
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:01,832
FYI, I've been tortured already.
It didn't work.

252
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:03,924
I shouldn't have to defend myself
to you, Sara.

253
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,109
If you can't trust me,

254
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,164
then all I can do is just wish you luck.

255
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:09,713
Go.

256
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:30,722
Look,

257
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:32,144
before you get started,

258
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,718
I'm gonna save you some time
here, <i>jefe.</i>

259
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,242
I played rat for you once,
and that was it.

260
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:38,478
I got protection now.

261
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,895
I let the top bangers in here
cherry pick the laundry,

262
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:44,575
clean sheets, new shorts...
and for that,

263
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:46,606
I'm untouchable.

264
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,344
So threaten all you want, <i>homes.</i>

265
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,043
Yo, man, what are you going to do?

266
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:01,849
You don't look like
you play too much tennis, Manche.

267
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:04,817
This is probably more your speed.

268
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:06,555
Entertainment center.

269
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,479
Wide-screen plasma.

270
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:11,470
Pinball.

271
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,906
Pool table.

272
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:14,816
Yo, man, what the hell is this?

273
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:15,821
Your future.

274
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,839
At Kankakee Minimum Security
Correctional Center,

275
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,868
where the only thing
softer that the pillows are the guards.

276
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,245
I didn't come here to threaten.

277
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:28,328
I mean, why whip the mule
when he'll work

278
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:30,034
even harder for a sugar cube?

279
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:35,541
The same connections that got this fox
out of the river so quick.

280
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,494
Well, I can use them for you, too.

281
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:39,149
All I need to know

282
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:42,656
is where down in Mexico
your cousin Sucre is headed.

283
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,153
Look, <i>mami</i>, look!

284
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,622
I told you. Llamas!

285
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,471
I think those are alpacas.

286
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:13,588
That's what I said, a pack-a llamas.

287
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:55,361
What I'm trying to tell you, Doc,

288
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,043
is I just feel like I've been

289
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,133
a penny on the train tracks
my entire life.

290
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:05,317
And that 'ole Union Pacific
just keeps on coming, every day,

291
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,677
back and forth, just running me down,
running me over,

292
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,140
but I will not...

293
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,266
flatten... I will not flatten.

294
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,185
You know the nice thing
about pennies, Mr. Webster?

295
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:16,597
They have dates on them.

296
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,516
And you can pick the date.

297
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,690
Your own date.

298
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,245
Today's date.

299
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,323
You can get a fresh start.

300
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,208
You can be a brand-new shiny penny.

301
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:31,373
You know, I got to be
honest with you, Doc; I had no...

302
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:33,939
intention of whatsoever

303
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:36,651
talking to you once
I got inside your office today.

304
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,896
But I have to admit, I find therapy...

305
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,848
Well, it's therapeutic.

306
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:47,386
I don't follow.

307
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:50,581
If you didn't plan on talking today,
why did you come in?

308
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:01,880
Well, I saw the ad on the back
of the bus stop today.

309
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:06,005
And...

310
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:09,398
though it wasn't exactly
like looking in the mirror,

311
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:12,703
you can't deny
that there's a certain...

312
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,263
...commonality

313
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,084
in our visages.

314
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:22,450
I guess we do look a little bit alike...

315
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:26,832
But I don't understand.

316
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:36,571
What the hell you think you're doing?

317
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,207
Hello.

318
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,814
- <i>Mr. Green?</i>
- Yes.

319
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,256
This is Lincoln Burrows.

320
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,193
Do exactly what I say.

321
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,003
<i>Your suit jacket.</i>

322
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,086
Toss it in the trash behind you.

323
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,369
Excuse me?

324
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Do it.

325
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:35,577
All right. I just threw
my $2,000 Zegna suit jacket

326
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:36,639
in the garbage.

327
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,796
<i>Good.</i>

328
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,658
There's a phone
on the other side of the park.

329
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,129
Be there in four minutes.

330
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:43,152
Four...

331
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:06,671
Make it quick.
This cell is running out of juice.

332
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,120
You were right.

333
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,240
He's been tailed.

334
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:11,241
Yeah.

335
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:13,191
<i>On it.</i>

336
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:22,837
- Yeah?
<i>- I'm looking for</i>

337
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:24,494
<i>a guy in a suit.</i>

338
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:26,022
Lots of guys with suits.

339
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:27,615
It's me.

340
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,163
See the fountain?

341
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:33,729
How could I not?

342
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:35,181
Get in.

343
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,027
They want to drown the mics in case

344
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:08,028
we bugged him.

345
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,039
Hey, mister.

346
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:17,637
This is for you.

347
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:19,104
I'm not interested.

348
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:21,326
I'm not selling it.
Some dude gave me

349
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,259
20 bucks to give it
to the first wet guy I see.

350
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Here.

351
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:30,604
<i>See the building across from you?</i>

352
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Yeah.

353
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:32,918
<i>Go inside.</i>

354
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,214
Look, this is getting ridiculous.

355
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:36,656
I've done everything you've asked.
If you want to meet me...

356
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:39,022
We've been burned way too many times,
Mr. Green.

357
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:41,527
We need to make sure
that this thing goes down right.

358
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,998
Go inside,
and keep the phone to your ear.

359
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,762
- Where are we?
<i>- He's gone inside<i/>

360
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:00,551
<i>the Beck Museum
but we've got men out back.<i>

361
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:01,963
He's not going anywhere.

362
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:08,365
Yeah?

363
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,409
<i>Get to Ebert Park.</i>

364
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,275
<i>I have men on Scofield and Burrows.</i>

365
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,020
Ebert Park?

366
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:16,280
Scofield set a meet with
a target we're surveilling.

367
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:18,432
What the hell is Scofield doing
in Chicago?

368
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:21,668
You're asking why the deer
walked into your crosshairs?

369
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,772
Just take the shot, Mahone.

370
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:25,671
I'm on it. I'm on it.

371
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:27,043
And Alex.

372
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,247
Using Franklin to help me find Scofield.

373
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,362
Yeah.

374
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,668
We don't need him for that anymore.

375
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:37,545
What I do need
is a death with no questions.

376
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,440
Hey, look, it's nothing yet,
man,

377
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,355
but I'm sure
he'll hit me real soon, okay?

378
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,546
You know,
if I were in your situation...

379
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:08,389
...everything you've done,
every decision you've made...

380
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,306
I'd have done the same thing.

381
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:16,486
You're a good man, good father.

382
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:19,599
There's, uh...been a change of plans.

383
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:25,195
It looks like I'm not gonna need
your help after all.

384
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:29,523
So you found Scofield.

385
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,680
My colleagues are getting pretty close,
yeah.

386
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,369
- So...
-So I guess you can set me free, then.

387
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,459
Of course not.

388
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:54,074
You and me, we had a deal, right?

389
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,075
Right.

390
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,303
I get your wife released,

391
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,203
take care of your daughter's health,

392
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:03,162
you get me Scofield.

393
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:07,897
But you, you're getting him yourself.
You just said that.

394
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,256
I know, I know.
I just want you to know...

395
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:16,565
...that, uh, I'm going to keep
my promise to you and ...

396
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:19,045
and I'm going to help your family.

397
00:23:20,124 --> 00:23:21,926
But I'm gonna need your help, too

398
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:25,456
and this is something that you're not
gonna want to do and I don't want

399
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:27,824
you to do this, but I need you
to do this and if you don't,

400
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:29,187
I will have Kacee arrested again,

401
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:31,240
and I will have
Dede's medical care stopped,

402
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:33,791
and I will hate myself,
and it will make me sick,

403
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,027
but I swear to God...

404
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,857
I will ruin their lives. Don't make me.

405
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,768
What the hell are you saying to me?

406
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:47,228
Today,
you'll get a package in your cell.

407
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,667
Its gonna be from me.
I need you to use it. Okay?

408
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:50,785
Okay. What's in it?

409
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,575
Yo. What the hell is in it, man?

410
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:58,693
Just use it, or you'll wish you had.

411
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:01,075
What's in the package?

412
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:03,812
What the hell is in the package, man?

413
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:15,953
Okay. I'm in the lobby.

414
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:18,719
Take the stairs to your left.

415
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:23,854
When you get to the top,
cross the catwalk.

416
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:32,445
Okay, I'm across.

417
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:35,888
Go down the hall,
down the stairs to the basement.

418
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:50,772
Go through the white door.

419
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:52,722
The one on the left.

420
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:58,502
Sara, I wish you had come to me first.

421
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:00,326
Cooper Green and I go way back.

422
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:03,210
If anyone can help Michael
and Lincoln, it's him.

423
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,275
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:05,280
Is Mr. Green in?

425
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:06,590
Is he expecting you?

426
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,123
Bruce.

427
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,464
Oh, good, you're back.

428
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:11,925
I'm here to help you.

429
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,043
Help me? With what?

430
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,103
Scofield and Burrows.
Where are they now?

431
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:16,128
This is absurd.

432
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:17,834
This tunnel goes underground.

433
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,717
You're already under another building.

434
00:25:20,985 --> 00:25:22,985
See the second door on your right?

435
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:24,794
Yeah.

436
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:25,801
Congratulations.

437
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,836
You made it.

438
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,804
I'm sorry. Sara Tancredi.
I trust you've met

439
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:37,112
with Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows today?

440
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:39,289
Well, I'm sure I'd remember if I did.

441
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:44,584
If you're Cooper Green,
who's with Michael right now?

442
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:49,461
I'm Michael Scofield.

443
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,459
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.

444
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:56,606
Do you... uh,
do you have the tape?

445
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:58,798
It's right here.

446
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:08,617
<i>Lincoln, it's Sara.
Listen to me.</i>

447
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:11,570
The man that Michael's with right now
is not Cooper Green, do you hear me?

448
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,688
The man that Michael's with
right now is not Cooper Green.

449
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,349
We should hurry.

450
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,784
You're in Chicago... it won't be long

451
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:32,059
before the Company knows you're in town.

452
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:34,280
Where are we going?

453
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:36,569
Well, we're going
to make sure that that tape

454
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,981
goes in the right hands.

455
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:39,468
Whose?

456
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:41,876
A friend.

457
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:44,705
What kind of friend?

458
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:47,220
He's a federal judge.

459
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:49,830
Is that good enough for you?

460
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:53,460
This tape is my brother's life.

461
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:54,889
And mine.

462
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,211
And consequently...

463
00:26:58,504 --> 00:26:59,504
I need a name.

464
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,118
Judge Scott Warren,

465
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:06,659
a lifetime appointee
who was put on the bench

466
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:07,780
by President Mills.

467
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:11,567
He has no job to lose,
no loyalty to Reynolds.

468
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,269
He wants to see her gone, just like us.

469
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:17,071
Well, let's go.

470
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:18,674
I left my car
over by the statue.

471
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:20,263
You were tailed, Mr. Green.

472
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:23,030
The judge comes to us.

473
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,597
I'll set up the meeting.

474
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:27,783
Do you see my clothes?

475
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:29,902
Your brother made certain

476
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:32,453
that anybody who was tailing me
is long gone,

477
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:34,630
and on top of that, I'm an asthmatic.

478
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,859
My inhaler is in my jacket pocket,

479
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:39,012
which Lincoln made me throw away.

480
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,327
I'm okay now,
but in about ten minutes,

481
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,706
I'm gonna have a hard time breathing.

482
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:46,986
I've got a spare in my glove box,

483
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,045
so could we please

484
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:50,506
just get back to my car?

485
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:01,309
My car is just a few blocks away.

486
00:28:02,368 --> 00:28:04,426
Albuterol, Cortizaid or Prednizone?

487
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:05,530
What?

488
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:06,966
My mother was an asthmatic.

489
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,132
What do you use in your inhaler?

490
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,884
What the hell difference does it make?

491
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:13,826
Just answer the question, please.

492
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

493
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,395
How many times
I got to prove myself to you?

494
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:20,396
Just one.

495
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:26,500
Fine. Uh... Cortizaid.

496
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,266
I'm sorry.

497
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,267
It's just, uh...

498
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:37,197
if you knew what, uh,
if you knew what we've been through

499
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:38,873
I understand.

500
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:40,730
Can we now just, please

501
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,148
- go to my car?
- Yeah.

502
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:00,608
One-way ticket to Bangkok,
s'il vous plait.

503
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:02,822
Oh, I'm sorry.

504
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:04,969
We don't have anything until tomorrow.

505
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,675
Unless you don't mind
taking a few connections

506
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:11,177
through Chicago,
and there's one more international stop.

507
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,977
Whatever leaves first.

508
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:15,095
I. D, please.

509
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:20,806
Okay, Mister... Stammel?

510
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,023
Oh, it's, uh, it's Doctor Stammel,

511
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:25,171
- and thank you.
- All right,

512
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:26,580
it'll be just a few minutes.

513
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,406
I'll check this bag for you, sir.

514
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:31,103
Oh, no, that's coming with me.
Give it back.

515
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:34,711
Sir, I know that bag is way over
the weight limit for carry-on.

516
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,264
What difference does a few extra pounds

517
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:38,633
make on a three-ton aircraft,

518
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:40,163
whether that's up above or underneath?

519
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:41,578
It's an FAA violation.

520
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:44,729
Sir, your bag will be safe.

521
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:01,802
<i>Today will be a tough day for travelers
in the Windy City as all streets</i>

522
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,370
<i>in a six-block radius

00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,803
<i>This'll be one

526
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:16,815
<i>for the president

527
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:18,444
Theo, I know you're new,

528
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:21,408
but we use both sides of legal pads
in this office, okay?

529
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:23,115
Before we recycle, we reduce.

530
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:25,191
The Comanche used the entire buffalo.

531
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:26,808
So can we.

532
00:30:27,463 --> 00:30:29,717
Actually, a majority of tribes
would farm land

533
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:31,218
till it was stripped of its utility,

534
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,111
then they'd just... move on.

535
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:34,459
The Indian as conservationist

536
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:37,415
is a myth created
by white liberal guilt.

537
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
Paul.

538
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:41,719
Hi, Kristine.

539
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,673
I'd hoped maybe I'd see you
at Dad's funeral.

540
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:46,785
That man died
long before his heart stopped.

541
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:48,491
That funeral was a formality.

542
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:50,740
- That's really not fair.
- It's true.

543
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,454
So... you want to know how Mom is?

544
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:55,881
Just 'cause someone spits you
out of their crotch

545
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:57,448
doesn't make them your mother.

546
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:58,848
That woman is insane.

547
00:30:59,673 --> 00:31:01,596
Do you remember?
Have you suppressed it all?

548
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:03,681
I know, Paul. I was there every day...

549
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,803
- unlike you.
- I was there for 18 years.

550
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:06,986
Then you just left.

551
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,952
I was ten, Paul.

552
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:11,634
You were all I had in the world, and...

553
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:14,074
you just left me there.

554
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:17,129
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,435
If I could have taken you with me,
I would have,

556
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:24,612
and I've thought about you every day.

557
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,598
I'm not the brother you remember.

558
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:38,614
I've changed...

559
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:40,468
in a...

560
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,529
really bad way.

561
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:49,556
To the point where I don't know
what good or bad is anymore

562
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:52,293
and I am going to do something...

563
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,097
I have to do something...

564
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,919
that a lot of people are going to think
is horrible.

565
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:01,635
And you just remember...

566
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:04,612
the brother you grew up with.

567
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:06,085
You just remember him.

568
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:13,921
You're my sister, Kristine,
and I love you.

569
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,619
I was out cold.
I don't know where they went.

570
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,048
And it was their idea for you

571
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,478
to meet them here
in the middle of Chicago?

572
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,569
Oh, man.

573
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:46,462
You brought me in too late.
They're gone.

574
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:49,443
Then find them.

575
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:52,146
Let me get this straight.
The brothers come back to a city

576
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:54,308
that's 15 miles from the prison
they escaped from.

577
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:55,661
Why would they do that?

578
00:32:55,662 --> 00:32:57,510
Maybe it's because the president
is in Chicago

579
00:32:57,548 --> 00:32:59,436
to make a speech,
and they're up to something,

580
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,308
which is why we need to find them.

581
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:04,014
And of all people,
they want to meet with somebody

582
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,939
from the attorney general's office?

583
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:07,324
Your point?

584
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:09,208
Burrows is innocent.

585
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,609
You're good, Alex.

586
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:13,948
As advertised.

587
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,024
No one's truly innocent.

588
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:19,308
<i>You of all people should know that.</i>

589
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:26,569
It must have been the receptionist.

590
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,097
She's the only one I spoke to.

591
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:44,069
Michael Scofield. Cooper Green.

592
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,263
We got to get as much of that in
as possible before the baby gets here.

593
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,304
Why?

594
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:48,163
Because,
once the baby's growing in there,

595
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
doesn't it just get kind of wrong?

596
00:34:58,117 --> 00:34:59,693
- What?
- I just felt the baby move.

597
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,640
That's impossible.
It's a little too early...

598
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,052
I know what I just felt.

599
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:07,297
Well, the doctor did say
that he can become active

600
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:08,768
after certain activities.

601
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:16,344
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah, like a flutter.

602
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,187
Flutter my ass! He's strong!

603
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,773
He's going to be the captain
of the National Soccer Team.

604
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,441
You hear that, Junior?

605
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:26,368
As soon as you're born,
I'm putting a soccer ball in your hands.

606
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:28,025
No, he's going to have books.

607
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:32,188
Fine. Books about soccer.

608
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:37,650
See, baby.

609
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:40,616
I told you everything was going
to work out.

610
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,336
We're out in the middle of nowhere,

611
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,074
baby's doing great.

612
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:48,186
Everything's going to be perfect.

613
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:53,578
<i>Well, it looks like we've got
nothing but smooth skies ahead,</i>

614
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,773
<i>so we should be arriving</i>

615
00:35:54,774 --> 00:35:56,719
- <i>in Mexico right on time.</i>
- Excuse me.

616
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,249
When's the meal coming around?
I'm starved.

617
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:01,080
As a way to keep ticket prices low,

618
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:04,233
we have removed the in-flight meal
from our service package.

619
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,292
What's left on the
service package?

620
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:09,327
Pretzels and bags
of Krispity Krunch.

621
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:10,842
Pretzels.

622
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:13,568
Just a few minutes.

623
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,223
Freshen me up
when you get a chance, darlin'.

624
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:22,472
Right away, Dr. Stammel.

625
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,543
Dede's doing real good.

626
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:32,421
She's responding
to the meds,

627
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:34,387
eating.

628
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:37,399
She's going to be okay.

629
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:43,801
Because of you.

630
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:47,531
She's going to be okay
because of you.

631
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:51,498
I need to know...

632
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:56,155
...that you forgive me.

633
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,638
I know that. Of course I forgive you.

634
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,477
You know when Dede
was like four,

635
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,836
she wanted to watch this video.

636
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:09,990
And I kept telling her you know,
"After the game, after the game, okay?"

637
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:12,289
She kept asking
and kept asking,

638
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,378
and I lost my patience
and I snapped at her.

639
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:15,956
I snapped at her real bad.

640
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:18,861
She went over into the corner, and...

641
00:37:21,548 --> 00:37:23,842
I didn't even go over
and say anything.

642
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:27,275
Why are you getting yourself upset
over something that happened

643
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:29,785
years ago, baby? Dede loves you.

644
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,344
I want you to do something for me.

645
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,301
I want you to tell her

646
00:37:34,116 --> 00:37:35,116
that I'm sorry.

647
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,170
I'm so sorry.

648
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:39,776
And that my baby girls means
everything to me...

649
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:43,088
I want you to tell her
that she means everything to me, okay?

650
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:44,916
You tell her that every day.

651
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:46,721
- Time.
- No matter what...

652
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:49,782
Tell her. Tell her, okay?

653
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,388
No matter what, you promise that, okay?

654
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,610
Please, please, you got to tell her.

655
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,905
- You have to tell her...
- Okay, okay.

656
00:37:58,131 --> 00:37:59,553
You really have to go.

657
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:24,866
<i>All spectators
must remain behind
the barricades at all times.</i>

658
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:29,176
<i>The President will
be arriving shortly.</i>

659
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:35,008
Got a Boom Charlie half block south.

660
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:37,722
- Team leader wants you there right now.
- What's the M. O.?

661
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:39,487
He's got an IED strapped to...

662
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:48,500
He asked you to come
to this fountain specifically?

663
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:49,615
Yeah.

664
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,364
Let me take a look
at that park map.

665
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,753
Why not the fountain on
the east side of the park?

666
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:03,205
Because this one's closer
to the pay phone he called me on.

667
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,045
No, because this one's closer to them.

668
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:08,007
They tell you to meet them
at the statue.

669
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:09,226
Then the fountain.

670
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:13,029
Then they send you to the building
across the park.

671
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:14,479
Why?

672
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:18,529
'Cause they want to keep
you in their sights.

673
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,235
Because they're watching you.

674
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:23,091
But from where?

675
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:24,901
Statue, fountain, building...

676
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:29,353
There.

677
00:39:34,002 --> 00:39:35,354
You know what you have?

678
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:37,605
I think we have a pretty good idea.

679
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:39,003
What you doing?

680
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,904
Getting all unique data
from the memory key

681
00:39:40,905 --> 00:39:43,224
so we can identify this key
from any other,

682
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:46,044
label it, start a proper record
of a chain of custody

683
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,105
to present to the judges
I trust.

684
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:56,303
What's wrong?

685
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:59,477
It's the date stamp on the memory key.

686
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:00,976
It's the copy date.

687
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:02,811
I'm sorry, what's that?

688
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:04,713
It's the date the damn thing was copied,

689
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,720
not the date that the conversation
was originally recorded.

690
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:09,138
So what?

691
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:10,778
I mean, you heard what was on the tape.

692
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:12,953
Without a time stamp of exactly

693
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,380
when this conversation took place,

694
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:18,586
we can't prove
that this is Terrence Steadman talking

695
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:20,474
after you supposedly killed him.

696
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:23,424
This could have happened
a year before
his funeral.

697
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,597
No, it can't be authenticated,
so it can't be

698
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:29,351
admitted to any court as evidence.

699
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:32,221
People died because of this.
My family died.

700
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:33,911
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:38,621
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

702
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:50,505
Have either of these men checked in?

703
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:53,944
- No, not that I've seen.
- What about this woman?

704
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:56,656
Yeah.

705
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
Room 1006.

706
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:07,815
It's not over.

707
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:10,465
- We're this close.
- You already said it's done.

708
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:13,784
Actually, I said it couldn't help
exonerate you in a court of law.

709
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,818
Maybe it can help you outside the law.

710
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,388
How?

711
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:21,892
Well, we all heard the conversation.

712
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:24,395
There's more to this tape
than potential proof

713
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,748
of Lincoln's innocence.

714
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:28,624
There is proof
of Caroline Reynold's guilt.

715
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:31,002
Guilt about something
that she does not want

716
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:32,816
anyone to know anything about.

717
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,908
So we blackmail her.

718
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:38,959
I'm an officer of the court.

719
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:40,295
I didn't say that.

720
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,138
Blackmail in exchange for what?

721
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:45,763
A presidential pardon.

722
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,544
The woman that set me up...

723
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,701
is going to set me free.

724
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:55,152
I think she'll sign it
with her own hand.

725
00:41:57,755 --> 00:42:00,225
<i>Ace Team, Beta Team,
this is Leader One.</i>

726
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:09,042
<i>The Squaw will reach Home Base
in T minus two minutes.</i>

727
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,371
I love you.

728
00:42:34,164 --> 00:42:36,888
