1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,023
<i>Previously, on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,180
<i>What are the charges?</i>

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,280
<i>Attempted murder.</i>

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,429
<i>He's also being arraigned for the murder
of his mother and his stepfather.</i>

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,857
Don't look at me like I'm some con.

6
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:10,930
You're as crooked as Scoliosis.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
I don't get caught.

8
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:15,083
- This is as far as you go.
- Come on, bro.

9
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,989
You and I, we're not bros.

10
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,440
When were you planning on
telling us about the money, man?

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,341
What money?

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,106
The $5 million that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

13
00:00:29,607 --> 00:00:31,560
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,587
He's alive.

15
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:34,594
What are you talking about,
you found Steadman?

16
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:35,535
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:44,201
My hand has been in that box
for hours now. It is dying.

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,377
I can promise you nothing.

19
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:46,716
Story of my life.

20
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:48,257
These?

21
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,960
Keys to a car that's waiting for us
a couple hundred yards from here.

22
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,368
Are there 2 of us or 5 of us?

23
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:54,608
That's the two of us.

24
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:56,471
We got company!

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,219
How did he know?

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,188
<i>It's only a matter of time
before we know everything</i>

27
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,266
<i>that is in Scofield's head.</i>

28
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,503
<i>where he plans to run to,</i>

29
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:05,796
<i>how he plans to get there,</i>

30
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,400
<i>so when the time comes
that he does get there,</i>

31
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,799
we'll be waiting for him.

32
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:14,300
<i>Canadian and Mexican border patrols
have all the mug shots.</i>

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,700
<i>Bortac's on high alert.</i>

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,759
See if we can get
the Mexican border patrol

35
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:19,669
to set up checkpoints 50 miles in.

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,165
<i>The warden over at Fox River called,
asked to be kept in the loop.</i>

37
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:24,361
<i>What should I tell him?</i>

38
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:25,997
That he's no longer in it.

39
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,973
That info that you asked for
is on your desk when you get in.

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,089
<i>Thank you.</i>

41
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,419
What's the plan, man?

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,431
No bars on these doors.
Do what you like.

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,206
With what?

44
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,086
We're supposed to be in Mexico
right now.

45
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:56,094
Sipping on margaritas, waiting for
the heat to dip. That was the plan.

46
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,116
You see, they just used us to dig, man.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,441
We're gophers.

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,520
- Where's Michael?
- He'll be here.

49
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,313
- Okay.
- You know what, Sucre?

50
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,908
Maybe you and I should go
and get that $5 million,

51
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:07,749
Know what I'm saying?

52
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,790
I mean, it's just sitting there
in Tooele, Utah, ready to get some air.

53
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:12,368
You all stay here, so shut your mouth!

54
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,010
You got one more time to touch me, man!

55
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,650
- All right, guys, chill.
- What?

56
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,375
Relax.

57
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,650
Honey, are you sure
you packed everything?

58
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:43,496
Yummy.

59
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:53,047
Our photos are in the paper.

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,460
We're probably all over the news.

61
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,169
Yeah, and you didn't see that coming?

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,007
What's so funny?

63
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,293
The two of you, cracks me up.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,028
Here's to amateur hour.
What do you say, saludo?

65
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,861
Yeah, yuck it up, funny man.

66
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,425
Last Supper, boys.

67
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,094
This is the part where we say good bye.

68
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,381
It's not much.

69
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,122
It's enough to get you started.

70
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:30,806
No.

71
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,856
I'm not telling you where Fibonacci is.

72
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,390
Well, I didn't ask.

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,733
I only ask for a quarter
for a phone call.

74
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,203
Make forward.

75
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,227
Thank you.

76
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,542
I wonder what happened
to the other guys.

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,967
They all had a head-start, except T-Bag.

78
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,637
Yeah, he was,
he was bleeding pretty bad.

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,826
Think he's dead?

80
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:07,547
Are you done?

81
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,245
No. I...

82
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,678
I still have to clean it.

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,963
But you're done?

84
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,551
Yes.

85
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,301
It's time to move.

86
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,507
We got everything we need.

87
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,347
Just a quick stop in Utah
and then we're off to Mexico.

88
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,327
L.J. has a hearing today to determine
if he gets tried as an adult.

89
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,400
I can get him.

90
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,220
It's not the right time.

91
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,313
- When will it be?
- After we go to Mexico.

92
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,648
After we're off the news.

93
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,220
They framed him for a double homicide.

94
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,535
As soon as he loses his hearing,

95
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,561
they're gonna ship him out
to an adult facility,

96
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:04,283
so today in the courthouse
is my only chance to get him.

97
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,646
They took Veronica,
they're not going to take my son.

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,367
I know.

99
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,969
I would never leave L.J. behind,

100
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,565
but we can't do this now.

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,624
There's no plan in place.

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,830
Believe me, I know that courthouse.

103
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,901
I've been there more times
than I can remember.

104
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,637
The only one guarding him's the bailiff.

105
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:26,179
He carries mace and a big stick.

106
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,272
So you're going to bum-rush
the courthouse, that's your plan.

107
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,149
Are you serious?

108
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,333
Yeah.

109
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,792
Hey, yo, we're headed out, man.

110
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,131
Well, good luck

111
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:39,416
to everyone.

112
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,471
- Stay out of trouble.
- Definitely.

113
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,877
This is it, buddy.

114
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,039
I hope you find the girl, buddy.

115
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,226
She is all I have,

116
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:54,174
I'll die trying.

117
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,299
Good luck.

118
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,916
You be easy, man.

119
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,917
- Adios.
- Cuidate.

120
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,401
Maybe we'll see each other again.

121
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,753
You never know, Michael.

122
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:16,834
You never know.

123
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,401
Tell me everything you know
about the courthouse.

127
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,029
A couple hours.

128
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,990
Eight of 'em, I still can't believe it.

130

work in the military the police force
and especially inside a male prison,

'cause look what you get.

132
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:39,682
Dr. Sweetcheeks leaves the door open
for Scofield and here we are.

133
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,708
Sounds like there's a little bit more
to the...

134
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,468
If Tancredi doesn't leave
her office door unlocked,

135
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:47,400
those eight dirtbags would be
in the SHU right now, okay?

136
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,494
Bottom line!

137
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:49,536
Brad.

138
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:52,907
- Any updates?
- None.

139
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,382
They were last seen
at that cemetery in Oswego.

140
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,450
- They'll get 'em.
- They'll get 'em.

141
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,070
It's been handed over to the F.B.I.

142
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,788
- That doesn't mean we can't work it.
- It does, actually.

143
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:04,364
You and I have been
pulled off the pursuit.

144
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:06,680
- Why?
- We're going to find out shortly.

145
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,660
We have to report to the DOC
headquarters. I'll meet you there.

146
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,526
Sir, we can get these guys.

147
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,173
Just give me a couple more days

148
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,950
- and I swear I'll...
- Brad!

149
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,424
We've got to go.

150
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:38,050
<i>No family with Patoshik, nothing?</i>

151
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,670
<i>Yeah, until about 4 years ago
when he killed them all.

152
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,270
Updated rap sheet on Apolskis!

153
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,073
Take a look when you get a chance.

154
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:09,689
Man, I'm so sorry.

155
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,500
My bad. My bad, bro.

156
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,691
Scott Kolbrenner.

158
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:44,760
It's this one here.

159
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,462
Don't touch the radio.

160
00:10:57,954 --> 00:10:59,750
Hi. I'm with the Des Moines Herald.

161
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,650
I'm covering the L.J. Burrows hearing.

162
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,507
What time does that start today?

163
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:21,843
Come on.

164
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:56,738
Thank you.

165
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:58,958
3:00. The hearing lasts a half hour max.

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,190
He'll be taken down to transport bay
at ten till they catch the 4:00 van.

167
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,720
So how do we get close to him?

168
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,632
Well, when I was locked up, I had
nothing to do except study the briefs.

169
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,813
Nick Savrinn's bar number is
on the front page of every one.

170
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,430
We want to talk to L.J., we just...

171
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,110
we pose as one of his attorneys.

172
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,240
Yeah.

173
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,720
<i>Hogwash.</i>

174
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,820
<i>That is absolute hogwash.</i>

175
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,443
Please answer the question.

176
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,700
How was Scofield able
to have exclusive access to you,

177
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,945
pull a shank on you,
and bind you to your chair,

178
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:28,784
the warden of the penitentiary?

179
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,391
I trusted him.

1
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:34,843
Obviously, he betrayed that trust.

2
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,891
Officer Bellick,

3
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:43,228
is it true that almost all the inmates
who either escaped or tried to escape

4
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:44,964
worked in prison industries?

5
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,198
That's right.

6
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:49,418
Why did these inmates have
so much time to dig a hole in the floor

7
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,123
of the guard's break room
while working prison industries?

8
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,888
I can answer that. With all due respect,

9
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:56,761
if any of you have ever worked a day
in a prison, you would know that

10
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,017
since an inmate only gets
19 cents an hour,

11
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,525
some are bound to drag their feet.

12
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,065
Officer Bellick,

13
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,567
is it true you sold the right
to run prison industries

14
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,850
to the highest bidder?

15
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,729
No. Who the hell told you that?

16
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:13,369
This is unbelievable.

17
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,510
While we're wasting time in here,

18
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:18,006
there are eight escaped convicts
out there...

19
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,894
Were you employed at Fox River
as a correctional officer, Mr. Geary?

20
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,851
Yep.

21
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:41,530
Yeah, until he was fired
for shaking down inmates.

22
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,063
That will be your last outburst,
officer.

23
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,136
Were you aware of any arrangement

24
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,790
officer Bellick had with any inmate
regarding prison industries?

25
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,654
Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.

26
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:55,184
John Abruzzi, who was one
of the escaped convicts?

27
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:56,689
Yep.

28
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,974
We'll get other C.Os to substantiate this

29
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:00,219
if we have to, officer Bellick,

30
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:02,766
so I'm giving you one chance
to get in front of it.

31
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,973
Did you sell prison industries
to John Abruzzi?

32
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,660
Yes or no?

33
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,098
Yes, but at no time was I aware...

34
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:16,028
- That'll be all.
- ...of any talk of escape.

35
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,326
That will be all!

36
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,239
Warden, you and officer Bellick
can step out into the hallway.

37
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,725
We'll call for you
when we've reached a decision.

38
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,374
I'm going to get some coffee.

39
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:57,490
Well, I did my best
under the circumstances.

40
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,624
The good news, sir,
is you had the hand iced,

41
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:03,060
so I was able to restore
blood flow and...

42
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,600
the bones are bent.

43
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:08,081
However, I recommend you get
medical attention asap.

44
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,490
Meanwhile, some Aspirin will help
thin the blood and avoid clotting.

45
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,163
Some antibiotics and painkillers.

46
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,327
I usually tell the owner of the dog,
cat, whatever,

47
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,765
to coat them with peanut butter
so they're easier to chew

48
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:23,080
but, obviously, in your case...

49
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,970
You did one hell of a job, doc.

50
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,341
Well, thank you.

51
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:28,780
Well...

52
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:30,369
It's okay for you to leave now.

53
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:31,945
Oh, I'm leaving.

54
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:34,432
You're not.

55
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:36,129
- What?
- You heard me.

56
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,264
Look, sir, I haven't seen anything
and I won't tell anyone.

57
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:40,570
Well, you know...

58
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:44,447
you know, I fell for that bill of goods
once before.

59
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,928
Never again.

60
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,303
Sir, I swear to God I will tell nobody.

61
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,178
You would, and I would die in prison.

62
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,775
Please, please, please.

63
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,222
Now, you did me a solid,
so I'm going to return the favor.

64
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,564
This can go down humanely
if you don't fight,

65
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,388
but if you pull a stunt like that again,

66
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,359
it's going to get inhumane right quick.

67
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,525
Your call.

68
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:19,262
But, one way or another...

69
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,470
I am putting you down, doc.

70
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,640
<i>- Lincoln Burrows Junior. - Yeah.</i>

71
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,402
<i>In here, you got a visitor.</i>

72
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,665
You must be L.J.

73
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:54,978
Agent Mahone, F.B.I.

74
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,540
Thank you.

75
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,635
Please.

76
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:05,382
I'm assuming you've heard.

77
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:07,889
Yeah.

78
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,198
I have to tell you.

79
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,554
What your dad and uncle pulled off...

80
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:15,057
very impressive.

81
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:17,131
I've been doing this 14 years,

82
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,879
and most escapes can be attributed
to dumb luck or brute force.

83
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,987
The level of planning and sophistication
that went into this one,

84
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,638
and eight guys got out.

85
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,970
I really do, professionally speaking,

86
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:34,728
have a lot of admiration
for Lincoln and Michael.

87
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:37,358
Cool. Now we're buddies.

88
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,512
What do you need?

89
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,610
Help me bring them in...

90
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,524
peacefully.

91
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,302
I don't know where they are.

92
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,180
I don't know where they're going.

93
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,020
There's another way you can help.

94
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:54,143
- How?
- Go on TV.

95
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,502
I can have a camera crew down here
in a half an hour.

96
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:06,071
You know what, man?

97
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,900
The murder charge they put on my dad,

98
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:10,140
the two murder charges they put on me,

99
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,120
everything's been a setup
coming from way up top.

100
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,920
So the fact that you work
for the government...

101
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,510
I got nothing to say.

102
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,463
I'll give you the same advice

103
00:18:27,502 --> 00:18:30,029
that you'd get from the guy
working at the deli downstairs.

104
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,620
Start thinking about yourself now.

105
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:35,796
In fact, the sooner the better,
because no one,

106
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:38,593
not your father, L.J., not your uncle

107
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,497
is going to do your time.

108
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,453
And, at 16 years old,
you're looking at a long stretch.

109
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,818
How much time you get,
where you serve it,

110
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:50,905
who your cell mate might be.

111
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,370
You need to start
thinking about yourself. Now.

112
00:18:58,674 --> 00:19:01,857
I want your dad, I want your uncle,
and I'm willing to deal.

113
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,679
Don't wait and let someone else
get the reward.

114
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,352
What's up?

115
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,813
Hey, man, you look familiar.

116
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,169
Did you rush Sig ep last semester?

117
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,918
- Sig what?
- Sig Ep.

118
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,793
- No.
- Next in line.

119
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,770
Where to?

120
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:46,352
Utah.

121
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:02,671
How we doing here?

122
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,604
Nothing until tomorrow.

123
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,189
All right, yo, I got 45 bucks.

124
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,932
How far will that get me?

125
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:28,320
Nick Savrinn.

126
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:30,370
Bar number is 56437.

127
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:33,148
I've got a call time with my client,
L.J. Burrows.

128
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,113
Hello.

129
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,367
Know who this is?

130
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:43,261
Yeah.

131
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:45,471
Yeah, Nick Savrinn.

132
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,195
How you holding on?

133
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,400
Doing what I can do.

134
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,501
<i>How about you?</i>

135
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,587
I'm worried about you.

136
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,738
I'm sorry about
what you're going through.

137
00:20:55,778 --> 00:20:57,491
<i>Thanks.</i> Word is...

138
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:01,157
after this hearing, because of my dad
being so high profile,

139
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:02,932
they're...

140
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,911
They're shipping me to an adult facility
in Kingman, Arizona.

141
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,882
Yeah, well, hopefully,
that ain't gonna happen.

142
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,828
You hear from Veronica today?

143
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,510
<i>She didn't show up.</i>

144
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:16,042
They gave me some court-appointed clown.

145
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:17,820
No.

146
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,072
I haven't heard from her.

147
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,080
<i>Hey, this...</i>

148
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,345
this fed came by and talked to me today.

149
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,880
Yeah?

150
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,510
<i>He wanted me to help try
in getting my dad to turn himself in.</i>

151
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,213
Well, knowing your dad,
I doubt that's gonna happen.

152
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,525
Listen up, L.J.. This is real important.

153
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,838
All right.

154
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,811
On the third, look out for Otis Wright.

155
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,310
<i>You got that?</i>

156
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:41,128
<i>On the third, look out for Otis Wright.</i>

157
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,125
Until then, keep you head up.

158
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,170
What?

159
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:45,465
<i>Just remember that.</i>

160
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,740
I'm going to do
everything I can to get you out.

161
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,927
Hey, Nick...

162
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,154
if you talk to my dad...

163
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,225
<i>tell him no matter what, I love him.</i>

164
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,282
Did you get him?

165
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,870
Let's do this.

166
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:09,141
Got one more stop.

167
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:23,029
There is a belief in my religion
which I know to be true

168
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,473
and it applies to everyone,
Hindu or not.

169
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:31,110
The acts we commit in this life
determine where we go in the next.

170
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:35,090
And he who commits evil
can never hope for eternal happiness.

171
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,360
Never been a goal of mine, doc.

172
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,467
I'm more a here and now type.

173
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,936
I'll tell you something I know is true.

174
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:49,103
The Indians here,

175
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,624
the Tomahawk variety,

176
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,891
some of them believe... well,

177
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,849
used to believe before
most of them were slaughtered,

178
00:22:56,915 --> 00:23:01,880
that when a warrior
kills another in battle,

1
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,273
he absorbs that fallen warrior's spirit.

2
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,947
So this isn't the end for you, doc.

3
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,927
You're with me now.

4
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,270
And how are you doing in this fine day?

5
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:34,659
I'm great. How are you?

6
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,929
Couldn't be better.

7
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,174
Anything in particular
I can help you find?

8
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:39,871
Just looking, thanks.

9
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,660
Well, if you need any assistance,
just give a holler.

10
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:12,040
- How are we in this find day?
- Great.

11
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,059
Can I help you find anything?

12
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,670
I'm good, thanks.

13
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:22,425
We gotta go.

14
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,490
- I just need to pay up.
- Now.

15
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,250
How are you today, officer?

16
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:32,723
Yeah, they were right, uh...

17
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,380
well, they were...
they were right back here.

18
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:44,607
We can make it to the courthouse
on foot from here.

19
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:47,260
You don't understand...
everything is in that car.

20
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:50,550
Forget the damn car. We don't have time.
Come on, man, let's go.

21
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:12,120
Hi.

22
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:52,602
It is the finding of this panel
that warden Pope,

23
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,830
you'll be docked two weeks,
placed on three months probation.

24
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,498
Officer Brad Bellick,

25
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:01,641
will be terminated.
Effective immediately.

26
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,525
Mr. Bellick, you can retrieve whatever
belongings you may have from Fox River.

27
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,830
That will be all.

28
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,420
I've...

29
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:13,839
I've worked at Fox River
since I was 18 years old.

30
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,861
Being a C. O. is my life.

31
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:17,929
And we appreciate that.

32
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,571
Look, we could have saved a lot of time

33
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,602
if you would have just told us
in the beginning

34
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:24,120
- that this was gonna be a railroad.
- That'll be all, warden.

35
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,739
There is only one person
responsible for this escape out there.

36
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,615
His name is Michael Scofield.
It's not officer Bellick.

37
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,131
It's not me!

38
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,720
But you need a fall guy, fine.

39
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,850
But you're not gonna be just
taking officer Bellick's job.

40
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,090
Because even though I am not proud
of many of his actions,

41
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,440
it will be a cold day in hell
when I turn my back on 1 of my own men.

42
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,154
I quit.

43
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:49,634
That will be all.

44
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,750
If this thing doesn't work out
and you end up going back to Fox River,

45
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,940
I ain't coming to get ya.

46
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,763
I mean, you are the brains
and I am the brute.

47
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,190
Seriously, Michael,
you don't have to do this.

48
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:25,341
Let's go.

49
00:28:57,793 --> 00:28:58,790
We're good.

50
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,619
You got a call from Nick Savrinn
earlier today. What was that all about?

51
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,673
He's my attorney. That's privileged.

52
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:10,389
That's odd because Nick Savrinn
was found dead in his apartment

53
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:12,760
an hour before that call came in to you.

54
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,139
<i>- Listen up, LJ, this is real important.
- All right.</i>

55
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,119
<i>On the third, look out
for Otis Wright.</i>

56
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,122
<i>You got that?</i>

57
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,675
You know, for someone who's
so convinced that the government

58
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:24,495
is capable of so many
underhanded things,

59
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,600
you sure are playing
fast and loose with me.

60
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,766
What are you going to do, throw
another fake murder charge on me?

61
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:31,160
Who's Otis Wright?

62
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,559
- I have no idea.
- I think you do.

63
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:36,321
And if you don't tell me,
after you're convicted,

64
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,553
I will be in that courtroom
when you're sentenced

65
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,257
and I will hang you out to dry.

66
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,161
Take it to the bank.

67
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,555
Yeah.

68
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:33,645
Put me in touch with the prosecutor
in the LJ Burrows case.

69
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,282
I want a meeting.

70
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,620
<i>On the third, look out
for Otis Wright.</i>

71
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:53,524
<i>Until then, keep your head up.</i>

72
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,775
<i>Otis Wright.</i>

73
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,427
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

74
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,020
- Move it.
- Hold on.

75
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,411
I'll escort the boy.

76
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:57,039
Otis Wright.

77
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,780
Otis elevator on the right.

78
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,290
What is he planning?

79
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:05,063
Keep it in the holster
and no one gets hurt.

80
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,870
Keep it in the holster.

81
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:12,730
All right, LJ, hit stop.

82
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:16,822
He's coming with us.

83
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,260
So just stay cool, stay cool.

84
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:22,868
Hey, buddy,

85
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:24,549
give me his gun.

86
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:39,500
LJ, give me your hand.

87
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:42,300
That a boy. Come on.

88
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:51,136
Hey! Back off!

89
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,688
Back off! Back off!

90
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,590
I'm not shooting anybody,
neither are you.

91
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,642
Give yourself up and your kid can walk.

92
00:32:56,697 --> 00:32:58,747
It's the only way
he's getting out of this place.

93
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,489
It's the only way!

94
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:02,250
Dad!

95
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:10,219
- Dad, you gotta let me go.
- No.

96
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:16,720
You gotta let me go!

97
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:30,049
Up there. Scofield is in the building.
Take him!

98
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,542
You guys go, cover that way!

99
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:34,344
Scofield and Burrows
are in the building!

100
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,581
Come on.

101
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,059
Freeze! Do not move!

102
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,430
Truck!

103
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,148
Stop!

104
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:45,695
Bradley?

105
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,676
Yeah, ma.

106
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,724
What are you doing home so early?

107
00:34:51,835 --> 00:34:53,352
I had to take...

108
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:58,385
my personal day, you know,
before they went away.

109
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:01,500
Shouldn't you be looking
for the convicts?

110
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:04,950
Well, they got somebody else
doing that, mom.

111
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:06,608
You okay?

112
00:35:17,688 --> 00:35:18,863
I'm good.

113
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:21,017
Okay.

114
00:36:30,997 --> 00:36:32,008
All right.

115
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:35,168
I think we should break
a bottle of champagne across its bow.

116
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:38,234
If you're intending to get this thing
home for your anniversary tonight,

117
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:40,134
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- No.

118
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,599
Listen, I want you to know I...

119
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,570
well, I feel very fortunate
to have met you.

120
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,867
I'm breaking out.

121
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:57,680
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.

122
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:19,440
<i>Thank you for calling Autostar, dr...</i>

123
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,979
<i>Gudat? Am I pronouncing that correctly?</i>

124
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:24,430
Dead on.

125
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,240
<i>How can help you today?</i>

126
00:38:26,897 --> 00:38:28,455
I need...

127
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:30,397
directions.

128
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,065
<i>Where to, sir?</i>

129
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:33,295
Utah.

130
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:47,750
<i>Excuse me.</i>

131
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:49,560
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

132
00:38:49,808 --> 00:38:51,290
Are you Scott Kolbrenner?

133
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,070
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

134
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,734
You must be Debra Jean.

135
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,019
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, same here.

136
00:39:00,024 --> 00:39:02,461
It's so funny. I was almost ready
to leave when you called.

137
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:03,799
No one else responded.

138
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,129
I guess there's not a lot
of Utah people out here.

139
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:07,404
Are you from there?

140
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,595
No, I just, you know...

141
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:11,303
I'm headed up there to

142
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,171
collect an inheritance.

143
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,129
My grandpa died.

144
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,119
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's alright.

145
00:39:17,143 --> 00:39:18,961
He went out with his boots on.

146
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:21,312
So where's your stuff?

147
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,185
I mailed it yesterday.

148
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,758
Mailed it? I've never heard of that.

149
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,262
You know, you don't wanna lug it around.

150
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:32,010
Plus, I got a boy who works for UPS,
so he hooked it up.

151
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,940
So you wanna bounce?

152
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,094
I'm parked out front.

153
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,510
<i>Bradley?</i>

154
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,441
Yeah, ma.

155
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,856
<i>They've just announced
the rewards on the tv.</i>

156
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:03,715
What reward?

157
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:07,300
<i>The convicts. For the convicts...
the ones who escaped.</i>

158
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:11,769
<i>- How much? - $100,000 apiece.</i>

159
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:15,930
<i>$300,000 for the animal who killed
president Reynolds' brother.</i>

160
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:20,556
<i>Every whacko in the country is gonna be
after those bums now, wouldn't you say?</i>

161
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,270
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up!

162
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,710
- We gotta move.
- I can't.

163
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,200
Oh, my God.

164
00:41:05,194 --> 00:41:06,397
I failed him.

165
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:16,997
I failed him.

166
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:24,610
I sure hope you packed a lunch.

167
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,962
It's gonna be a long ride to Arizona.

168
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,602
Move your ass.

169
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,469
Get men in all the area hospitals.

170
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,703
Wherever they are,
one of them is bleeding good.

171
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,171
Which means,

172
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:04,070
they either come to us,

173
00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:05,901
or they die.
