1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,907
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:02,618
- Where is it?
- Go to hell.

3
00:00:02,748 --> 00:00:03,945
You did this to yourself.

4
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:06,686
<i>Sara, if you're listening,</i>

5
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:09,239
<i>I only hope, by now,
you've found your safe haven.</i>

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,393
<i>I took advantage of you,
put you in a place</i>

7
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:13,294
<i>that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

8
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:15,055
Sara Tancredi. You know her well?

9
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,305
I'd know her a lot better
if you can get my ass moved.

10
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:20,007
- I'll talk to the warden.
- "Another Chance" and "Safe Haven."

11
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,859
Those are the names of some
of the chapters

12
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,448
in the book they use in AA.

13
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,315
Don't make no mistake about it.

14
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:29,177
We will be a family if it kills us.

15
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:31,034
That's your map?

16
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,277
What happened to your arm?

17
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,395
My dad drinks, too.

18
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,483
My tummy hurts.

19
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:41,877
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

20
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,562
Case is going into the system now.

21
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:44,795
Aiding an escaped con.

22
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,400
Tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in.

23
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,698
Kacee said you need to run.

24
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,346
If you get busted or turn yourself in,

25
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:50,950
Dede won't have either of you.

26
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,505
Michael, I want for this to be over.

27
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,559
That makes two of us.

28
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,252
It's just a question of looking
at whatever your father gave you.

29
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:57,294
It's just a key.

30
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,385
If I may, sir, the president...

31
00:00:59,474 --> 00:01:00,650
she could be useful.

32
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:01,877
Madam President?

33
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,149
<i>I want you to come home, Paul.</i>

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,762
<i>But not with those brothers
running around the country.</i>

35
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:11,171
- Caroline...
<i>- Bring them in, Paul, and everything</i>

36
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,875
<i>can go back to the way it was.</i>

37
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:39,510
Agent Kellerman.

38
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:40,933
<i>Paul, where are you?

39
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:43,315
Out in the cold. Remember?

40
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:45,240
<i>I'm speaking in Chicago tonight.</i>

41
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:01,461
Lincoln.

42
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:02,997
Sara.

43
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:06,503
It's funny how you only call me
when you need me.

44
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:10,067
- Maybe "funny" is not the right word.
- <i>All of this can go away, Paul.</i>

45
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:12,659
Can it?

46
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,012
Yes. I'm
the President of the United States.

47
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:19,742
<i>Please just come back to Chicago
and turn Burrows and Scofield in.</i>

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,874
<i>I promise you that I will make
everything go back to the way it was.</i>

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,978
I have to go.

50
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,797
<i>Just come back, Paul.</i>

51
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,990
<i>I need you.</i>

52
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:34,265
You actually think we have a shot?

53
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,678
It depends on what your father gave you.

54
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,309
This fell out of his pocket
when I found him.

55
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,511
I don't recognize the insignia, do you?

56
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:45,809
No.

57
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,313
But...

58
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,658
Sara, we've got someone
working with us now.

59
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:06,347
Good morning, sunshine.

60
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,954
How did you sleep?

61
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:19,775
I'll tell you what.

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,290
I'll go unlock the kids
and make us all breakfast.

63
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,687
No. I'll get the kids.

64
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:26,350
- No...
- I insist.

65
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,883
No.

66
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:47,846
I'll get the kids.

67
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:54,894
Some hand cream will make
those rope burns feel better.

68
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:56,808
It won't work.

69
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,317
'Course it will.

70
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,551
Says right here on the bottle:
"Soothes skin

71
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,512
- "irritations and..."
- No. This.

72
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:04,802
It won't work. I've got a job.

73
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,227
The kids have school.

74
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:08,928
We're all going to get back
to our normal routines

75
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:12,114
once this little adjustment period
is over.

76
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,535
There's someone coming over today.

77
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:15,136
- Who?
- This woman, Patty,

78
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:16,690
from the Welcome Wagon Committee.

79
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,738
Call her and cancel.

80
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,150
I don't have her number.

81
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,311
And, if she shows up,
and I don't answer the door,

82
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:24,308
she's going to know something's wrong.

83
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,291
Teddy...

84
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,121
Teddy Bear...

85
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:38,902
You need to go.

86
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:42,859
If she recognizes you...

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,935
I don't want you to get in trouble.

88
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,242
That's nonsense.

89
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:58,996
It's no trouble.

90
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,143
No trouble at all.

91
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:15,719
Hi, Sara.

92
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,268
What's done is done.
We all want the same thing.

93
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,474
You didn't tell us you left her to die.

94
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,618
I was scaring her.

95
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,193
I was going to pull her out.

96
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:31,717
No. No, you left me in there to drown.

97
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:34,092
I wonder how long
you can hold your breath.

98
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,395
Maybe we should find out.

99
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,125
You need me, and you know it.

100
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,864
You need me. You need me.

101
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:44,911
Why? Why do we need him?
We have the key.

102
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,617
We'll find out what it's for.

103
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:49,431
I can tell you
what that key's for right now.

104
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,323
It's to a private cigar club.

105
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:56,123
Where?

106
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:58,828
Chicago.

107
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:06,112
Transcript: swsub.com & FRM

108
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,149
We have to hurry.

109
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:38,099
We have to hurry, Larry.
I did a bad thing.

110
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:42,810
God! I did a very bad thing.

111
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,541
All gas stations.

112
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,916
On 80, 30, 77.

113
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:53,986
I want Scofield's and Burrows' pictures

114
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,575
on each and every gas pump.

115
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,945
If they have no fuel,
they can't get anywhere.

116
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,152
- Sir?
- What?

117
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,402
We might need to divert

118
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,698
our attention away from
Scofield and Burrows for a while.

119
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:03,875
Why would I do that?

120
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,652
Because one of the other escapees
just killed a civilian.

121
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,660
A man fitting his description

122
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,119
was spotted running
from the scene of a brutal homicide.

123
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,141
Happened in Algoma, Wisconsin,

124
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,710
less than four hours from the prison.

125
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,163
Call the field office in Maddison,

126
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,392
and have them get some agents out there
the right away.

127
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:22,731
Ok. I'll notify the headquarters.

128
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,081
I didn't said headquarters. I said...
are you not following direct orders?

129
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:28,742
Oh I'm following direct orders, sir.

130
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,775
Just not from you anymore.

131
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,142
Everythings go from headquarters
from now on.

132
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:38,688
May I?

133
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:49,798
Yeah.

134
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:51,727
You heard about Patoshik.

135
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,972
Just now.

136
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:54,948
<i>Good.</i>

137
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:56,598
He goes.

138
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:59,540
Come on, the man is mentaly hill,
he doesn't know anything he's not...

139
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,957
Patoshik was one of
Scofield's cellmate for a while.

140
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:05,055
Scofield included him in the escape.
Who knows what he knows.

141
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,579
Scofield and Burrows are still out...

142
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,610
don't worry
about Scofield and Burrows righ now.

143
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:11,876
So, again...

144
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:14,518
Patoshik goes.

145
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,870
Take care of it.

146
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:23,147
Hi, are you in charge of seating?

147
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,185
Yeah, can I help you

148
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,089
Agent Paul Kellerman, Secret Service.

149
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:28,284
I'm transporting a fugitive to Chicago.

150
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:29,943
I need you to clear a car for me.

151
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:30,954
A fugive?

152
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:32,375
That's right.

153
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,797
Well, I see if that work.
We're already near capacity.

154
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,268
You want him to rub elbows
with the other passengers?

155
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:38,352
- No, sir.
- Okay.

156
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,103
What's he wanted for?

157
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:41,606
Killing people.

158
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Good Lord.

159
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:44,508
Make it happen.

160
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:45,617
Come on, follow me.

161
00:08:58,278 --> 00:08:59,278
It'gonna be all right.

162
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:03,887
If you say so.

163
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:07,677
We use him to get what we need,

164
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:09,830
Then we dump him.

165
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:13,856
Okay.

166
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:21,499
I'sorry you got involved in this.

167
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:25,323
The fact that you're helping us...

168
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I means a lot.

169
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Thank you.

170
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:38,110
The other riders aren't in any danger,
are they?

171
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,702
I mean,
should make an announcement or anything?

172
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:41,982
You want pandemonium?

173
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:45,080
- No, sir.
- Ok, then no announcements, right?

174
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:48,087
Just keep everybody out of this car
then everything is jake.

175
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,534
I've done this a million times.

176
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:50,711
Never had a problem.

177
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Okay, will do.

178
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,152
Let's go.

179
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,990
We'll be in Chicago in about five hours.

180
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,832
You want to get some rest.

181
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:38,931
You okay?

182
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:41,502
Yeah.

183
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:57,472
Brad.

184
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,073
You do no look to good.

185
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:00,637
I helped you with Sara Tancredi,

186
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,150
and you were supposed
to get me into Ad Seg.

187
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,335
I tried.

188
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:07,583
But your new warden...

189
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,142
He's straight as an arrow.

190
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:15,191
But I might be able to do you
one better than Ad Seg.

191
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:20,574
You found Scofield and Burrows through
the Russian girl, right?

192
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,234
Yeah, Nika. Why?

193
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:24,578
And you tracked down Bagwell

194
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:27,084
by following Susan Hollander.

195
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,218
Yeah. And I blow my nose
with my right hand

196
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,974
and I wipe my ass with my left.

197
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:32,975
What of it?

198
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:42,769
I've got very powerful people behind me
that want me to finish my job.

199
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:45,903
They can push through the quickest

200
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:48,705
habeas corpus proceedings the courts
have ever seen.

201
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,802
Paperwork's sitting
on the right person's desk as we speak

202
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,595
setting forth all

203
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,837
the Constitutional violations
in your prosecussion.

204
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:02,006
It's just waiting to be rubber-stamped.

205
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,887
And what do I have to do?

206
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,150
You just find those cons.

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Only this time...

208
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:13,044
you're gonna do it for me--

209
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:16,655
unofficially, under the radar,
no paper trail...

210
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,204
I need a junk yard dog who's willing
to do the ugly things

211
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:25,453
it takes to bring a con to justice.

212
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,534
Are you my dog, Brad?

213
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:35,686
Damn hell, yeah, I am.

214
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:41,863
This is delicious!

215
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:43,396
What'd you call it again?

216
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:45,325
That, my dear Patty-cake,

217
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:48,253
is what my auntie back in 'Bama
used to call "hobo chicken."

218
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,591
One part chicken, two parts spice,
three part actual hobo.

219
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,714
I know, uh, uh... fowl

220
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:03,293
isn't part of
a traditional brunch, per se,

221
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,898
but I have found a lean meat

222
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:08,977
can act as an aperitif to, uh...

223
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:13,485
awaken the pallet for more subtle

224
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,750
flavors and textures,

225
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,313
such as...

226
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,525
Mama mia!

227
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,816
Pumpkin cinnamon breads
with fresh strawberries and cream.

228
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,880
Oh, boy!

229
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,725
Now, how did you two meet?

230
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:31,525
Church.

231
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:36,157
After my, uh... accident,

232
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,996
I was volunteering
with some other amputees.

233
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,981
My parish back home

234
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,906
did an exchange program

235
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:47,542
with churches all over this fine country
and... well...

236
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,138
the good Lord just saw fit to plop
my country rump

237
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,588
right down in the pew
beside my Susie Q.

238
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,997
And you just stole her heart.

239
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:00,091
I'm a regular one-armed bandit.

240
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:01,925
A one-armed bandit...

241
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,553
Mrs. Wallace, Teddy just
bought me a brand-new bike.

242
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,005
It's out in the garage. Wanna go see?

243
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,163
Sure.

244
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:13,459
We have got company.

245
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,257
Oh, that's okay.

246
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,058
No, it's not; it's rude.
Zack knows better.

247
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,458
Isn't that right?

248
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,494
You do know better, Zack.

249
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,014
You gotta have discipline.

250
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,425
Without a strong father figure,

251
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,485
a young man might just end up in prison.

252
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,166
<i>Since you are such a fan </i>

253
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,959
<i>of lame store-bought blueberry pie,</i>

254
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,925
<i>I am gonna bake you a real pie...</i>

255
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,640
<i>Hi, my name's Lance and I'm an addict.</i>

256
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:16,670
<i>Hi, my name is not Lance,
I'm not an addict.</i>

257
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,348
Do you know if there's any way
I can get any water?

258
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,091
Yeah, I think there's
a bathroom downstairs.

259
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:38,853
- I'll check.
- Thanks.

260
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:53,897
It was never personal, Sara.

261
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:56,188
- War never is.
- Yeah.

262
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,531
You get one of those!
You get one of those.

263
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,658
One.

264
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,775
Down. Get down, right now.

265
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,054
What?

266
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:57,792
These three guys said they saw

267
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,747
what looked to be a fight
going on in there.

268
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,137
They didn't, all right?
Just get the train to Chicago.

269
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,430
Do I need to notify the police?

270
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,159
You need to do what I told you to do.

271
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,005
You take the tickets,
I'll watch the fugitive.

272
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,066
You can just continue to do bong hits,
or whatever you do back there, okay?

273
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,954
Now would you guys mind
your own business?

274
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:13,729
Everybody clear?

275
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,500
Great.

276
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:17,489
Don't interrupt again, please.

277
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,690
Just so we're all clear:

278
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:25,342
if she tries that again...

279
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,592
You'll do what?

280
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,708
Just stay on the other side of the car.

281
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:32,535
It wasn't personal, Paul.

282
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:28,177
Ooh! What're these?

283
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,665
I'm...

284
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,312
gonna do some renovations.

285
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:35,088
I was just tappin' the sheetrock,
lookin' for the stud.

286
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,827
Looks like you already found one.

287
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:39,128
Potty mouth!

288
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:45,443
Me and the girls get together
every Friday for book club.

289
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:49,216
You ought to host it this week
and everybody can meet you.

290
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:51,985
- I'll see you then!
- Can't wait.

291
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:59,121
This ain't ever gonna work here.

292
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:04,320
Go pack your things; we're movin'.

293
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,425
Now, hey, if you don't stop me,

294
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,285
I'm gonna eat this whole thing
by myself.

295
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:42,490
All right, sweetie, listen.

296
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,970
I'll make a deal with you.

297
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:47,363
Remember that merry-go-round
that we saw today?

298
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,527
You're not gonna get
a chance to ride it,

299
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:53,017
if you don't eat something. Go ahead.

300
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,273
I don't feel good.

301
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:04,864
Oh, sweetie.

302
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:10,546
Okay, come on. Let's go, all right?

303
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,210
I got you.

304
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:18,514
Okay, just hold on. Okay, sweet pea?

305
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,827
Check, please?

306
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,405
All right! Nobody move!

307
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,133
- Hey, Sara?
- Not now.

308
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:54,267
How is she?

309
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:57,430
She wants to be alone.

310
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:03,062
So we get what her dad locked away
with that key. What do we do then?

311
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:05,563
I mean... you saw what they did
with the tape we made.

312
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,527
They're gonna bury everything
we put out there.

313
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:09,623
That's why
we're keeping him close to us.

314
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:11,500
He's got a lot of connections
in Washington.

315
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:16,858
So we get to the cigar club,
open her dad's box...

316
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:19,719
what if the only thing inside's
a bunch of stogies?

317
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:23,323
I think
it's worth making the trip to find out.

318
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:41,104
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Caroline.

319
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:43,284
<i>Paul. Where are you?</i>

320
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,188
I need to know exactly what you meant

321
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:48,462
when you said
you were gonna make this right.

322
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:51,729
- I need specifics.
<i>- Where are you? What's that noise?</i>

323
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,210
I'm on a train.
I'll be in Chicago later today.

324
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,031
But I need to know specifics.

325
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:58,723
<i>Where are Burrows and Scofield?
Are they with you?</i>

326
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:01,523
Don't worry about them; worry about me.

327
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,669
Paul, there are still positions
in my administration

328
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,462
that need to be filled--
including Chief of Staff.

329
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:09,346
I want that to be you.

330
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:11,950
When I get to Chicago, we'll meet.

331
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,608
We'll talk.

332
00:22:23,415 --> 00:22:24,810
All of it.

333
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:29,350
I just brought enough to get a sandwich.
I was sitting right there, okay?

334
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:31,331
If you're lying...

335
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:33,480
Look, my daughter is sick,
and I don't want to spend

336
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:35,357
any more minutes in here than necessary.

337
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,835
Trust me, that is all that I have.

338
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:47,288
What do you got, sweetheart?

339
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,469
What do you got?

340
00:22:57,571 --> 00:23:00,481
- You don't want to listen?
-Hey, hey, calm down, man.

341
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:02,374
- Shut up!
- All right.

342
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,181
Listen to me, you've got to calm down.

343
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,996
All right, I can help you get
everything that you want.

344
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:10,631
But you don't want to hurt anybody else,
right?

345
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:12,127
Come on.

346
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,265
Look, listen. Hey.

347
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:17,892
Why don't you go ahead
and lock the door,

348
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:19,204
and turn the closed sign back,

349
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:21,946
so everybody thinks
that this place is closed, all right?

350
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:24,767
And then, we can get everybody away
from the window.

351
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,323
Is that cool with you?

352
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:27,680
Everybody away from the window.

353
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,840
Let's move everybody
onto this side of the room.

354
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,184
Get on this side of the room.

355
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:33,428
Let's move to this side of the room
from the window.

356
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:35,331
Let's get on this side of the room.

357
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,414
This side of the room.

358
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,488
Why don't you take my daughter, okay?

359
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:40,777
Take her on this side of the room,
so that everybody...

360
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:42,277
Everything is gonna be okay.

361
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,046
Everything is gonna be fine.

362
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,821
Because you're not gonna put your hand
on another person, right?

363
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,627
- Right.
- We're all good.

364
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:52,900
Y'all good?

365
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:54,423
We're good, right?

366
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:01,497
- Hey, Sara?
- Come on in.

367
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:24,092
I've been sitting here evaluating.

368
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,108
I...

369
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:32,931
I jumped bail. I'm on the run,

370
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:37,186
and I just tried to take a man's life.

371
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,737
I'm not using.

372
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,977
Which is actually
quite an accomplishment.

373
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:52,168
But three weeks ago, I was a doctor.

374
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:56,529
You can get that back... all of it.

375
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,582
You need to believe that.

376
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:02,558
You believe that?

377
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:07,071
You think you can get it all back?

378
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,304
I choose to have faith.

379
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,073
Because without that, I'm nothing.

380
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:22,288
It's the only thing
that's keeping me going.

381
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,897
Well...
I got two things keeping me going.

382
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:33,954
First, is that I want the people
who killed my dad.

383
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:38,242
And actually, the second...

384
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:43,118
ironically, I probably wouldn't even say

385
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,960
if I hadn't lost him, but, um...

386
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,251
You should know that...

387
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:03,775
The first thing they tell you
when you take the job, is, um,

388
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,258
never to fall in love with an inmate.

389
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:02,535
What's going on?

390
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:19,893
Linc. It's locked.

391
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:56,187
Hey! You can't be in here.

392
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:07,154
- Run the roadblock.
- Man, I can't do that.

393
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,302
Run it!

394
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:46,829
Bradley Bellick, FBI.

395
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:53,340
Brad Bellick
Federal Bureau of Investigations.

396
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,015
Brad Bellick, FBI.

397
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,025
Special Agent Brad Bellick, FBI.

398
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:03,135
Hi, there,
I'm Brad Bellick with the FBI.

399
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:05,789
I'm an agent with the FBI, Brad Bellick.

400
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,470
Brad Bellick. I'm with the Bureau.

401
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,975
Brad Bellick. I'm with the Bureau.

402
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,212
I already talked to the cops,
told them all I had to say.

403
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:20,166
Yeah, well, I'm no local hayseed cop.

404
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,191
I'm federal.

405
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,199
And you're not going
to get away with lying to me.

406
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,615
I didn't lie to nobody.

407
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:26,714
Really?

408
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,344
"He was just some homeless guy,
hangs around Hancock Square,"

409
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:32,340
"hitting up college kids for change."

410
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,599
"He's down there all the time."

411
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,912
if he's not there,
I don't know where to find him."

412
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:37,299
That's your statement, right?

413
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,580
- Pretty much.
- Right. See,

414
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:40,600
the problem is
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik

415
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:43,639
is a paranoid,
who suffers from fear of crowds,

416
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,354
who's terrified of strangers.

417
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:47,398
If he's anywhere,
he's in the middle of nowhere,

418
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,242
keeping to himself, being a weirdo.

419
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:51,499
- And?
- And if you want to get tough...

420
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,100
how about I arrest you right now

421
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:55,099
for hindering a federal investigation?

422
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,156
Who they going to believe?

423
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:57,800
An agent with 15 years on the force

424
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:59,682
and three Presidential Citations

425
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,314
or a piece of White trash
with a juvie record?

426
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:07,975
I didn't ask him to do it,
but in case you haven't noticed,

427
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:09,100
I ain't exactly broken up

428
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,545
over my stepdad's death.

429
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:13,099
Why can't you just leave
this Patoshik guy alone?

430
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Where is he?

431
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:18,000
Or do you want to get locked up...
right now?

432
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,066
- Yeah.
- I got a lead on Patoshik.

433
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,091
<i>Where?</i>

434
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,601
I'm on my way.

435
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:33,269
<i>Keep him there.</i>

436
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Alone.

437
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,157
Any information on Scofield and Burrows,

438
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,083
I want to be notified immediately.

439
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:44,642
If that works out for you.

440
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:51,999
They're gonna have cops
waiting for us at the next station.

441
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,117
We need to jump then.

442
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,142
And do what?

443
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,092
Hide under a barrel?

444
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,638
Linc's right.

445
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,584
Okay, you just put those in there.

446
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,600
I'm so sorry about all this.

447
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:11,751
It's okay, sweet pea.

448
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,922
Here's everything right here, man.

449
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,814
- It's good.
- All right.

450
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:25,665
Everyone in the storage room. Now.

451
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,406
What?

452
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:31,091
Get back there until the cops show up.

453
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,301
No, I can't go back there.

454
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:35,141
- Come on!
- No!

455
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,205
Look, you kept a cool head
this whole time.

456
00:31:37,252 --> 00:31:38,492
Don't get yourself killed now.

457
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,000
You know what? Listen to me.

458
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,114
I'm a wanted man.

459
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,818
If the police show up here,

460
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:48,710
they'll take me back to prison.
And you know what? That's fine.

461
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,400
But my little girl right here?
She's sick.

462
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:53,315
And she's going to be left alone.

463
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,038
And I can't let that happen.

464
00:31:57,192 --> 00:32:00,400
So can you please let us go?

465
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:14,564
Go!

466
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,800
Come on, this way. Let's go.

467
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:20,300
All right, everyone in the back.

468
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,503
Move!

469
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:24,106
Not you.

470
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,625
You're coming with me.

471
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:27,800
Go on! Move!

472
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,100
Okay, I want you to stay right here,
okay?

473
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,008
Go on!

474
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:40,399
I think you should let her go, man.

475
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,599
Take off. Last chance.

476
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:43,900
You've got the money.

477
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,800
Burglary and assault.

478
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,961
Man, hey, that's change, man,
that's little time.

479
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,121
But this right here...

480
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,300
You will be in prison
for the rest of your life.

481
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,430
- Believe me on that.
- Unless you want

482
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:56,400
your daughter to see you die,

483
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:58,056
move.

484
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm trying to help you, man!

485
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,317
Come here!

486
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,500
Sweetie, stay right there.

487
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:39,409
Who did this?

488
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:45,267
I did.

489
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:57,240
Thank you.

490
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Don't move!

491
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,976
Run! Larry! Run! Hurry!

492
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,037
Hurry!

493
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:28,800
<i>Dino, it's Eric.</i>

494
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:30,462
<i>We've got four jumpers.</i>

495
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,000
<i>Three males and a female.</i>

496
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,400
<i>Call it and get us to the next station.</i>

497
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,927
<i>Do you hear me?
Get us to the next station.</i>

498
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,217
The men who pushed the roadblock
are jumping off the train,

499
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:46,624
near mile marker 54,
just south of the Tedwood bridge.

500
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,500
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot!

501
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Don't shoot!

502
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,817
Turn around!

503
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:38,210
I'm an employee of the train company.

504
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,902
Dino, it's Eric.

505
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:41,271
We've got four jumpers.

506
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,285
Three males and a female.
Call it and get us to the next station.

507
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:45,881
Let's go. Come on.

508
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,398
They told us to jump and run

509
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,500
and not to look back
or they'd shoot us.

510
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,100
We need to find a car.

511
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
I got Haywire trapped.

512
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,771
<i>Don't do anything.</i>

513
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,868
Just hold him until I get there.

514
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:51,800
No problem. I got this wingnut treed.

515
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,464
- Caroline.
<i>- Paul, where are you?</i>

516
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,700
- Did you send the police?
<i>-No, of course not.</i>

517
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,283
How did they know I was on that train?

518
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,599
<i>Paul, I have no idea.</i>

519
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,000
<i>I'll let the President know.
- I contact the President directly.</i>

520
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,300
<i>Are Burrows and Scofield with you?</i>

521
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,253
<i>I was expecting
to brief the President.</i>

522
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,581
<i>You report to me now.</i>

523
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,800
Where did we spend my 35th birthday?

524
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,900
<i>What?</i>

525
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,782
The restaurant.

526
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:49,622
Where was it? You remember.

527
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,799
Don't be ridiculous. I have to go.

528
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,820
Do not hang up.

529
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,157
I have to go.

530
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:55,599
<i>Just get Burrows and Scofield.</i>

531
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,600
Whoever this is...

532
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:01,800
tell Bill Kim that he just screwed up...

533
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
big-time.

534
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
What's all this?

535
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,600
Some whacko climbs up
to a grain elevator,

536
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
people want to watch.

537
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,787
God, you were supposed
to keep a handle on things.

538
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:46,223
Do you know what that means?

539
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:49,069
I got you Haywire.
What else do you want?

540
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
FBI. He's my chargee.

541
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,400
How you doing, Charles?

542
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:30,900
I don't want to go back to prison.

543
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,400
I don't blame you.

544
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,200
I want to go to Holland.

545
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,000
That's not what I expected to hear.

546
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
But you can't go there, son.

547
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:44,545
I just...

548
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,900
I just want to go... here.

549
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,404
See?

550
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,400
I'll tell you what.

551
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,700
You don't have to go to prison.

552
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,300
But you can't go to Holland, either.

553
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,635
- No, no!
- It's okay!

554
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:13,071
It's okay, it's okay.

555
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:15,326
You're in a tough spot.

556
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:17,801
You feel trapped,
you got no options, and...

557
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:20,100
caught in a situation
where you have no control.

558
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,865
I know how you feel.

559
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:24,614
I do.

560
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,900
It takes its toll on you,
and all you want to do is run.

561
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:34,124
But run where?

562
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:36,100
I just want to go.

563
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
There's a way out.

564
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,300
A way out?

565
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:48,737
Yeah.

566
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,200
Of this maze?

567
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,679
Yeah.

568
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:03,499
There are private humidors in the back.

569
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,552
Each member's name is on their box.

570
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,539
Any security?

571
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,500
A receptionist. That's it.

572
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,091
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

573
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:13,300
Give me the key. I'll do it.

574
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,600
Want to take a walk?

575
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,800
Yeah.

576
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,800
I know you killed your parents

577
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:22,942
because they hurt you.

578
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,773
And I know you killed
that guy yesterday

579
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:29,000
because he was hurting Sasha,
but what you did...

580
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,200
was wrong. You know that.

581
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:38,000
I just want to go.

582
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,800
You can.

583
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,000
I want to go <i>now.</i>

584
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:01,633
It's okay.

585
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,400
About before...

586
00:42:31,154 --> 00:42:32,165
Me, too.

587
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,100
Yeah.
