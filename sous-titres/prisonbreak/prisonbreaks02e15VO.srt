Hang up the phone now.

Break it up, convict!

17
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,306
No, no, this isn't fun-- what was fun

18
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:52,638
was when Caroline
and I would talk about you

19
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:55,334
and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,241
He proposed to her.

21

- Terrence! - I'm leaving!

22
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:03,156
Terrence, listen to me.

23
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,131
Just listen. So many people

24
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:07,597
have suffered because of this,
because of you.

25
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:10,390

you can tell the truth.

26

A dead body?
We got fingerprints everywhere.

46
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,059

someone's gonna pin a murder on you?

Stay there or I will drop him.

Brad Bellick,

00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:02,460
got locked up last night
for the murder of another guard.

This is Agent Mahone.

88
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:41,446

Can't keep driving.

We don't need him.

112
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:49,889
Actually, we do.

113
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,947
We still have assets.

114
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,592

Nuse!

119
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:47,102
You ain't no nurse.

120
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:48,470
You right about that.

121
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:50,606
Oh, that's a pretty shiner you got,
Captain.

122
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,898
Must make you think about all the times

123
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,499
you walked around here
in your fancy guard outfit,

124
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:56,732
turning a blind eye

125
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,562
to everything you saw that was wrong.

126
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:00,971
"Who me? Oh, I didn't see nothing."

127
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:04,342
How that blind eye feel now?

128
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:05,748
You son of a bitch.

129
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:06,750
You get used to it.

00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:12,938
- Over my dead body. - No.

133
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,789
A dead man can't feel a beat-down.

134
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,918
And you got a lot more coming your way.

135
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,379
Come on now, let's go.

136
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,435
It'll take the feds a while
to figure that out.

137
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,659
What time is it?

138
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,624
A little after 9:00.

139
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:03,038
- It's gonna be tight.
- 450 miles in six hours.

140
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,224
- What do you think?
- Got to move now.

141
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,380
Eyes front.

142
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:10,947
Hey, look at this.

143
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,264
It's perfect. You ready?

144
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,439
Yep.

145
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,178
Here, Larry, that's for you.

146
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:29,992
What about this? This is too small.

147
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,978
Why didn't it float?

148
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,617
Why didn't it...?

149
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:35,783
I need more wood.

150
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:37,581
Wood floats.

151
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:39,399
This will work.

152
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:44,023
Hey, man.

153
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:54,810
We were just wondering
if you could buy us some beer.

154
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,587
Yeah, sure.

155
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,527
Can I get some food for my dog, too?

156
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:09,355
Do whatever thing you got to do, man.
You can even keep a beer for yourself.

157
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,666
My dad used to drink.

158
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,795
You're going to want to see this.

159
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,647
We've shut down every freeway so far
in central Montana, no sign of them.

160
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:47,559
Go wider: Get troopers on and 90 and 94,
all the way through Wyoming,

161
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,925
and call Whitefish. Have him lock down
the Canadian border at 15.

<i>My name is Lincoln Burrows,

<i>He killed himself out of fear.</i>

169

<i>Fear of the people

<i>for the past three years.</i>

00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,836
<i>The same people
who want my brother dead.</i>

172
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,912
<i>They don't want you to know
who they are, but know this:</i>

173
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:34,081
<i>They've stolen billions of dollars</i>

174
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:36,303
<i>and murdered dozens of innocent people.</i>

175

<i>And yet they plaster
our faces on the news,</i>

176
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:40,319
<i>and tell you to be afraid.</i>

177
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,661
<i>They are a group of multinationals

178
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,291
<i>Together, they're known as The Company.</i>

179
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:49,267
<i>They are working with the highest levels
of government,</i>

180
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,789
<i>including
the President of the United States.</i>

181
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:56,374
Damage control immediately,
before this hits page one.

182
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,777
- It's already airing, sir.
- Start a wildfire in Florida!

183
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:03,158
Find a lost storage unit full of Arabs!
I do not care!

184
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,919
As long as it's not about
Lincoln Burrows!

185
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:10,039
<i>And they operate with impunity
under the cover of the Secret Service,</i>

186
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:13,288
<i>the very people meant
to protect and serve.</i>

187
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:01,015
<i>Much blame has been placed
on another innocent person:<i>

188
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,275
<i>Dr. Sara Tancredi.</i>

189
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:05,967
Do we know how long the videotape lasts?

190
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,667
26 minutes, beginning to end.

191
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,246
It's all online.

192
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:12,130
<i>I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

193
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:14,663
<i>I can only hope that, by now,</i>

194
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:16,734
<i>you've found your safe haven.</i>

195
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:20,582
Start a transcript. I need every word.

196
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,875
<i>...your commitment to help
others, and I put you in a place</i>

197
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,345
<i>that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

198
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:28,380
<i>I wish I could do things differently...</i>

199
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,051
Call Montana, have them send an agent
to talk to the cameraman.

200
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,871
I want to know what he saw,
what he heard,

201
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:36,001
what they were wearing--
anything he can give us.

202
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,027
<i>One man, Special Agent Alexander Mahone,</i>

203
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,610
<i>is responsible for multiple deaths.</i>

204
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,737
<i>He murdered not only John Abruzzi
and David Apolskis,</i>

205
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:48,670
<i>but also the last fugitive
he was assigned to chase:</i>

206
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,912
<i>a man named Oscar Shales.</i>

207
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:53,511
<i>A man who escaped from prison
two years ago,</i>

208
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,150
<i>who remains
one of this country's most wanted</i>

209
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:59,013
<i>despite the fact he will never be found.</i>

210
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:01,746
- The guy's nuts.
- <i>He'll do whatever it takes</i>

211
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,955
<i>to make the deaths look official
like they happened in the line of duty--</i>

212
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:06,264
<i>Disappearances...</i>

213
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:12,358
- Hey, thank you.
- Sure. Here you go.

214
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:19,545
What's the wood for?

215
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,140
I'm building a raft.

216
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:26,199
I need more wood if I'm going
to make it to Holland.

217
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:28,911
- Holland?
- Yeah.

218
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:31,350
Want to see it?

219
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:32,826
The raft?

220
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:38,934
You're going to try to get
from here to Holland in that?

221
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,043
Yeah, good luck, Gilligan.

222
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,669
I'm going to take a leak.

223
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,163
How are you going to
know where you're going?

224
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:51,004
Do you have, like
a map or anything?

225
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:55,356
Yeah. I do.

226
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,901
It's-it's right...

227
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:00,946
Oh, it's right here.

228
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:08,663
That's your map?

229
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:14,527
Well, I really hope you make it.

230
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:18,846
You know, every morning, I wake up and

231
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,939
wonder what it would be like
to just disappear.

232
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:26,042
And you're just going to do it.

233
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:28,664
I think it's great.

234
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,708
What happened to your arm?

235
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,548
My dad drinks, too.

236
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:02,415
What's going on?

237
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:04,901
- Oh, nothing.
- No, no. No, no, don't...

238
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:06,344
- I-I...
- Let me go !

239
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,890
- I just want to fix it.
- Let me go.

240
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,323
- No, I just want...
- Stop!

241
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:13,993
Matt, will you
take me home, please?

242
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:15,449
No, I...

243
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:19,043
Freak.

244
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,267
All right, now, Brad,
how we doing?

245
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:50,866
I could be better.

246
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,427
Yeah, that's a nasty contusion, but

247
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:55,705
it should go down in about 24 hours.

248
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:59,875
I got your paperwork here
for your transfer back to Gen Pop.

249
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:01,398
Already?

250
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,914
Move 'em in, move 'em out,
you know the policy.

251
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,012
Katie...

252
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,540
You look nice today.

253
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,116
You worked here over ten years, right?

254
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:18,564
Something like that.

255
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,168
That's a long time we've been friends.

256
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:26,325
Brad, if you think I can pull
some strings to keep you

257
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:28,395
out of Gen Pop, I can't do that.

258
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:30,880
Please. Please,
You can't send me back there.

259
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,790
Do you want that responsibility,
knowing what they'll do to me?

260
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:36,183
Just listen, please. One more night.

261
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,252
Just let me stay here tonight.

262
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,989
I know you can do that.

263
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:43,624
And when you go home,

264
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:46,897
just leave that door open for me.

265
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,292
They hung a sheet
behind their heads on the wall.

266
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,443
One of them-- the guy with the gun--
he found it

267
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:03,036
while Burrows and Scofield
were talking

268
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,346
about how far they had to go.

269
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,610
Scofield said something
about 450 miles in six hours.

270
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:14,163
450 miles to where?

271
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,309
I don't know.

272
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:21,630
450 miles in six hours.

273
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,318
Any point on this circle

274
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,210
could be their final destination.

275
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,289
75 miles per hour,

276
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,142
stopping for gas.

277
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:31,709
- It's doable.
- Yeah?

278
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:33,184
Where are they?

279
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:36,926
I'm not sure.

280
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,918
I still need more time.

281
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,212
This can't happen fast enough,
Mr. Mahone.

282
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,310
They've already done irreparable damage.

283
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,857
Scofield made the video
in a storage facility

284
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,861
somewhere between Great Falls and Helena

285
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,568
<i>not long after sunrise.</i>

286
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,452
<i>From there, the witness said</i>

287
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:54,419
they had 450 miles
to get where they were going.

288
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,536
<i>There's Seattle,</i>

289
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,675
Portland, Salt Lake, Denver...

290
00:20:58,447 --> 00:20:59,482
Denver?

291
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:00,942
Yes. What?

292
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,691
The president is speaking there
this afternoon.

293
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:05,686
3:00.

294
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:08,410
Six hours from when
they made the video.

295
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:11,306
They're going after the president.

296
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,986
<i>A tape reported to be made
by escaped convicts</i>

297
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,766
<i>Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield</i>

298
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:22,273
<i>was immediately dismissed
by the Justice Department,</i>

299
00:21:22,274 --> 00:21:25,323
<i>as entirely baseless, which
brings us back to the story</i>

300
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,755
<i>we'll be continuing
to follow throughout the day.</i>

301
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,700
<i>The terror threat
has been raised to Orange</i>

302
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:32,438
<i>as a storage unit rented
by several Arab Americans</i>

303
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,890
<i>was suddenly seized.</i>

304
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,787
They buried it, dumped it off
the front page and buried it.

305
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:39,276
- It's what they do.
- They can spin it all they want,

306
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,377
it's out there now.

307
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,019
Give it time. The tape is gonna work.

308
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:46,012
This is a Hail Mary, man.
If we don't get to her...

309
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,268
Getting to her is the easy part.

310
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,986
It's what we do after
that's the problem.

311
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,644
Which is why this has to happen quickly.

312
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:53,044
Once anyone knows we have her,
the curtain comes down.

313
00:21:56,902 --> 00:21:59,335
I'll tell the White House
to cancel the President's speech.

314
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:00,673
No. If they change her itinerary,

315
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,903
they'll know something's up,

316
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,685
and they're gonna go
right back into hiding.

317
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,848
We've found them before,
we can find them again...

318
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:07,720
These are not pets, Agent Wheeler.

319
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:11,754
Yeah, thanks, I'm pretty clear on that,

320
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:14,141
but if you're gonna use
the Commander in Chief as bait,

321
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:15,301
it's certainly not gonna...

322
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,298
You have a problem
with the way that I do things?

323
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:21,366
Yeah.

324
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:24,847
And I'm not the only one.

325
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,124
Is that right?

326
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:31,964
Internal Affairs has asked me
to run all your moves through them

327
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:32,977
from here on out.

328
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:47,733
Then get a pen,

329
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:50,808
and make sure you get this
word-for-word.

330
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,494
the President's day does not change.

331
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:56,753
The only lead we have is that we know

332
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:57,907
where these men
are headed.

333
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,825
So we're gonna keep quiet about this

334
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:02,407
and let 'em come.

335
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,253
Now, get out of my office.

336
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:14,231
They're two of the most
recognizable faces in America.

337
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,514
How do they think they're gonna get
anywhere near the President?

338
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,272
Because it's not just
the two of them anymore.

339
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:22,727
I'm gonna go take a closer look
at that video.

340
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,662
If I may, sir, the President...

341
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:31,448
Are you certain we should keep her
in the dark on this?

342
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:35,629
Because there is a scenario where...

343
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,779
she could be useful.

344
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:45,679
It is... her ass on the line, sir.

345
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,651
And I think we're all pretty clear
she's been known

346
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:51,132
to get her hands dirty
when that line gets too close.

347
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:55,312
We should let her know

348
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,821
just how close it is.

349
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:19,925
Finished?

350
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:13,596
They did a good job masking the room.

351
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:15,437
No reflections, no flares.

352
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,123
Audio markers-- church bells,

353
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,667
construction, traffic, anything?

354
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:21,195
The room tone tells us
they were in a large space.

355
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:23,175
About 100,000 cubic feet.

356
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,638
So the kid with the camera,
his story matches up?

357
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:28,056
We clocked the quality of light
with the time of day

358
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:29,972
and it pretty much fits
his wheres and whens.

359
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:31,122
All right. Content!

360
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:34,495
The usual tells. Eyes, hands, feet.

361
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,227
Burrows, we were able to baseline him

362
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:37,618
off the footage from his trial,

363
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:39,227
so we got even more clarity there.

364
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:41,929
<i>I escaped from Fox River Penitentiary</i>

365
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:44,765
<i>because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.</i>

366
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:47,393
<i>I did not murder Terrence Steadman.</i>

367
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:48,570
Okay, there.

368
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:50,430
The eyes.

369
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:53,554
- See it?
- Yes, slight shift to the left then up.

370
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:56,176
Yeah, blink rate's up here
versus the pattern.

371
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:59,645
<i>He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel</i>

372
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,696
<i>30 miles outside from this home
in Blackfoot, Montana.</i>

373
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:05,612
He's lying.

374
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:07,181
Seems so.

375
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:12,719
Okay. Here, Burrows,

376
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:13,896
arms folded.

377
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,214
He's protecting himself.

378
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:16,993
<i>They'll do whatever it takes...</i>

379
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,608
Not a lot of confidence in his words.

380
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:20,489
<i>...like they happen in the line of duty.<i>

381
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,388
Okay, that means something other
than what he's saying.

382
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,365
<i>Like our father, Aldo Burrows...</i>

383
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:27,706
Posture, shoulders in, for emphasis.

384
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:30,101
Really wants your attention here.

385
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:31,434
<i>Our attorney, Veronica Donovan...</i>

386
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,856
<i>- I was on the phone...</i>
- There.

387
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:35,736
<i>- ...shot her like an animal.</i>
- Adam's apple.

388
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:36,846
Zoom in, zoom in.

389
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:39,138
See? He's swallowing. Throat's dry.

390
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,077
- That's a lie.
- Yeah.

391
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,151
His behavior is textbook.

392
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,433
If there's anything in here about
what they plan on doing in Denver,

393
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:47,549
they're gonna tell us.

394
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,511
If you say it that way,
it plays too earnest.

395
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:55,317
'Course it will. It's the truth.

396
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,672
Okay, but the truth sends them home
to the wife and kids.

397
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:59,077
Lies will keep them busy.

398
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,311
I'm not telling a lie
to the whole country.

399
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,281
It's our one chance to say it out...

400
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,798
Yeah, say whatever the hell you want.

401
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,741
Tell them you're the Green Lantern,

402
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,644
but I know how they break down
these tapes.

403
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:09,880
I've done it.

404
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:12,314
Every detail matters.

405
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:14,521
Bin Laden crosses his legs
right over left

406
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:16,984
tells us something completely different
than left over right.

407
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:18,152
It's not the same message.

408
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,630
To them, it is.

409
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,020
If you want this plan to work,

410
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:23,555
whatever you say with your mouths,

411
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:25,594
you need to be saying
something different

412
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:27,004
with your bodies and your eyes.

413
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:29,033
Slightly up and to the left.

414
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,201
Yes.

415
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:34,996
<i>Much blame has been placed</i>

416
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:36,996
<i>on another innocent person...</i>

417
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:39,725
President's motorcade is rolling in.
So far no sign of the brothers.

418
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,720
Right there!
What's Scofield doing with his hand?

419
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:45,583
We've been throwing them
a bunch of fast balls.

420
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,176
What do you say we mix it up a little?

421
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:48,259
Like what?

422
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:51,088
We think it's Morse code.

423
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:52,315
For what?

424
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:56,203
Right now, we've got a phrase:
"The water is warm."

425
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:57,943
Any idea what that might mean?

426
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,709
What the hell does that mean?

427
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:01,170
Nothing.

428
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:03,592
It'll take the Feds a while
to figure that out.

429
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:05,675
We have teams checking
the surrounding counties

430
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,735
for the water temps.

431
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,794
It might be a message to an accomplice.

432
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,062
The Platte river
runs through the city.

433
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:16,127
- They may be trying...
- It doesn't mean anything!

434
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:17,938
He's traveling with
an ex-Secret Service guy.

435
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,802
I guess they're spoon-feeding us
every lead they want us to follow.

436
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,773
So all this is just a distraction
while they go after the President?

437
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:25,726
They had to know the tape
would be discredited.

438
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,909
They had to know that we'd talk
to the cameraman.

439
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:29,940
There's something else going on, here.

440
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:32,784
<i>...on another innocent person,</i>

441
00:29:33,826 --> 00:29:35,164
<i>Dr. Sara Tancredi.</i>

442
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:38,451
<i>Sara, if you're listening,</i>

443
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,368
<i>I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

444
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,752
<i>I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.</i>

445
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,674
<i>I took advantage of you,</i>

446
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,756
<i>of your commitment to help others</i>

447
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,721
<i>and put your in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

448
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,118
<i>Sara, if you're listening,</i>

449
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:57,085
<i>I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

450
00:29:57,531 --> 00:29:59,910
<i>I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.</i>

451
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,528
<i>I took advantage of you,</i>

452
00:30:02,795 --> 00:30:04,416
<i>of your commitment to help others,</i>

453
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:07,821
<i>and put your in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

454
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:10,160
<i>...of your commitment to help others,</i>

455
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:13,261
<i>and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

456
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,959
<i>I've considered many ways to apologize,</i>

457
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:17,691
<i>but I must arrive at one.</i>

458
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,818
There's more of the same here.

459
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,711
Body language just tells that...

460
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,001
It doesn't look like he means it at all.

461
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:26,957
I don't care what it looks like.
Play it again.

462
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,797
- I don't see...
- Play it again!

463
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,918
<i>I only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.</i>

464
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:36,573
<i>I took advantage of you,</i>

465
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:38,633
<i>of your commitment to help others,</i>

466
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:41,377
<i>and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

467
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:42,502
His voice, would you say

468
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:44,414
he sounds sincere
when he's talking to her

469
00:30:44,415 --> 00:30:46,579
as opposed to when he's talking
about their crimes?

470
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,769
- I guess you could say that.
- I did say that.

471
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:49,844
Would you say that?

472
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:52,640
<i>I wish I could do this differently
but it's too late for that now.</i>

473
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:53,832
Yeah.

474
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,892
<i>It's too late for you and for others.</i>

475
00:30:56,214 --> 00:30:57,988
<i>People murdered
by government operatives...</i>

476
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:00,967
This isn't about Steadman,
and it's not about their innocence.

477
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,454
- What do you mean?
- They're not

478
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:04,625
after the President.
They're going after the doctor.

479
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:06,716
I want everything we've got
on Sara Tancredi!

480
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:08,377
Friends, families, pen-pals.

481
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,567
If anybody so much as wrote her
a thank-you note,

482
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:12,471
I want to know where the hell they are!
Now!

483
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:07,973
Yes.

484
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:45,991
Joe...

485
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:10,757
Sara Tancredi.

486
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,064
Dad dead, mom dead.

487
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:15,732
E-mail account shows
a minimal list of contacts

488
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:17,233
with very little activity.

489
00:33:18,072 --> 00:33:20,343
Credit cards used mostly for groceries,

490
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:22,797
sporadic clothing shopping and...

491
00:33:22,922 --> 00:33:24,811
the purchase of single movie tickets.

492
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:27,405
And ob-gyn records tell us
she's had very little in the way

493
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,318
of sexual relationships recently.

494
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:33,421
To tell you the truth, I would say
the bulk of her life was her work.

495
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:52,566
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?

496
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,678
Apparently, we took out a janitor.

497
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:16,073
When it all comes down,
all of this will get cleared up.

498
00:34:16,074 --> 00:34:18,159
Well, it ain't coming down
if we don't get Sara.

499
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,194
She'll be here.

500
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:22,456
I want to speak to my brother.

501
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:30,481
We got to start thinking about
what to do if she doesn't show.

502
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,586
Or if she does.

503
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,636
What if the only reason
this guy's helping us

504
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,292
is to get whatever information Sara has?

505
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,311
What if this is just one giant setup?

506
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:54,771
Well, good night.

507
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:13,391
It's about time you come home.

508
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,875
Been out with that Feytek boy again?

509
00:35:19,014 --> 00:35:20,112
Sasha.

510
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,430
You may look like me...

511
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:26,671
but you take after your mom
when it comes to boys,

512
00:35:26,672 --> 00:35:27,693
now, don't you?

513
00:35:28,368 --> 00:35:30,574
Hopefully, with a little better taste.

514
00:35:32,651 --> 00:35:35,630
Damn it, girl, you are gonna
show me some respect.

515
00:35:51,338 --> 00:35:52,833
I know Sara didn't have many friends.

516
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,166
She's sort of a loner.

517
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:55,954
But you were her friend.

518
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:58,128
I like to think so, yes.

519
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:00,327
And you have no idea where she is now?

520
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:06,143
This is a transcript
of the Scofield-Burrows videotape.

521
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:09,342
I highlighted the part
where he talks directly to Sara.

522
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,635
Mean anything to you?

523
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:17,060
You have no idea
where she might meet him, if...

524
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:18,151
that's his plan?

525
00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:25,540
Is Brad Bellick still here
in the infirmary?

526
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:26,657
Yeah. Why?

527
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,361
You must be loving this.

528
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:33,149
I didn't drive all this way to gloat.

529
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,639
Well, then what the hell
you come here for?

530
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:42,336
First, I really...
got to tip my cap to you.

531
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:45,601
You've managed to draw a bead on the
convicts more often than my own staff.

532
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:47,312
Well, thanks for the "attaboy," but...

533
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:49,116
as you can see, the correctional system

534
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:50,826
doesn't share your gratitude.

535
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:54,964
I won't take much of your time,
but I do have a few questions.

536
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,606
- About...?
- Sara Tancredi.

537
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:58,067
She listed you as a reference

538
00:36:58,068 --> 00:36:59,737
on her job application to work here.

539
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:00,768
You know her well?

540
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:06,775
I'd know her a lot better
if you can get my ass moved to Ad Seg.

541
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:12,129
I have no influence with the D.O.C.--
you know that.

542
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:14,510
If you want my help, you do.

543
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,952
I'll talk to the warden
and see what I can do

544
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:20,853
right after you give me some answers.

545
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:24,302
Scofield likes to communicate
with Sara via coded message.

546
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,132
Do you recognize anything here?

547
00:37:27,805 --> 00:37:30,698
- Anything that he's trying to tell her?

548
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:32,956
I mean, he's saying he's sorry.

549
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,442
Not that that's gonna do any good
with Dr. Cold Shoulder.

550
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:38,952
But...

551
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,332
What?

552
00:37:43,817 --> 00:37:44,859
Ad Seg.

553
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,279
Yeah.

554
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,631
All right, you see here,

555
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:57,983
where it says this stuff
about "another chance."

556
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,073
"Safe haven."

557
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,075
That's out of the big book.

558
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:02,109
What big book?

559
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:03,622
Alcoholics Anonymous.

560
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:04,803
Sara's in recovery.

561
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:07,812
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.
- Those are the names

562
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:11,136
of some of the chapters
in the book they use in AA.

563
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:13,604
Do you have a copy
of the Alcoholics Anonymous book?

564
00:38:16,616 --> 00:38:18,125
<i>Sara, if you're listening,</i>

565
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,455
<i>I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

566
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:29,468
<i>I can only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.</i>

567
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:36,736
<i>I took advantage of you,
your commitment to help others</i>

568
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:42,141
<i>and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

569
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,859
<i>I've considered many ways to apologize,</i>

570
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,652
<i>but I must arrive at one.</i>

571
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,469
- It's getting late.
- I know.

572
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:56,806
She's not here.

573
00:38:57,741 --> 00:38:58,765
I know that, too.

574
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,814
There is a chance
she didn't get the message.

575
00:39:02,815 --> 00:39:04,698
Or maybe she's just sick of all this.

576
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:07,030
The girl bailed on you back in Gila.

577
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:11,028
What makes you think she's gonna
come running back now?

578
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:15,601
The same thing
that's been keeping us
going for the last three months: faith.

579
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:19,105
Yeah, well...
reality's kicking faith's ass, man.

580
00:39:20,153 --> 00:39:21,668
- Look...
-  Wait, wait.

581
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:24,087
Wait? Man, we can't wait anymore.

582
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:25,100
Listen, listen.

583
00:39:26,553 --> 00:39:28,166
<i>Once again, Michael Crane,</i>

584
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,055
<i>please report to the front desk.</i>

585
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:31,728
<i>You have a telephone call.</i>

586
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:35,438
Yeah. Sara Tancredi.

587
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:38,850
That's right.
She might be with them now.

588
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,364
Just call the local police in Akron

589
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,191
and tell them to get everyone they have

590
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:44,054
over to St. Thomas Hospital now.

591
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:51,137
Michael Crane.
I think you have a call for me.

592
00:39:56,342 --> 00:39:57,428
Thank you.

593
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:01,569
This is Mr. Crane.

594
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:04,966
It sounded better than "Origami".

595
00:40:05,274 --> 00:40:08,336
Even if you got the message,
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

596
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:09,782
I couldn't get to you in time.

597
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:12,128
This is the only thing I could think of.

598
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,654
I swore I'd leave you alone,
but I had to contact you.

599
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:20,126
Because I have something?

600
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,530
How'd you know?

601
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:25,578
<i>Michael, back in Gila
I was coming back to you.</i>

602
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:30,122
Somebody... grabbed me, and they...

603
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,874
they told me that my father
had given me something.

604
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:35,128
Did someone hurt you?

605
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:37,502
<i>I got away.</i>

606
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:44,161
Michael, I want for this to be over.

607
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:48,276
That makes two of us.

608
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,316
Do you think that's possible?

609
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:55,143
With your help, yes.

610
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:58,603
It's just a question of looking at
whatever it is your father gave you.

611
00:40:58,709 --> 00:40:59,694
It's just...

612
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:03,377
It's just a key.

613
00:41:04,054 --> 00:41:05,558
Well, we'll figure it out.

614
00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:07,698
Together.

615
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,106
I like the sound of that.

616
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,148
Me, too.

617
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,033
<i>Hello, Paul.</i>

618
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:41,634
Madam President, it's been a while.

619
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:43,042
<i>I know.</i>

620
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:45,053
<i>I'm calling to apologize.</i>

621
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:48,063
Okay.

622
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:50,807
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

623
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:54,146
<i>It all just got away from me,
and I ended up hurting</i>

624
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,053
<i>the one person
who's always been at my side.</i>

625
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,687
<i>I want you to come home, Paul.</i>

626
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:01,370
<i>We can fix this together.</i>

627
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:04,883
<i>But not with those brothers
running around the country</i>

628
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,807
<i>tearing down the very office
you helped me build.</i>

629
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:10,666
Caroline...

630
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,445
<i>I want to make it up to you.</i>

631
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:16,153
<i>Please, bring them in, Paul,
and everything can go back</i>

632
00:42:16,154 --> 00:42:17,215
<i>to the way it was.</i>

633
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:23,862
<i>I have to go now.</i>

634
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:24,902
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

635
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,533
Did you talk to Sara?

636
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:38,894
In a few days, this should all be over,

637
00:42:38,895 --> 00:42:40,148
one way or the other.

638
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,147
Absolutely.
