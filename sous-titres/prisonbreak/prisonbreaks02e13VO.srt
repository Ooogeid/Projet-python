00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:02,425
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:03,722
We're staying.

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,785
Give 'em hell.

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:14,772
Bill, don't do this.

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,592
<i>I've dedicated my life to this country.
To President Reynolds.</i>

6
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:20,244
Every photo, every file,
get rid of it all.

7
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:21,647
<i>Bill, don't do this.</i>

8
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:23,927
You left a message for Mr. Geary.

9
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:25,642
<i>I'm going to gut you, bow to stern.</i>

10
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,311
I did not kill Roy Geary.

11
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:28,474
Bagwell set me up!

12
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:29,424
You are under arrest

13
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:31,534
for the first degree murder
of Roy William Geary.

14
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:34,035
My therapist said
that I need to confront you

15
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,351
to let you know how betrayed I feel.

16
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,662
This is the Tribune Police!

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,915
Look, as long as you do your job,
we forget about Shales.

18
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:46,394
And then you can go back to Colorado
and visit your son and family.

19
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:50,360
Don't you ever mention his name again.

20
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,073
What about your friend back there?

21
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:53,697
If we're going to go down...

22
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,127
might as well go down swinging.

23
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:14,159
Almost made it.

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,247
<i>- Is that you?</i>
- Get up.

25
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,580
Turn around.

26
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:27,642
Turn around!

27
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:29,523
If you're going to murder us, Alex,

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,618
you'll have to look us
in the eyes while you do it.

29
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,749
- Shut up.
- You want me, you got me.

30
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:35,188
Let my brother go!

31
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,480
I don't want either of you.

32
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,238
I just want my life back!

33
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,793
You're going to kill two innocent men
to get it, huh?

34
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:41,794
Absolutely.

35
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:44,665
<i>This is the United States Border Patrol.</i>

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,943
<i>Drop the weapon
and remain where you are.</i>

37
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,502
<i>Drop your weapon.</i>

38
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:51,482
United States Border Patrol.

39
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:53,138
Drop your weapon!

40
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:59,157
I'm FBI. These men are in my custody.

41
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:00,615
I don't care who you are.

42
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:03,504
Until we verify,
you will drop your weapon

43
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:04,860
or we will drop you.

44
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,416
Your choice.

45
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:20,988
Move in!

46
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,512
Hands on your head, now!

47
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:27,492
Don't move!

48
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:35,733
You got anything to drink?

49
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,642
Check the back.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,371
<i>Unknown rider, unknown rider,
this is DEA on guard.</i>

51
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,502
<i>Bring up frequency 1145.</i>

52
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,546
What do you mean "Oh oh"?

53
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,366
Border Patrol's on our ass, man.

54
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:54,094
How long till we get to Mexico?

55
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,841
We're already in Mexico, Papi.

56
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,467
I thought they couldn't follow us

57
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:59,837
- once we crossed the border.
- Not since 9/11, hombre.

58
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:02,555
<i>I repeat: unknown rider,
unknown...</i>

59
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,070
What are we going to do?

60
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,030
Pull the chord, and pray.

61
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:08,863
Oh, hell no!

62
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:12,190
Look, we try and land the plane,
we're pinched for sure.

63
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:13,674
And if we jump?

64
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,251
We're in the middle of the desert.

65
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:19,805
Patrol have a hard time
trying to find us once we land.

66
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:20,968
If we land.

67
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:22,840
Oh, you're going to land.

68
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,576
It's just a matter of how hard.

69
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,780
Good luck, amigo.

70
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:46,746
<i>We're receiving reports
that escaped convicts</i>

71
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,083
<i>Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield</i>

72
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:52,687

73
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,991
<i>Federal Agent Alex Mahone

74
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:57,021

<i>took the men into custody

76
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,997
<i>Now, not a lot of information
available at this time,</i>

77
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,684
<i>but we do know the brothers
were apprehended without incident</i>

78
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:08,122
<i>while attempting to leave the country
through the deserts of New Mexico,</i>

79
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,865

<i>as only Benjamin Miles Franklin,</i>

85
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:25,029
<i>Fernando Sucre, Charles Patoshik
and Theodore Bagwell remain at large.</i>

86
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,080
<i>- Officials say that...</i>
- Sir.

87
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:28,247
He just heard.

88
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,627
And he'd like to see you.

90
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,777
<i>... known, are now down to four,</i>

91
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,832

93
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:45,857
Godspeed, gentlemen.

94
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,105
'Scuse me, Sarge.

95
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:14,106
I... was wondering if you could...
help a brother out.

96
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,152
With what?

97
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:20,004
I only recently returned
from delivering democracy to the desert

98
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,600
and uh, I was wondering if

99
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,848
you could tell me how a guy goes about

100
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,290
getting a hold
of one of those prosthetic jobbies.

101
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,637
What, they make you whole
before they shipped you back?

102
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,681
Well, let's just say
the doctor made the bed.

103
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:34,760
He just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

104
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:39,587
Best thing for you to do
is go on down there to VA. Get in line.

105
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
That simple?

106
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,587
Till they send you the bill
and you got to figure out how to pay.

107
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,347
Those bastards in Washington send us off

108
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,837
to fight for them;
not a damn one of 'em fights for us.

109
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:52,949
And that is a crime.

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,098
But luckily for me...

111
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,302
money is not the issue.

112
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,025
Is that right?

113
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:04,789
Any particular, uh,
forms I might need in order to qualify?

114
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,775
You know what,

115
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:08,296
Mr. Don't-ask-don't-tell?

116
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:11,650
You figured out
how to dye that hair of yours

117
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:13,639
up like a nancy all by yourself,

118
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,430
you sure as hell
can figure out how to get

119
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:18,059
a prosthetic for that stump
of yours by yourself.

120
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:26,237
Yeah, I think I got
a pretty good idea where to start.

121
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:45,839
I'm here with Ed Pavelka, the new warden
of Fox River Penitentiary,

122
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,964
where Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield

123
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,512
are scheduled to be returned
to sometime tomorrow.

124
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,257
Now, Warden, the escape happened a mere

125
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:55,383
two days before Burrows
was scheduled to be put to death.

126
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:58,887
He's already been granted one day ;
do you anticipate any further?

127
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,387
Lincoln Burrows is a convicted murder.

128
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,838
His escape has endangered the lives
of civilians across this country.

129
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,403
He is not a celebrity.

130
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:09,150
He is not a martyr.

131
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:13,150
I can assure you
that whatever leniency was afforded him

132
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,900
and the other prisoners
under the old regime at Fox River

133
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,456
will no longer be tolerated.

134
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,677
The only thing
that Mr. Burrows can expect

135
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:24,539
is what a jury of his peers demanded:
a speedy execution.

136
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,057
And Michael Scofield?

137
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:27,713
With his escape,

138
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:29,777
the aiding and abetting charges,

139
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:32,111
the felonies he's racked up
along the way,

140
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,213
on top of his original sentence,

141
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:38,158
I'd say Mr. Scofield will be spending
the rest of his life behind bars.

142
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:39,215
Thank you.

00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:16,588
Who's got Mahone?

146
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:21,775
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

147
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:22,776
What do you got?

148
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,502
A call from the Illinois DOC.

149
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:26,797
They're sending a huge contingent
down there to collect

150
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,436
<i>Burrows and Scofield, take them back
to Fox River personally.</i>

151
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,467
<i>Remind them this is</i>

152
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:32,313
a federal case
and we'll handle the transport.

153
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,889
I did. But it's an election year,
collar this big,

154
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,687
everybody wants a piece.
The warden called

155
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:39,822
<i>in a favor to the Bureau Chief;
he okayed it, so here we are.</i>

156
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,919
<i>Should be there in about an hour.</i>

157
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,927
I want to be placed
in the prisoner transport vehicle.

158
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,086
What for?

159
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,354
Just get it done.

160
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,000
Sir, these were the big fish.

161
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:51,864
And you brought 'em in.

162
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:53,864
You should feel good about that.

163
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:01,895
We are at least together.

164
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,284
Yes, there is that.

165
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,229
What are you thinking?

166
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,973
I'm thinking about the old man.

167
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,486
What he tried to do, you know.

168
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:20,241
Tough to go down swinging
when you're locked in a box.

169
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,041
This isn't over yet.

170
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,928
We're entitled to a phone call.

171
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,423
We make that one call to Sara
and if she has the information

172
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,571
dad said she has,

173
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:31,302
we can get you exonerated
before this whole thing goes down.

174
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,456
We're entitled to a phone call.

175
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:41,747
You're entitled to precisely squat
until you're officially in custody.

176
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:44,795
And that won't happen
until you're back in Fox River.

177
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:45,796
So sit tight.

178
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:52,796
It's not over yet.

179
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:54,297
Not yet.

180
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:59,004
A lot of ground to cover
between here and Illinois.

181
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:03,318
I mean, what are the chances
we even make it back to Fox River alive?

182
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:10,629
<i>Saw you on the news, Alex.</i>

183
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:12,483
- Did you?
<i>- The brothers too.</i>

184
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:15,087
They were a little more...

185
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,524
breathing than I had hoped.

186
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:20,303
Yeah, well, Border Patrol showed up.
Nothing I could do.

187
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:21,632
<i>Really?</i>

188
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:25,313
Burrows and Scofield, can you see them
from where you are?

189
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,214
Yeah.

190
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,363
<i>Then put a bullet in their heads.</i>

191
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,812
They're being watched.

192
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,339
<i>I don't care.</i>

193
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:34,694
<i>By armed guards.</i>

194
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,116
They make it back to Fox River,
it is over.

195
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,215
For all of us.

196
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:41,473
<i>There's not much more this country love
than a bad man with a good story.</i>

197
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,213
How much longer do you think it'll be

198
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,465
before someone puts
a microphone in front of them?

199
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:46,975
Are you listening?

200
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:48,588
Okay, with the security here,

201
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:51,028
what you're asking me to do
is tantamount to suicide.

202
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,650
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I wasn't asking anything.

203
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:56,671
That would imply you had a say
in the matter.

204
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,555
Pull this off and you're halfway home,
Alex.

205
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,673
You remember what home is like.
Don't you?

206
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:07,388
900 West End Avenue.

207
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,395
White fence. Red door.

208
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:11,398
Stay away from my family!

209
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,895
You got a little something on your...

210
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:14,727
No, I... here, let me.

211
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,131
- Pardon my forwardness, I was...
- It's okay. Thank you.

212
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:23,856
Normally I wouldn't intervene,
it's just...

213
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:26,529
yesterday when I got home from work,

214
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:30,368
I found what looked like
the Brazilian Rain Forest

215
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,353
lodged between my two front teeth.

216
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:34,651
And all I could think about

217
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:37,540
was the number of people
who must've seen and not...

218
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:40,495
not a damn one of them
had the decency to tell me.

219
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:43,612
Mild diastema.

220
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:45,654
Excuse me?

221
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,020
It's a slight gap between
your eight and nine.

222
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:52,631
Your two front teeth.

223
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:56,439
And that it sometimes can act
as a magnet for food like...

224
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:00,333
broccoli and tuna and sometimes rice.

225
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:02,216
Or relish.

226
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,230
All this and brains, too?

227
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,705
What are you, a dentist or...?

228
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:08,619
Me? No, hardly, no.

229
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:09,717
I could never.

230
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,090
My... ex-husband, he was...

231
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,091
A bastard?

232
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,719
That too.

233
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,498
Have you ever been to Italy, uh...?

234
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:29,465
Denise.

235
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,205
Denise, that's a lovely name.

236
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:39,885
You know, in Italy, they have wine
every day with lunch.

237
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:42,674
And what do we do in this country?

238
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:45,214
We power our food down with caffeine,
carbonation,

239
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,826
and high fructose corn syrup.

240
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:51,245
No one ever takes the time
to enjoy things anymore.

241
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,468
Denise, would you do me the honor
of "enjoying"

242
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,229
the rest of your lunch with me?

243
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,876
I think I'd like that.

244
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,237
White or red?

245
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,404
...and with limited financial resources
he poses no flight risk...

246
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,571
Unless he'd rather not stand trial
for capital murder.

247
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,031
The defendant has shown
great resourcefulness

248
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,416
in being able to travel across country
with little money.

249
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:32,174
There's no reason
he couldn't do it again.

250
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:36,108
If you don't want to believe me,
believe Mr. Bellick.

251
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,583
<i>You thieving son of a bitch.</i>

252
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,664
<i>You better get down on your knees
and pray to God</i>

253
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,404
<i>that I never find you because if I do,</i>

254
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:47,554
<i>mark my words:
I will gut you bow to stern.</i>

255
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:53,411
He promised to kill Mr. Geary,

256
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,911
and then he kept that promise.

257
00:14:56,215 --> 00:15:00,864
A man like the defendant
should not be out in society.

258
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,251
I concur.

259
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:05,566
Bail denied.

260
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,002
Who would that be?

261
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:14,751
Only one person.

262
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:20,371
Michael, it's me. Listen,
this phone rang last night and...

263
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,486
I went to answer it,
but I couldn't hear anything

264
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:24,532
and I... I wonder if maybe it was you?

265
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,646
I don't know what to do right now,
if I should leave a message

266
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:30,499
or who might be
listening to this, but...

267
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:33,965
I need to know that you're okay.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,500
I need you to know that I'm not.

269
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,667
I didn't leave you in Gila.
Something happened to me and I don't...

270
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:42,749
I don't know what to do right now.
I'm not too sure where to go,

271
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,916
but I know that you're the only person
I can trust and I need you to...

272
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,370
I need you to be okay and...

273
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:57,091
And I need you. Please.

274
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:35,885
Alexander Mahone, Bureau.

275
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,598
These are my prisoners and I will be
personally escorting them

276
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,192
in their transfer vehicle.

277
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,170
- You can follow in the chase car...
- I don't believe you heard me.

278
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,242
I'll be accompanying them in their...

279
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,382
The only people allowed
in the van are the driver

280
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:54,768
and two guards who've been trained
and certified in prison transport.

281
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:00,431
Are you really going to make me
go over your head?

282
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:03,634
I'll even dial the phone for you.

283
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,623
Now look, this is standard procedure,
Agent Mahone.

284
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,685
We need to keep that environment
as controllable as possible.

285
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:12,065
The more bodies, the less control.

286
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:16,864
These men may have knowledge
of the location of the other escapees.

287
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,060
This is knowledge that I...

288
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:21,608
I need to do my job.

289
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:25,134
And my job is to ensur
the safe and successful transfer

290
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:26,705
of these two prisoners.

291
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,501
Chase vehicles are right outside.

292
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:46,960
There better be a damn good reason
why those brothers are still alive.

293
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,126
Bad day, Bill?

294
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:52,950
Sorry, I thought this was someone
who still existed.

295
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,522
<i>How's the jerky business, Owen?</i>

296
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:56,834
Actually, it's looking pretty good
right about now.

297
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,793
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

298
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,759
Actually, you don't kill Burrows
and Scofield today, so are you.

299
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:05,055
<i>You know it and I know it, and luckily
for you, I know how to save your ass.</i>

301
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:12,473
The brothers are already
being transferred.

302
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:13,835
You're too late.

303
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,881
Actually, that transport van is exactl
where you want them to be, Bill.

304
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:20,273
<i>Why?</i>

305
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:23,618
Why? You want my help, Bill,
I want my job back.

306
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,962
<i>That means direct access
to the President.</i>

307
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,129
<i>I report only to her.</i>

308
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:29,894
You're reaching, Paul. Good-bye.

309
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:31,358
<i>Don't shut me out, Bill.</i>

310
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:34,354
<i>You think Burrows and Scofield
are a threat to this Administration?</i>

311
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:36,674
<i>I know everything
Caroline Reynolds has done.</i>

312
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:38,523
<i>Everything.</i>

313
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:40,023
Now, before you panic,

314
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:44,343
all I'm asking is to be allowed
to finish the job that I started.

315
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,585
<i>To prove to the President and to you</i>

316
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,746
that I'm still an asset
to this Administration.

317
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,087
What's your plan?

318
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:57,961
<i>I have an old associate
in the Illinois DOC.</i>

319
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,646
<i>They're heading up the transfer.</i>

320
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,148
<i>It's going to take more
than one guy on the inside.</i>

321
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,149
<i>Not if the guy's in the right place.</i>

322
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,084
Bill, you give me the go-ahead on this,

323
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,772
when those brothers get in the van,

324
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,828
it'll be the last thing they ever do.

325
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:37,238
I have never done that before.

326
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:43,461
Then I guess we were making up
for some lost time.

327
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,634
I have to ask, Sam, are you...

328
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,090
- are you married or something?
- Me? No.

329
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,745
- What makes you think...?
- Come on.

330
00:20:54,931 --> 00:20:56,870
I may be plain, but I'm not a fool.

331
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:59,363
Usually the men I end up with
are just looking for something,

332
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,636
you know... on the side.

333
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:09,576
Denise, the only "side"
I'm interested in, is the inside.

334
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,123
And that place within you...

335
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,804
is not plain.

336
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,403
I have to get back to work.

337
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:20,585
Do you really?

338
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:22,015
I have to close tonight.

339
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,484
How 'bout I pick you up after?

340
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:27,109
We can have dinner.

341
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:29,694
- Are you sure?
- Denise...

342
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:31,693
I insist.

343
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:49,841
<i>Good news.</i>

344
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:51,452
<i>You're off the hook.</i>

345
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,557
Paul Kellerman has a team ready

346
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:55,806
to move on the caravan
just outside of Albuquerque.

347
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:58,432
So where does that leave us?

348
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,811
When it goes down, there's sure
to be a moment or two of chaos.

349
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,835
A certain amount of confusion,
lots of bullets flying.

350
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,745
I need you there to make sur
Paul Kellerman catches one.

351
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:15,084
It's a little early to be covering
your tracks, isn't it?

352
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:19,404
The escapees.
That was our deal.

353
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:20,556
That's all.

354
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:21,557
Right.

355
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:23,332
Our deal.

356
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:26,243
Refresh my memory.

357
00:22:26,282 --> 00:22:28,439
<i>Was our deal supposed
to end with Burrows and Scofield</i>

358
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:30,019
<i>going back to prison or...</i>

359
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,807
bleeding from a hole in their heads?

360
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,766
We're giving you a chance
to make this right, Alex.

361
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,994
Just let Kellerman take care of it.

362
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:40,217
Let him be our Oswald.

363
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:42,744
Then, that makes me your Jack Ruby.

364
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:44,356
<i>Jack Ruby was working alone.</i>

365
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,013
<i>You've got the support

366
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,801
of the United States government
behind you, Alex.</i>

367
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:50,518
Good luck in Albuquerque.

368
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:02,990
I promise, sir,
this will all be over shortly

369
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:06,287
and it will be back
to business as usual.

370
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:12,553
Do you regret it?

371
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,933
What?

372
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,032
Knowing what you know now,
do you regret helping me?

373
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:21,663
You'd have done the same thing for me.

374
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,471
You think?

375
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:25,997
I know.

376
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:30,299
You didn't answer the question.

377
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:34,265
I don't regret the act.

378
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,956
Just how it turned out.

379
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,997
We've got a premeditated murder
on our hands.

380
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:46,369
You wanted to steal money
and then kill the only witness.

381
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,119
Are you my attorney or theirs?
I told you I didn't do anything.

382
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,809
No, I'm just explaing
their theory of what happened.

383
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,245
Your explanation to the cops
that you didn't kill Geary

384
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,509
because you were too busy

385
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:58,481
trying to steal five million
in federally insured money.

386
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:00,122
Probably not the best move.

387
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:02,899
But there is good news.

388
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:03,997
What's that?

389
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:06,070
The DA is willing to offer a deal.

390
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,901
25 years.

391
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,182
No.

392
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,586
Brad, they'll drop the capital charge.

393
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:13,558
- No death penalty.
- No.

394
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,038
I'd be almost 65 when I get out.

395
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:17,468
But you'd get out.

396
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,191
If this case goes to trial,

397
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:21,933
there's an excellent chance
you're sentenced to death.

398
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:24,434
I've been doing this a while,

399
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:27,930
and I can tell you
these things never go down good.

400
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:32,324
When the system wants you,
they get you, one way or another.

401
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:42,169
Part of the deal's
got to be I do my time in Illinois,

402
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:45,946
so I can be near my mom.

403
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:07,619
Where are they taking us?

404
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:09,122
Another foster home.

405
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:11,031
I don't want to go. I liked it there.

406
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:12,722
I know you did.

407
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:16,506
It's 'cause of you.
The reason they're making us move?

408
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,284
'Cause
you were getting in trouble again.

409
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,033
Yeah, and I'm sorry.

410
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:30,560
Seems like I've been dragging you
into trouble my whole life.

411
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:32,706
Pulled me out of some, too.

412
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:02,191
Alex. Paul Kellerman.

413
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,136
Have you spoken with Bill Kim?

414
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:06,277
Yeah, he filled me in.

415
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,013
You're staging in Albuquerque.

416
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:09,408
<i>Now, listen.</i>

417
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:10,970
Me jumping in at this point.

418
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,655
It in no way reflect my feelings

419
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:13,969
about the job you've been doing.

420
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,692
<i>I just wanted you to know that.</i>

421
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,658
Of course.

422
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:20,880
So long as we get the job done.

423
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:23,782
And we all get
to go back to our families, right?

424
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,060
The sooner, the better.

425
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:27,281
So what do I need to know?

426
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,642
<i>As be first reported last night,
after nine days on the run,</i>

427
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:35,429
<i>fugitives Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield</i>

428
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:38,838
<i>two of the mastermind
behind the Fox River Eight escape</i>

429
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:41,346
<i>were aprehended by
border patrol officials</i>

430
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:42,709
<i>near the Mexican border.</i>

431
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:46,311
<i>And they are being sent back
to Fox River penitentiary today.</i>

432
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,485
- What's going on out there?
- Let me go check.

433
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:52,176
- What do you see?
- I'll let you know.

434
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,421
How much time to move the semi?

435
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,106
I've got my men working on it now.

436
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:12,424
What's going on up there?

437
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,036
Are you in a hurry, convict?

438
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:19,401
We need some help
getting this rig out of the road.

439
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:36,485
All right, let's say
we get the cuffs off. Where do we go?

440
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:39,987
There.

441
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:41,985
That's too easy.

442
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,861
Come on. Come on, Michael, take it.

443
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:51,299
Come on, come on.

444
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:56,362
Take it.

445
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,612
Take it and run.

446
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,111
Let's think about this.

447
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:21,112
The keys are accidentally left out,
the door is accidentally left open.

448
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:23,523
- It's our only shot.
- It's their only shot.

449
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:26,235
They don't have an excuse
to kill us unless we give it to them.

450
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:27,236
How are we doing?

451
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:28,361
<i>Nothing so far.</i>

452
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:29,798
<i>None?</i>

453
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:33,161
- They're talking, that's all.
- <i>If they haven't bitten in 5 minutes,</i>

454
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,551
you haul the semi,
you tell them it's fixed.

455
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:36,778
You release traffic.

456
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:37,736
And do what?

457
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:40,601
If you want the rabbit to hop,
you move the carrot, Alex.

458
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,799
You showed.

459
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:05,125
A gentleman always does.

460
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:07,431
Where are we going to eat?

461
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:09,222
Wherever your heart desires.

462
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:14,515
You know, there's just one
teensy-tiny thing I been meaning to ask.

463
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:16,981
Anything.

464
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:24,170
You know, forwarding addresses
are supposed to be confidential.

465
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,004
I really shouldn't be doing this.

466
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,404
You shouldn't have been doing
a lot of the things

467
00:30:29,405 --> 00:30:30,330
we did this afternoon,

468
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,396
but, neither of us
has been smited down yet.

469
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,482
There she is.

470
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:41,775
I'd imagine
your cousin'll be pretty surprised

471
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:44,158
to hear about
the money her uncle left her.

472
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:45,813
You can be certain of it.

473
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,161
Sam, I hope
you don't mind me asking, but...

474
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,262
your hand.

475
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,282
What happened to it?

476
00:30:59,170 --> 00:30:59,674
I'm sorry.

477
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:02,547
I didn't want to make you feel
uncomfortable. I just...

478
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,407
I want to know you.

479
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:09,302
I want to know
everything about you, and...

480
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:12,977
if this is a part of who you are,
then I want to know how it...

481
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,044
Oh, dear God.

482
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,733
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

483
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:55,747
Here's what I'm thinking.

484
00:31:55,786 --> 00:31:56,781
You and some of the boys

485
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,604
get yourselves transferred
over to AD SEG.

486
00:31:58,605 --> 00:31:59,969
That way, we can spend our days

487
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,906
playing Scrabble
and watching Sportscenter.

488
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:03,594
Then, in about a year and a half or so,

489
00:32:03,614 --> 00:32:06,230
you're gonna recommend me
for one of those work-release programs.

490
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:08,116
Then,
I can sweat off the rest of my time

491
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:09,418
heaving hay and getting sun.

492
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,730
- That's...
- It ain't freedom, but it's damn close.

493
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:13,722
Is that
why you requested to be sent here?

494
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:16,765
I go anywhere else...
as a former CO, I'm a dead man.

495
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:19,293
But here I got men to watch my back.

496
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:20,718
Get me the finest accommodations...

497
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:22,300
They're not putting you in AD SEG.

498
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:24,781
I don't carewhere they're putting me.
Just take me to AD SEG.

499
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:26,411
It's not like it used to be, Cap'n.

500
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:28,230
The COs don't run the game here anymore.

501
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:29,841
- What do you mean?
- This new warden.

502
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:31,055
He's cracking down.

503
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:34,852
And to prove he's serious
about showing preferential treatment,

504
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:37,238
he's making an example out of you.

505
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:41,696
Lou, what the hell is this?

506
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:43,482
General Pop.

507
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,919
Welcome home, Boss.

508
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:16,750
Okay, everybody, we're moving out.

509
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,691
Window's closing, Michael.
Once the truck moves, we're...

510
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:33,744
If we run now, we give them permission
to put a bullet in our heads.

511
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:36,869
We stay, I'm dead within the week,
and you're locked up for life.

512
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:39,032
Or until they find a way to get to you.

513
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,188
And, believe me, they will.

514
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:42,655
If we go back to prison,
we'll have a few extra days.

515
00:35:42,713 --> 00:35:44,179
We'll have a chance to contact Sara.

516
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,735
We don't know where Sara is.

517
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:47,245
Sara may be dead, Michael.

518
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:52,685
Let me get us out of here
the only way I know how.

519
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:54,348
- Fighting?
- Yeah.

520
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:01,744
Get the keys.

521
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:09,280
Here we go. Here we go.

522
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:10,494
Copy that.

523
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:12,973
All right, we're on.

524
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:13,995
<i>Heads up.</i>

525
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
<i>Hold traffic.</i>

526
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:32,285
You know we have no idea
what's behind that door.

527
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:34,538
Nope.

528
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,982
You ready?

529
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:39,195
No. You?

530
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:40,288
No.

531
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,039
Let's go.

532
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,985
Just pray
there's another way out of here.

533
00:38:25,538 --> 00:38:26,538
Hey, they're in.

534
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,288
And they're heading straight for you.

535
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,289
Armed?

536
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,479
No. Where are you? I'll back you up.

537
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:32,479
<i>Just keep moving.</i>

538
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:35,037
As long as they're running from you,
they're running toward me.

539
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:36,038
They're boxed in.

540
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:08,103
Hold on one sec.

541
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:11,897
Can I write a check for the food?

542
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,317
- 'Cause I don't have...
- Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

543
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,457
They say a good woman is hard to find.

544
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:21,592
Well, if that's true,
you must be very, very...

545
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:24,288
very good.

546
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,203
Don't be frightened.

547
00:39:28,414 --> 00:39:29,414
Teddy's home.

548
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:20,587
They're improvising,
heading toward the surface.

549
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,568
- Where to?
- I don't know.

550
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,531
Look, if something happens to us,

551
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,534
if we get separated
or one of us doesn't make it,

552
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:40,094
promise me you'll find Sara.

553
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:42,586
- We're gonna make it.
- Just promise me.

554
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,905
I promise. Come on.

555
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:16,789
President Reynolds ruined your life.

556
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:18,138
She ruined my life.

557
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:20,996
You want to take that bitch down?

558
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,187
You just found your inside man,
but it's got to be right now.

559
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:26,596
Let's go!

560
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:27,783
Now!

561
