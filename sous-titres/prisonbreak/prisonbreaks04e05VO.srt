1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,900
It was a meeting between
all six cardholders.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,000
So now we know who has
the other five cards.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,600
Your nose is bleeding.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,190
I'm Cole Pfeiffer.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,800
Welcome to Los Angeles.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,390
His name is Theodore Bagwell.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,790
He was with us in Panama,

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,500
And now he's here in Los Angeles,

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,790
And he has a book that
used to belong to Whistler.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,300
Mahone thinks this book has
a plan for the break-in.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,790
Cole Pfeiffer did not arrive for our meeting.

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
You Don't have Scylla?

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,000
It seems your friend Whistler wasn't the only one

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Looking into Scylla.

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,200
You know anything about that? No.

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm looking for the
man who killed my son.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,890
This man is a professional assassin.

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,700
He's african american, six-foot, four,

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
About 220 pounds.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,090
We refined the image the best we could,

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,090
But we're going to need

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,690
One of your specialists
to sharpen the video

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,200
So we can i.D. The rest of them.

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,700
All right, I'll see what I can do.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But I've seen what those tech
guys are capable of.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sometimes, it's...

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Wait a sec, I know this guy.

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,090
This guy works in my building.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,800
That's Griffin Oren. You know him?

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,890
I know of him.

32
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,700
He's the head of treasury's L.A. Bureau.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Well, if he's in your building
you can get close to him.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,290
I would need a reason. Well,
you make something up.

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,990
Something about Al Qaeda
using stolen bearer bonds

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
To finance shady operations, whatever.

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,090
Come on, making false claims

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,390
In matters affecting government?

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
That's up to five years in prison.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Welcome to the club, agent Self.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,790
Thanks for meeting me.

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,090
I would have come out to see you,

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,390
But I can't travel that far...

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm sorry...

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,000
But you said that you had
some pictures to show me.

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,900
That's him.

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,190
I'll get in touch with you

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
As soon as...

49
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,300
As soon as... I find out.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,700
You didn't do this.

51
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
In your heart, you are a really

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,200
Good man.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,100
That's why I married you.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,100
That's why I started a family with you.

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,490
Remember when you used to bring your files home

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,100
And I would beg you to
leave that stuff at work?

57
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,700
But when you have a monster in your sights...

58
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,000
You can't focus

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
Until you get him.

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
I used to hate that about you.

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,800
Right now it's the only
thing that lets me sleep,

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Because I know...

63
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,900
You're going to get him.

64
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
What are you doing?

65
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
Hey there, Blauney.

66
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,400
Just, uh...

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,900
Doing a little research.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,900
Gate-related?

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
I'm adding a little flourish to my pitch.

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,990
"like the caged macaw

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
Who cannot spread her wings."

72
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,200
You know, Cole...

73
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,390
I was thinking maybe you
should spend a little less Time

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Practicing and a little more Time

75
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,600
Actually pitching.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,100
I mean, number one salesman in the world?

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,990
We're all just waiting with bated breath

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
To see what you can do around here.

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
We saw him right here.

80
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,090
You haven't seen Sara, have you?

81
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,900
No.

82
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,990
You want to end up back in Fox River,

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,300
You just go right ahead.

84
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,590
Hey, what's going on?

85
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,590
He wants to look for t-bag.
You're damn right I want to look for him.

86
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,890
We know he's got the bird book.

87
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,000
We know the bird book's got
the plan for the break-in.

88
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,900
And we saw that snake right here today.

89
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,590
All I'm saying is, it ain't safe

90
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,390
For a member of The Fox River
Eight to be out there looking

91
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
For another member of
The Fox River eight. Yes, but...

92
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,990
Bellick, I want you to go with Sucre,

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,890
Canvass the area, see if you can get a lead on him.

94
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,590
There are like six big buildings over there.

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
He could be in any one of them.

96
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
That's why it's called canvassing.

97
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,500
You do realize this is
the treasury department, right?

98
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,490
You tell Self to go
down a few floors,

99
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,890
Walk past the right computers

100
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,500
And we are billionaires.

101
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,800
Just the card, please.

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,890
Don Self, homeland security.

103
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,790
I need to see mr. Oren right away.
He's not available.

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,990
Ma'am, I need to see him

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,390
Right away, otherwise
hundreds of american lives

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Will be in jeopardy.

107
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Don Self, homeland security.

108
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,300
Talk to Angela down the hall.

109
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,590
Sir, I'm sorry to barge in here,

110
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,590
But this is urgent.

111
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,590
I'm sure it is.

112
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,290
Talk to Angela down the hall.

113
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,490
Sir, we are hearing chatter
about some stolen bearer bonds,

114
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,490
And we have reason to believe
that al qaeda operatives...

115
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
You have serial numbers?

116
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,200
No, I do not.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,990
Mind turning around?

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,100
Not at all.

119
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,900
I leave for asia in six hours.

120
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
He's got it.

121
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,200
Until then...

122
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,190
I've got meetings with the bureau chiefs

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Of the fbi, the cia and homeland security.

124
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,100
It's gone.

125
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
If what you tell me is actually important,

126
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,900
I'll hear about it from your boss.

127
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,490
Until then...

128
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,600
Talk to Angela down the hall.

129
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,990
And if you set foot

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,090
In my office again
without my prior consent,

131
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,390
I will see to it that
you spend the rest

132
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Of our career running
border security in alaska.

133
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,500
Did we get it?

134
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,300
What happened?

135
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
What do you mean what happened?

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,500
We had it for two seconds
and then it disappeared.

137
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
It's in the safe.

138
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,690
He has this crazy safe in his office.

139
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,400
That must have been
blocking the transmission.

140
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,890
I'll bet you that's
where he keeps the card.

141
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,400
So we need to get into that safe.

142
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,100
Trust me, there's no way to crack that thing.

143
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,390
Look, I'll have the enhanced
images of the other cardholders

144
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
In a couple of hours-- we'll go from there.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
You can access the building's blueprints, right?

146
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
I can't go back up there.

147
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,700
No one's asking you. We'll take care of that.

148
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,690
Come on, you'll never get
past the front door, okay?

149
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,990
Even if they Don't recognize you,

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,590
You need a security card that matches...

151
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
Get the blueprints and get back here, all right?

152
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,100
Yeah...

153
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,500
Sara, what happened?

154
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm fine, but someone was following me.

155
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,690
I lost him about a mile back.

156
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,290
I Don't think there's any way
he could have followed me here.

157
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,700
I made sure of that. What'd he look like?

158
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,590
Uh, tall, Black. He had a beard.

159
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,900
This the guy?

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

161
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Who's that?

162
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
That's the man who killed my son.

163
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,300
Now he is coming to kill us.

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,290
Where were you the first
Time that you saw him?

165
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,800
The very first Time?

166
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Walking home.

167
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,400
He didn't just run into you on the street?

168
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,500
Where were you before that?

169
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,700
The Towne Lounge.

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Is that a bar?

171
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,300
Do you have a problem with that?

172
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,500
No, I just want to know
how long you were there.

173
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,100
Sara,

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,390
I need to find this guy and
I can't do it without your help.

175
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,490
I Don't care why or what you
were doing in the bar.

176
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,890
I just really want to know
how long you were there.

177
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,300
Okay. A couple hours.

178
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you. So something must
have tipped him off.

179
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,890
You paid cash, right?

180
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Of course.

181
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,100
But the credit card that
Bruce gave me is gone.

182
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,700
What credit card?

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,100
These are the security checkpoints.

184
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
You can't get past one of those
unless you have one of these.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,300
Any way we can forge it?

186
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,590
Sure, if you have two weeks and access

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,800
To the building's mainframe maybe.

188
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,590
Well, doesn't look like there
are any security checkpoints

189
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,990
On the tenth floor. No, just that

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
All the access points to the tenth floor.

191
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,990
But if you could somehow magically appear

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,690
And wind up in the middle of
the hallway, you'd be fine,

193
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,690
Except for all the government
officials who'd be swarming

194
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,600
Around and who would
arrest you in a heartbeat.

195
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,990
And if you can get us
into the parking structure,

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,700
Will security check our van?

197
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Sure. Transporting known felons, why not?

198
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,900
So, the parking garage.

199
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,890
This is our point of entry.

200
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,100
We need the details to the safe.

201
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Okay, the, um, the safe has an insignia on it.

202
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,500
It looks something like this.

203
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,300
You're gonna need some of this.

204
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
I got a positive id of Sara Tancredi in los angeles.

205
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
That means Michael Scofield was here.

206
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,900
That means Lincoln Burrows is here. Why?

207
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,700
Sara, huh?

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
She's a slippery little bitch, isn't she?

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,400
Time is not on your side, Gretchen.

210
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Maybe you hadn't noticed,

211
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,290
But since you seem to be somewhat immune

212
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,700
To physical coercion,

213
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
We've decided to move on.

214
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,100
The nose is an evolutionary marvel.

215
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,400
Our brain has been constructed
so that certain aromas...

216
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,190
...Coffee beans, blueberries
that are helpful to our body,

217
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
We perceive as pleasant.

218
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
Whereas other smells that signify death,

219
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Disease.

220
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Initial symptoms include nausea, dizziness,

221
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,100
Burning eyes, all of which you
are experiencing right now.

222
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,500
Prolonged exposure will lead to faintness,

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Rapid degradation of your mental faculties.

224
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
Tell me.

225
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,800
I Don't know anything.

226
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,600
You've got one more Day.

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,100
Top of the line.

228
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,580
It's a biometric design,

229
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,750
And only Oren's fingerprint will open it.

230
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,580
So we lift his prints off
something he touched.

231
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,460
The pad knows what human
skin feels like.

232
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,560
If we try to trick it,
we'll set off the alarm.

233
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,690
And then there's the 12-digit key code.

234
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,710
What about the hinges?

235
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,750
Wired to the alarm.

236
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,870
We drill it.

237
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,420
Through the outer
layer of steel maybe,

238
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,280
But the bones of this thing
are three-quarters inch

239
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,340
Of cobalt alloy hard plate.

240
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,630
Drilling's not gonna work,
not in our Timeframe.

241
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,300
All right, so basically,
we have a way to get you

242
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,560
Into the garage, which,
in case you guys forgot,

243
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,000
That puts me on the hook
for another four charges.

244
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,120
But no way to get you up to the tenth floor.

245
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,240
But let's say you do
get up to the tenth floor.

246
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,310
Then we need to get you into
Oren's office for an hour

247
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,590
During the middle of the Day.

248
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,820
Then, we need to hope

249
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,060
That not one of Oren's
co-workers is gonna hear

250
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,080
The extremely loud drill that
you're gonna be using

251
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,850
To break into a safe that I'm telling you

252
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,400
Cannot be broken into.

253
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,030
Do you understand there are homeland agents

254
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,800
Whose sole job is to design safety measures

255
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,740
To make this structure impregnable.

256
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah. They had those guys Fox River, too.

257
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,020
Whose office is this?

258
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,340
Sam Middleton, department of justice.

259
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,900
This wall separates Middleton from Warren.

260
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,440
I'm gonna need some supplies.

261
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,020
The credit card was used at the bar at 10:32.

262
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,370
What Time did you see him?

263
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,410
About 11:00.

264
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,370
And how long were you walking at that Time?

265
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,390
Ten, 15 minutes.

266
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,620
Let's assume that he was at his
place when we received the call.

267
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,050
That's an 18-minute drive

268
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,450
From the Towne Lounge bar in San Pedro.

269
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,470
Averaging 30 miles an hour the whole way,

270
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,800
That's a, that's a nine-mile radius.

271
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,570
So he's gonna be somewhere
around the perimeter

272
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,480
Of that circle. He's got to be mobile

273
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,390
Within a half mile of a major freeway.

274
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,640
The 10, the 110, the 405.

275
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,830
No permanent address,
so we're looking for hotels, right?

276
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,410
Yeah, but nowhere where you
need to valet your car.

277
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,050
It's got to be readily
accessible at all Times.

278
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,110
And somewhere you Don't need

279
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,560
To put a credit card down for incidentals.
You got that?

280
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,900
I'll see what I can do.

281
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,430
Hurry.

282
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,130
Trishanne, I'm gonna need
a mug of tea with lemon.

283
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,850
I'm sorry, Cole.
I can't leave the desk right now.

284
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,820
Good help is so hard to find.

285
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,610
May I help you?

286
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,750
We're with Upper Valley Insurance.

287
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,440
And this man just came
into a $100,000 inheritance.

288
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,660
We can't track him down,
so we're offering

289
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,170
A ten percent finder's fee

290
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,660
To anyone who can point
us in his direction.

291
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,700
Oh, my gosh. What, $10,000?

292
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,660
Yeah.

293
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,140
I'm sorry. I Don't recognize him.

294
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,890
Okay, so if you do see him,
would you please give us a call?

295
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,780
Thank you.

296
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,050
"gate"?

297
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,080
"greatness achieved through excellence."

298
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,710
A toy?

299
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,340
You want to try to explain this?

300
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,530
Mix aluminum powder with iron oxide.

301
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,950
Add a little heat.

302
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,570
Hey. Yeah, well, thanks for
calling me back, Sam.

303
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,820
Yeah. No, I just, I know you
have these trial dates coming up

304
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,490
And we just want to make sure
you have everything you need

305
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,150
To convict these bastards.

306
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,660
Okay, that's terrific.

307
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,090
All right, I'll see you then.

308
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,700
All right,

309
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,720
We're gonna have lunch.

310
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,830
I'll keep him out of his office
for as long as I can.

311
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,410
Good luck.

312
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,170
All right.

313
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,340
Hello. Hey, any sign of him?

314
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,610
No, we checked about ten buildings,

315
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,950
But nothing so far.

316
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,190
Well, scrap it; we're
going after the next card.

317
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,070
Meet me on the corner of
santa monica and century west.

318
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,270
Hey, Charlie.

319
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,990
Yankees lost again last night.

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,350
Yeah, well, at least our fans show up

321
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,980
Before the fifth inning, right?

322
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,100
Have a good Day, all right, Charlie?

323
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,730
You, too, mr. Self.

324
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,980
I'm letting you guys know right now.

325
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,540
If you get caught, Don't mention my name.

326
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,650
All ready?

327
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,110
Now!

328
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,800
You lift me up.

329
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,980
So...

330
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,420
A couple of scruffy guys walk in,

331
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,340
Tell me they're from the insurance Company

332
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,750
And they offer me $10,000
if I know where you are.

333
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,590
Something tells me

334
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,330
There's a better offer on the table.

335
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,620
Well, I'll be, Trishanne.

336
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,990
You just caught yourself a leprechaun.

337
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,010
And as the legend goes,

338
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,460
You got yourself one wish,
anything in the world.

339
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,290
Oh, really?

340
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,140
And I am bound to grant it.

341
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,620
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

342
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,910
Well, your commencement
check's sitting on my desk

343
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,410
Waiting to be signed.

344
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,410
That's a pretty Nice pot of gold.

345
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,570
Before you say another word...

346
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,110
Now, it's true

347
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,860
Leprechauns cannot refuse
their captor's demands,

348
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,370
But if they deem her

349
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,050
To be greedy or covetous,

350
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,500
Whatever she desires will
certainly be accompanied

351
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,320
With disastrous tidings.

352
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,840
Or so the legend goes.

353
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,710
Three percent of your commission

354
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,140
From here on out.

355
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,420
Done.

356
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,140
Don Self to see you.

357
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,810
You can go right on in.

358
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,440
Thank you. Have a great Day.

359
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,120
Hey, hey.

360
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,280
Hey, Sam.

361
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,960
Great to meet you.

362
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,720
Same here.

363
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,150
Oh, thanks again for squeezing me in

364
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,130
On such short notice.

365
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,100
I figure we had so much

366
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,100
To get through, this'd be the best way.

367
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,910
I-i thought we were going out for lunch.

368
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,510
Is there a problem?

369
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,770
Actually, um...

370
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,210
I'm a vegetarian.

371
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,690
It's a new diet, b-b-but there's

372
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,870
A great place down the street,

373
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,530
And it'll be my treat.

374
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,250
Elise.

375
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,740
Yes, sir?

376
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,090
I'm heading out for lunch.

377
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,630
Hold it there.

378
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,810
Sorry, I was just coming in to...

379
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,950
There's no more tp in the ladies room.

380
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,580
We'll get right on that.

381
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,210
How about you get it right now?

382
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,590
Best we got in here.

383
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,670
You guys need to get better organized.

384
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,980
53 hotels match the search criteria.

385
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,930
You know I read, I read this article

386
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,450
A little while ago, right?

387
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,370
About the whole, uh,
nature versus nurture thing,

388
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,210
And it turns out, it's all kind of a mishmash

389
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,930
Because dna trumps everything.

390
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,270
And I believe it, because

391
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,260
I mean, I grew up in the Same house,

392
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,470
Uh, went to the Same school as my brother,

393
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,110
Who's a math professor,

394
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,100
My sister's a pediatrician.

395
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,430
And I'm a thief who blows his money

396
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,950
On hookers and coke.

397
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,330
So, like the Same way Scofield's
hardwired to be a genius,

398
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,490
And you are always
gonna be a lawman, right?

399
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,190
I mean, whoever this guy is,

400
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,550
You think he wanted to
grow up to be a murderer?

401
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,020
Probably not.

402
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,580
Be very careful choosing the next words

403
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,210
That come out of your mouth.

404
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,360
I... I'm just saying.

405
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,580
We are who we are.

406
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,520
Jake. I'm gonna need you in front
of room 1018. Now.

407
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,230
What's going on? I apologize, ma'am,

408
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,060
But we're gonna be in your way

409
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,000
For the next 90 minutes or so.

410
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,170
Black?

411
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,280
Yeah.

412
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,730
Excuse me, ma'am,

413
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,110
But where can I plug in?

414
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,090
For now, you can go in there,

415
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,500
But when my boss gets back from lunch,

416
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,270
You're gonna...

417
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,620
The safe should be somewhere behind this wall.

418
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,130
As soon as you're through the steel,

419
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,370
I'll have the thermite ready.

420
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,240
What is it?

421
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,380
How long has it been happening?

422
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,500
It's not a big deal.

423
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,090
It was a big deal when you were 13.

424
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,370
Just promise me you won't tell Sara.

425
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,240
Sara's a doctor. She can help.

426
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,930
Look, I acclimating to the warmer climate,
all right?

427
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,820
Come on. We've got work to do.

428
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,630
Let's go.

429
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,820
I Don't know what this Company is up to,
but it sure

430
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,600
Sounds like there's a whole
lot of money involved.

431
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,050
I Don't know.

432
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,370
Lisa Tabak just hopped a flight to Laos,
didn't she?

433
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,310
Yeah, I guess.

434
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,410
And now Griffin Oren just said

435
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,350
He was going somewhere in asia.

436
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,760
Down to the cobalt.

437
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,740
Right.

438
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,720
What can I get you?

439
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,360
Just a moment of your Time.

440
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,510
I'm a private investigator,

441
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,450
And I'm working with a woman

442
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,810
Named Sara Tancredi,

443
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,050
And she was recently a patron of yours.

444
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,410
I Don't want to get involved.

445
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,040
She moved all the way across the country

446
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,550
To get away from this guy.

447
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,580
Help me find him before he finds her.

448
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,730
Last Time, Sara had a broken jaw.

449
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,670
I was standing by the front door when he left.

450
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,700
A second later I saw him come past,

451
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,970
Take something out of his car.

452
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,310
Do you remember what the car looked like?

453
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,690
Gray. A sedan, sort of like one
of those rental cars, you know?

454
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,790
You need something?

455
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,520
Just a small...

456
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Kindness.

457
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,170
That's the easiest $300 you'll ever make.

458
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,070
We're working here.

459
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,460
So am i.

460
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,090
There's a stack of letters

461
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,620
That I need to put in the mail.

462
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,990
The chemicals, they Don't react
so good with leather.

463
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,450
What are you using, lye?

464
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,620
Wait, wait, wait.

465
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,180
Listen, we...

466
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,450
We know this is a hassle.

467
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,700
We know we're disrupting your work

468
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,120
And giving you a headache.

469
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,100
We annoy a different
person every Day,

470
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,140
But if this gets dirty
while it's still wet,

471
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,460
It's gonna leave a stain,

472
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,120
And... And, uh, and then we'll be

473
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,640
Back here all over again.

474
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,100
Why Don't you just
tell me where they are

475
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,660
And I'll get them for you?

476
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,010
On the corner of his desk
near his computer.

477
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,050
How much longer?

478
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,550
Another couple of minutes,
and we'll be ready to copy.

479
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,460
Is Griffin in?

480
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,010
He's in a meeting right now,

481
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,120
But I can pull him out if you'd like.

482
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,220
If you could.

483
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,830
Just have a seat in his office.

484
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,870
He'll be right with you.

485
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,120
All we need is one more.

486
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,940
Someone is in there.

487
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,420
If I could hear him sitting down,
there's no way

488
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,910
He's not gonna hear the drill.

489
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,870
You can do it manually.

490
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,230
Generate enough heat to
activate the thermite?

491
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,220
Come on, man, we're like
a 16th of an inch away from this.

492
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,560
Can I help you?

493
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,280
I phoned earlier about
one of your guests.

494
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,220
Gray sedan, right?

495
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,050
Yeah, right.

496
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,860
Is that the guy?

497
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,780
Yeah, that's him.

498
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,150
What room?

499
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,840
He was in 130.

500
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,910
He checked out.

501
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,230
Did, um...

502
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,330
Did he leave any clue as
to where he was going?

503
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,940
Do you mind if I look at the room?

504
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,360
$19 an hour, $59 for the night.

505
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,660
Fine, whatever, give me a key.

506
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:00,710
Yes.

507
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,240
You wanted to know if
anyone came looking for you.

508
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,330
Did they?

509
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,010
No. I was just calling to let you know

510
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,780
My shift was ending

511
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,040
And nobody showed up. All right.

512
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,850
Thank you.

513
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,640
What do you say you give me

514
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,810
That little piece of paper in your hand?

515
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,000
How's that sound, huh?

516
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,170
Sorry for keeping you.

517
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,530
To what do I owe the pleasure?

518
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,080
Just making sure you're
ready for your trip.

519
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,710
Well, I better be.
I'm leaving in five minutes.

520
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,010
All right, and if we dial it down

521
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,230
To the lowest setting, that might work.

522
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,410
Sure? We Don't have a choice.

523
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,440
I'll tell you when.

524
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,700
The finance minister's anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

525
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,790
Well, if you recall,
I successfully negotiated

526
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,040
Financial policies with the IMF and world bank.

527
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,040
Pretty sure I can handle Laos.

528
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,070
Now.

529
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,100
I'm well aware of your resume, Griffin.

530
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,590
Got it.

531
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,190
We're in.

532
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,350
Got it. The runaway inflation in Laos

533
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,020
Has given way to food riots

534
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,220
In the capital city of vientiane,

535
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,940
Where the death toll has risen over 200.

536
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,880
The monetary policy is a means to an end.

537
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,510
I'm aware of our final objective, general.

538
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,580
This is an important Day for us.

539
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,690
I need to make sure that
everyone knows his role.

540
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,450
You could've told me all of
this on the telephone.

541
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,360
Why did you take today of all
days to come down here

542
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,860
And berate me in person?

543
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,790
Things have happened in the past few Days

544
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,360
That have made me somewhat uneasy.

545
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,520
Today we got confirmation

546
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,330
That one of our targets is in los angeles.

547
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,670
That on top of the fact,

548
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,200
That one of Lisa's bodyguards was killed.

549
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,050
I thought that was because
she was married to that turk.

550
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,520
That's the official story.

551
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,010
What is it then?

552
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,150
Come on, come on.

553
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,040
Do you have your card on you, Griffin?

554
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:44,780
Of course.

555
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,170
I'd like to see it.

556
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,270
Where are we?

557
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,660
Talk to me Roland.

558
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,910
72%.

559
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,590
I put it in my safe this morning.

560
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,780
86.

561
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,100
87.

562
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,690
92.

563
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,560
15 years working together,
you think you'd trust me.

564
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,420
Don't turn this into an opera.

565
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,790
Just hand me the card.

566
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,120
Come on, come on.

567
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,840
Happy?

568
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,560
From now on, I'm asking

569
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,770
That everyone keep their card on them

570
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,900
At all Times.

571
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,130
Anyone makes a move,

572
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,310
Anything goes missing, you call me.

573
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,690
Did we get it?

574
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,670
100. Yeah.

575
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,780
I Don't know how you eat that crap, Don.

576
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,670
What was that called? Tempeh? Yeah.

577
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,440
It looked like you could
barely choke it down.

578
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,280
Yeah, well, it's an acquired taste.

579
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,530
Excuse us.

580
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,670
All right, well,

581
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,430
It looks like I should be getting back to work.

582
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,730
Oh. This was a pleasure.

583
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,580
Apparently, billions in counterfeit
currency flooded the economy,

584
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,920
Which is what caused it all.

585
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,300
What I Don't understand is why?

586
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,320
I mean, so far all the cardholders

587
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,570
Have been experts in their fields, right?

588
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,630
In-in energy, and logistics,

589
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,780
And finance.

590
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,090
I mean, it looks like

591
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,220
They're trying to tear the country down.

592
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,430
And then they profit by rebuilding it.

593
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,340
What's next?

594
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,050
I was at a bar earlier.

595
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,650
And nothing happened, and I didn't drink.

596
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,470
But... Look, if-if this is too much

597
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,420
No. No. For you...

598
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,570
Because, say the word,
and we'll scrap the whole thing.

599
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,920
That's a promise.
It's not going to happen again.

600
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,370
But it would be a lie not to tell you, and I...

601
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,900
Want you to know that I'll never lie to you.

602
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,890
I'm sorry.

603
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,340
Somebody's here for you.

604
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,850
For me?

605
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,170
Cole Pfeiffer.

606
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,180
Is your name Xing?

607
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,350
Mr. Xing stayed behind

608
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,020
In new York.

609
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,850
Well, have a seat then, uh--

610
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,670
What can I help you with?

611
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,890
You were supposed to deliver the item

612
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,950
Two Days ago.

613
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,730
Where is it?

614
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,130
Where's what?

615
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,360
I've traveled a long way,
Mr. Pfeiffer.

616
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
My patience is wearing thin.

617
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,530
Playing games is not going to
be good for either of us.

618
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,290
Scylla. Where is it?

619
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,200
Mr. Pfeiffer? I'm at work.

620
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,480
It's not exactly like I can talk freely,
you know.

621
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,210
Just-just tell me the latest.

622
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,090
The latest?

623
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:55,670
If you deliver it

624
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,380
To me by the end of the Day,

625
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,180
I will pay you the sum
that we agreed upon.

626
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,800
As much as I'd like to tell
you that were possible...

627
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,850
Get it to me by tomorrow

628
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,990
And you will receive 50% of your fee.

629
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,640
Two Days, 25%.

630
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,690
Three Days,

631
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,500
I shoot you through the brain.

632
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,550
That is the latest.

633
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,290
No problem.

634
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,990
I thought that urine might be
getting a little stale.

635
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,800
So I brought you some more.

636
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,620
Hey, the image enhancement for
the video came back.

637
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,780
Did you get what I sent over?

638
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,330
All three cardholders?

639
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,830
Yeah, well, for the first two,

640
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,580
We have names, addresses--

641
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,290
Everything we need to grab them.

642
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,290
Sara.

643
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,580
But for the general... We got nothing.

644
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,800
This guy's a ghost.

645
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,050
You all right?

646
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,490
Look, most of what happened
to me in Panama is a total blank.

647
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,640
But, um,

648
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,090
When I was being held, I could hear

649
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,740
Gretchen talking on the phone,
in the next room.

650
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,760
And she was taking orders

651
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,860
From the guy in charge.

652
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,300
And she called him the general.

653
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,430
In charge of the mission?

654
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
No, I think in charge of the Company.

655
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,910
I told you...

656
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,730
We should have killed Gretchen

657
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,830
When we had the chance.

658
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,050
She'll come home.

659
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,850
She always has.

660
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,760
You better be sure about that.

661
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,060
Excuse me, sir?

662
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,160
What?

663
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,910
Someone at homeland security

664
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,070
Did an enhanced image search on you today.

665
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,630
We couldn't tell where the original picture...

666
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,390
Who?

667
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,360
The guy who ordered it...

668
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,130
His name is Don Self.
