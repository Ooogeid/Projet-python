1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,930
My name is Michael Scoldfield.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,960
And I am a fugitive.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,090
Three weeks ago, I was in Panamanian Prison.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,310
I was there, I was approached by the company.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,830
The company is a corrupted orgnization. Involved all levels of industry and government.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,760
They gave me two options.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,760
Break one of their man James Whistler, out of that prison. 

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,740
Or they will kill the only woman that I ever loved.

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,910
Doctor Sarah Tancredi.

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,400
I held up my end of deal. And I broke Whistler out.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,650
But the comany, they killed Sarah anyway.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,820
I dont know why the company want James Whistler out of prison.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,580
But I have tracked him here to Los Angles.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,640
He is with another company agent that I only known as Gretchen.

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,150
The same agent who murdered Sarah.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,420
This ends today.

17
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,070
I came here seeking justice.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,350
The justice I now know the system can not provide.

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,130
So if you reading this letter, 

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,040
You know I died revenging Sarah's death.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,640
We drop it off in the racing form, and we get the hell

22
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,900
Out of there.

23
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,880
Who's the contact we're leaving it for?

24
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,770
The company wants the card back, period.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,850
All you need to worry about

26
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,550
Is getting this rig the hell out of there in a hurry.

27
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,980
Oh, I'll be getting it out of there.

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,360
Don't you worry about that.

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,930
You worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time.

30
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,130
If you pull this off, you can come up to my room later

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,180
And the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,800
Just make sure we get paid.

33
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,320
In and out.

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,330
Good to see you again.

35
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,450
You, too.

36
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,770
Didn't hear from you for a while.

37
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:49,950
Started to wonder if you were

38
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,750
Still interested. I am, very much so.

39
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,680
Well, I needed to approach this carefully.

40
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm sure you understand.

41
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,670
Who you buying it for?

42
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,360
A competitor?

43
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,390
A foreign country? jason,

44
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,090
You know I can't get into that.

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,760
Now, we've been negotiating this for months.

46
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,300
I've jumped through all your hoops.

47
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,520
I've agreed to meet you here.

48
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,170
Do you want to sell the card to me or not?

49
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,300
Be right back.

50
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,560
That's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic.

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,730
Let me give you a little bit of advice--

52
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,020
And this is on the house--

53
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,770
Watch your step with that thing.

54
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,360
The company will do anything to get it back.

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,750
Don't I know it.

56
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,630
What the hell are you doing? yeah.

57
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,100
I need to hide the gun.

58
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,890
Take the gun with you!

59
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,640
Where is she?

60
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,140
Michael, you don't understand.

61
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,920
Call gretchen, get her in here now.

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,350
You have to trust me.

63
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,170
I'm not your enemy, michael.

64
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,450
James.

65
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,850
We need to leave.

66
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,610
You know, despite everything...

67
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,650
If sara could weigh in right now,

68
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,840
She'd tell me not to kill you.

69
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,770
That's the kind

70
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,830
Of person she was.

71
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,980
That's the kind of person you took from me.

72
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,120
James,

73
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,620
Didn't you tell him?

74
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,830
He walked in five... shut up!

75
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,140
Gretchen, look at me.

76
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,330
This is for sara.

77
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,610
I never killed sara.

78
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,530
I wouldn't expect someone like you to take this with dignity.

79
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,360
I swear to god she's alive.

80
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,070
Don't.

81
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,530
Don't insult me and don't insult her.

82
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,560
She escaped.

83
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,680
We knew if you found out we wouldn't have any leverage.

84
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,570
I fabricated the whole thing.

85
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,700
My brother saw... a head in a box!

86
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,950
From a cadaver.

87
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,060
You ask lincoln what he really saw.

88
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,000
Listen to her, michael. don't lie to me.

89
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,180
I'm not lying to you. lincoln bought it,

90
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,370
You bought it, it worked.

91
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,750
Michael.

92
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,270
Then where is she?

93
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
I'll tell you when we get outside.

94
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,210
Right now,

95
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,050
We need to get out of here.

96
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,440
They found the bodies.

97
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,620
Give me the gun. she's lying.

98
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,730
Is she?

99
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,510
If you pull that trigger, you'll never know.

100
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,760
Kill him, james.

101
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,580
Shut up.

102
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,760
Where is she?

103
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,170
Where is sara?!

104
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,440
Michael,

105
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,690
If you don't give me that gun,

106
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm going to shoot you in the head.

107
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,450
Let's go.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,070
We got a double homicide at the roosevelt hotel.

109
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,770
Sara.

110
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,040
Do you know the difference

111
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,490
Between a perfectly executed operation

112
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,420
And a failed mission?

113
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,670
Sir? it's small unit leadership.

114
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,630
The allies spent two and a half years

115
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,820
Planning the invasion of normandy,

116
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,190
But on d-day it came down to a handful of men

117
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,800
On a strip of beach

118
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,720
To decide the fate of the world.

119
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,380
What I'm getting at, gretchen,

120
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,700
Is even the best plan is only as good

121
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,380
As the moving parts on the ground executing it.

122
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,100
General, we got your card-- what's the problem?

123
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,220
We have nothing.

124
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,740
It's a duplicate.

125
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,210
Almost flawless,

126
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,770
But a duplicate.

127
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,780
That's impossible.

128
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,870
I saw... you know

129
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,510
How important the retrieval of this card

130
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,710
Is to me, gretchen.

131
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,130
You know that this is a security breach

132
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,070
That could have catastrophic ramifications

133
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,980
For the company.

134
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,930
The only thing I can think of...

135
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,650
There was a blind spot

136
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,200
When whistler was hitting the target.

137
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,620
Maybe he made a duplicate and he still has the original.

138
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,310
You hired him.

139
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,970
You kept him at the tip of the spear.

140
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,290
You insisted that we get him out of sona.

141
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,050
We had to.

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,150
He had already made contact with the target.

143
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,310
At that point, it was him or no one, sir.

144
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,120
What's your stake in all of this?

145
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,300
I had nothing to do with it.

146
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,940
Whistler acted on his own.

147
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,240
I swear to you.

148
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,220
General, I can fix this.

149
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,260
You trained me.

150
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,440
Not well enough, apparently.

151
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,110
Please.

152
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,770
I have a bank account in dubai

153
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,870
Left over from a slush fund from cobra ii.

154
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,780
It's yours.

155
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,190
No, please, please...

156
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,500
Hello.

157
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,400
Hey, it's me.

158
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,870
Where are you, man?

159
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,260
Los angeles.

160
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,430
You okay, michael?

161
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,320
No, I'm, I'm safe.

162
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,580
Thank god, thank god.

163
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,010
How's lj

164
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,600
And sofia? yeah, they're, um...

165
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,420
I'm staring at them right now in fact.

166
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,410
They're fine.

167
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,540
You hear about sona?

168
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,750
What about it?

169
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,270
Burned down three days back.

170
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
The inmates-- they rioted.

171
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,600
No sign of bellick,

172
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,110
T-bag, or sucre.

173
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,230
Sucre?

174
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,040
He got popped-- I don't know how.

175
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,920
I mean, the papers listed the names of the inmates,

176
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,840
And he was in there when it went down.

177
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,010
I found whistler and gretchen...

178
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,900
And, uh...

179
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,650
...gretchen said...

180
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,850
...she said sara is still alive.

181
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,000
What did you see, linc?

182
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,530
What do you mean what did I see, michael?

183
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,000
I need you to tell me exactly what you saw.

184
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,930
Michael, sara's gone.

185
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,970
Well, you said

186
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,480
It was in a garage, right? so it was dark.

187
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,140
Yeah, it was dark.

188
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,750
But if you're asking me if I picked up the head

189
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,140
To check to see if it was sara, no, michael, i-i...

190
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,680
Lj said he...

191
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,760
He only heard them kill sara, right?

192
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,500
You just got to come back, please.

193
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,210
Come back. let's just...

194
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,970
Let's just start a new life.

195
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,110
Tell sofia I said hi.

196
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,420
And tell lj...

197
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,160
Tell him his uncle loves him.

198
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,080
Michael, don't do this, please.

199
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,780
Out, out!

200
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,640
You need some better ventilation back there, amigo.

201
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,180
Want to translate that?

202
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,110
Don't worry about it.

203
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,200
Gracias.

204
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,860
Where's your mom?

205
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,720
She'll be here.

206
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,910
What do you mean she'll be here?

207
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,210
We're-we're running out of time.

208
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,610
I got to be up there. don't worry.

209
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,030
My mom wouldn't let me down.

210
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,010
At least, she hasn't yet.

211
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
Bradley!

212
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,410
Over here!

213
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,970
Mom! mom! here!

214
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,670
I told you! don't worry, you'll make it there!

215
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,070
What is it called?

216
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,480
Europeangoldfinch.net.

217
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,930
Michael.

218
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,530
Don't worry, I'm alone.

219
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,830
It's good to see you.

220
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,290
So where's your new best friend?

221
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,190
I don't know about that,

222
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,810
But whistler's not who you think he is.

223
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,020
We're working together

224
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,280
Against the company.

225
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,410
Yeah? yeah.

226
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,080
And what about gretchen?

227
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,580
She working with you?

228
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,060
He needed her to further his plan.

229
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,380
Look, if the guy was company, he'd have shot you dead

230
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,060
Back at that conference like she wanted him to.

231
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,510
Do you have any information about sara or not?

232
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,040
Let's go somewhere a little more private.

233
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,730
I want you to tell me right now.

234
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,470
I want you to tell me right now, right here!

235
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,950
Or we can get gretchen on the phone.

236
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,170
Gretchen's dead.

237
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,860
She never showed up.

238
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,100
Come and talk to me, please.

239
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,800
Whistler and I were at that conference to get a data card.

240
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,150
It's like the company's black book.

241
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,120
And it lists all their agents, all their operations.

242
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,210
They refer to it as

243
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,950
"scylla."

244
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,250
Whistler's got it.

245
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,810
Alex, talk to me about sara.

246
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,040
That's all I care about.

247
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,550
I understand that. I want nothing more

248
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,420
Than to get home to my wife and my son.

249
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,330
But that's not gonna happen for either of us

250
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,950
With the company out there trying to kill us.

251
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,610
You don't know anything about sara, do you?

252
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,480
Whistler does.

253
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,650
He tells me he does.

254
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,440
And he wants to tell you.

255
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,840
But he wants something in return.

256
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,620
What? what does he want from me?

257
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,790
To talk to you.

258
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,860
I'm sorry about all that the other night.

259
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,690
If I had more time, I would've explained myself better.

260
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,580
Sure.

261
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,890
What are we doing here?

262
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,120
Alex told you about scylla? yes.

263
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,410
I have it.

264
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,450
There's one last step involved in order to read the data.

265
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,140
And that step involves breaking into a secured structure.

266
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
So now you need my help.

267
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,600
Yeah.

268
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,340
My book, the bird book, the one I lost

269
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,670
In sona contained information

270
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,330
That would've helped facilitate the break-in,

271
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,000
But it can still be accomplished,

272
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,750
With your help.

273
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,980
Where's sara?

274
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,480
The only thing I know for sure,

275
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,090
A week ago, some information

276
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,370
Came through the wire.

277
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,170
Sara may have bought a bus ticket in santa fe.

278
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,310
Headed where?

279
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,950
Chicago.

280
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,570
Michael, if sara's

281
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,380
Out there, she's not safe-- none of us are.

282
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,470
The company knows we still have

283
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,880
The original card, and that's why

284
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,260
Gretchen was the first to go.

285
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,390
I think we're done here.

286
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,630
We... have a chance for once

287
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,670
To get scylla to people that want to take the company down.

288
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,790
I don't want to run anymore. we won't have to run anymore.

289
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,340
I spent the last month thinking sara was dead

290
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,920
And that it was my fault.

291
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,990
If she's out there, I'm gonna find her.

292
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,540
That's all I care about.

293
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,900
This can be done within a week.

294
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,920
Less.

295
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,390
At least let me show you...

296
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,560
You kept your word to me.

297
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,350
You're the first that's ever done that. gracias.

298
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,030
Why must you go after this man?

299
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,990
You could choose not to.

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,110
Where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.

301
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,650
Comprende?

302
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,830
Yes.

303
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,360
Michael scofield left me for dead

304
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,370
One too many times, as it turns out.

305
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,390
What is spanish for "little angel"?

306
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,630
Angelita.

307
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,490
Adios,angelita.

308
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,210
Is this legit?

309
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,070
For the money you're paying, first class, all the way.

310
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,220
So these are coyotes one could trust.

311
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,510
Vamanos.

312
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,060
As you've seen,

313
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,570
What you're entering into is quite serious.

314
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,250
I realize that.

315
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,380
You're responsible for this now.

316
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,080
You have nothing to worry about.

317
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,290
We'll talk soon.

318
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,560
It's time to clean up now.

319
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,890
Thoroughly.

320
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,080
Everyone who was

321
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,380
Scofield,

322
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,910
Mahone, burrows.

323
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,900
Burrows is still in panama.

324
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,710
Clean up.

325
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,930
Hello.

326
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,500
Hi, pam.

327
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,410
Where...

328
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,840
Where are you?

329
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,530
Uh, you know.

330
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,560
In the middle of it, as usual.

331
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,440
Panama still?

332
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,300
No.

333
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,410
No.

334
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,770
Are you okay?

335
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,560
Definitely.

336
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,450
Are you?

337
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,370
Yes.

338
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,190
And cameron?

339
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,920
He's fine.

340
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,270
I have to tell you, pam, you know,

341
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,960
I had a plan for all of us to be together.

342
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,630
And...

343
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,310
I'm not gonna stop working on it.

344
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,640
Why do you need a plan if you want to be with someone?

345
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,180
You just be with them.

346
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,850
Don't say that unless you mean it.

347
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,420
'cause I'll turn this world upside down to get back to you.

348
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,130
So don't say it unless you mean it.

349
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,720
I mean it.

350
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,410
Okay.

351
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,700
Come on, babe.

352
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,130
I-i hate plantains, you know that.

353
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,810
I try your chili burger.

354
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,460
Chili-chili burger? you loved the chili burger.

355
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,830
Okay, I'm gonna

356
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,190
Make them with my mom's special recipe.

357
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,450
Your mom's special recipe?

358
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,520
You'll love it.

359
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,350
Really?

360
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,450
Yeah! you're gonna love it.

361
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,460
It's delicious.

362
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,450
Let's get out of here. drop 'em.

363
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,090
Let's go. give me your hand. lj.

364
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,200
????????Yeah, come with me.

365
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,450
Lincoln, what's going on?

366
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,100
Dad.

367
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,530
We're safe now.

368
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,860
Relax. no.

369
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,050
I saw someone.

370
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,060
Looks like company, I'm sure of it.

371
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,100
Let's just go, okay?

372
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,460
Let's go.

373
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,450
We'll-we'll be fine.

374
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,020
All right, all right. yeah.

375
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,120
Okay.

376
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,170
Let's go.

377
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,520
Get back.

378
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,480
Dad!

379
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,650
Dad, we have to run.

380
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,140
Go. get out of here.

381
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,610
Run!

382
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,170
I'm looking for alex.

383
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,960
I don't know where he is.

384
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,010
No?

385
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,020
No.

386
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,110
Uh, we've been divorced for almost two years now.

387
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,080
We haven't had contact in months.

388
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,180
I would think that might change now that he's back in the u.s.

389
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,640
I am so sick of you people-- what are you a fed?--

390
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,890
Thinking that you can keep on harassing...

391
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm not with the government, pam.

392
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,610
Mom, could you come here?

393
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,970
We're done talking...

394
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,160
Bruce bennett.

395
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,710
Do you know who this is?

396
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,460
I do.

397
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,750
I'm looking for sara, and right now,

398
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,910
You're the only person I can think of who can help me.

399
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,230
Hold on.

400
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,400
Where are you?

401
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,820
Back in chicago.

402
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,990
Have you heard from her?

403
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,130
Meet me in front of the drake hotel in a half hour.

404
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,250
Please just tell me... is she alive?

405
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,480
Are you michael scofield?

406
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,100
Are you michael scofield?

407
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,690
Yes, I am.

408
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,330
Hands on your head.

409
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,410
Michael scofield.

410
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,060
Special agent don self, homeland security.

411
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,160
Were you there when james whistler was killed?

412
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,750
I didn't kill him.

413
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,280
I know you didn't.

414
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,820
He was an independent contractor

415
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,130
Who worked for the company for about ten years.

416
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,870
He was assigned to retrieve scylla once it went missing.

417
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,580
Do you know what scylla is?

418
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,200
It's the company's little black book.

419
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,630
So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me.

420
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,000
What do you want from me?

421
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,370
You're looking at major time.

422
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,330
You know that, right?

423
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,800
So how would you like to walk away from it all...

424
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,750
Not do a day?

425
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,800
In exchange for...? scylla.

426
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,950
All right. sara tancredi, last seen in panama,

427
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,310
If you help me find her,

428
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,710
Maybe we've got a deal.

429
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,830
I'm sorry, she's not my department, scylla is.

430
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,340
Then go find it yourself.

431
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,540
It seems to me,

432
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,030
The u.s. government should have a little more reach

433
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,190
Than someone who's looking at major time.

434
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,560
To perform the operation, michael,

435
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,640
That would require signatures

436
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,960
From about 20 different department heads.

437
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,950
Do you want to bet at least one of them is company?

438
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,300
The only way this is going to work

439
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,630
Is via freelancer, off the books.

440
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,150
It sounds complicated.

441
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,600
I'll take a pass.

442
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail,

443
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,090
Not to mention the time that your brother's facing.

444
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,580
What are you talking about?

445
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,130
The company tried to take him out in panama.

446
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,290
He, um... reacted,

447
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,030
Apparently.

448
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,920
But I just made a deal

449
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,670
With the panamanian authorities

450
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,960
For him to serve out his time in the u.s.

451
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,720
He should be touching ground any time now.

452
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,740
You recognize this handwriting?

453
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,930
This is your father's.

454
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,930
He spent the last two years

455
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,910
Of his life going after this very thing.

456
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,680
Do you believe in fate, michael?

457
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,500
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.

458
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,530
Oh, no.

459
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,080
What's going...?

460
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,090
Stop! stop! hey! you don't want to go in there.

461
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,660
You don't want to go in there.

462
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,810
God, she's...

463
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,620
Lilah maria sucre.

464
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,490
She gave her my name?

465
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,290
Soy tu papa.

466
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,220
You're setting me up?

467
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,470
Sucre, you can't keep bringing maricruz down.

468
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,600
You can't do this to her anymore.

469
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,590
Wait. don't...

470
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,900
Sucre, don't...

471
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,910
Go! go!

472
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,290
Oh, boy.

473
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,460
We're screwed.

474
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,530
You know why scofield

475
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,540
Gets all twisted up when he's around me?

476
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,930
We're the same, and he just can't stand it.

477
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,080
Drives his ass crazy.

478
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,730
We got the same brilliant mind,

479
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,550
The same natural-born leader tendency,

480
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,990
The same one-in-a-million-type charisma, yes?

481
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,380
He just gonna look down his nose at me?

482
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,950
How you gonna find him?

483
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,090
This.

484
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,930
You're both into birds?

485
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,350
No, no.

486
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,930
It's either gonna take me to him, or he to me.

487
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,320
I just know it.

488
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,420
If I was you, I'd forget about this scofield.

489
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,650
You have plenty of money. see? I mean...

490
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,350
How much money you have in that bag?

491
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,290
Why don't you just mind your own beeswax, huh?

492
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,770
You just keep pointing

493
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,020
This jalopy northbound, all right?

494
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,310
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.

495
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,030
Of course.

496
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,510
Ready.

497
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,010
Only a few people in government will know of the operation.

498
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,230
It has to stay that way,

499
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,040
Or people's lives will be in danger, mine included.

500
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,710
Taking down the company sounds a little bigger

501
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,620
Than a two-man job, no?

502
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,750
I'm going to get you help.

503
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,440
I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody.

504
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,850
Yeah, but maybe you can.

505
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,790
All right, two of your cohorts--

506
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,930
Fernando sucre, and brad bellick were arrested,

507
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,150
They're both facing time,

508
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,490
And alexander mahone is in a colorado jail cell.

509
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,630
Good, let him sit there.

510
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,800
You're going to need mahone if you want to make this happen.

511
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,710
He was working with whistler.

512
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,040
And you'll have me.

513
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,080
Okay? whatever you need, I'll provide.

514
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,620
Whistler also said something about a second step,

515
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,190
Something about a break-in.

516
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,970
Yeah, the card has all the data on it,

517
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,310
But it's encrypted.

518
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,770
Once you get your hands on it,

519
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,110
You're going to need to find a way to break

520
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,440
Into the company's headquarters.

521
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,510
It's the only way to unlock what's on the card.

522
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,500
Where's the building?

523
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,410
L.a. where in l.a.?

524
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,230
I don't know.

525
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,450
So, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere,

526
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,100
And we've got to break into a building,

527
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,030
The location of which has yet to be determined.

528
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,200
Simple enough.

529
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,290
You've broken out of two penitentiaries.

530
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,260
I'm thinking, uh, breaking into a building

531
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,180
Isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.

532
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,540
How do you know our dad?

533
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,830
He heard from contacts that I could be trusted.

534
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,920
Your father was a good man.

535
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,990
Why now?

536
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,130
Look, I've been going after the company for five years.

537
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,510
Okay? when whistler was killed yesterday,

538
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,190
The plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation.

539
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,870
But, uh...

540
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,980
I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance.

541
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,990
So this is like job security for you?

542
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,430
What's that?

543
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,160
Well, when we go out there and risk our necks,

544
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:30,900
You can collect your pension.

545
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,210
No, no, no, lincoln.

546
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,080
Okay, some people still care about their job.

547
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,560
Some people still fight for this country.

548
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,150
Maybe you've been a little too distracted

549
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,590
Boosting car stereos and breaking heads

550
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,870
To remember that.

551
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,170
I don't know. if we do this deal,

552
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,410
After it's done,

553
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:58,580
You can look for sara... if she's alive.

554
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
If we take this deal, we'll both be dead

555
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,720
Long before I get the chance, linc.

556
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,290
You guys must have some big-time friends.

557
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,770
What are you talking about?

558
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,170
Somebody just posted

559
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,930
A significant amount of bail for both of you.

560
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,870
Who?

561
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,760
I don't know, but they're outside.

562
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,100
You're free to go.

563
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,810
Here, take your dad's file. my number's inside.

564
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,770
We ain't doing this. just take it anyway.

565
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,940
This file, it means nothing to me anymore.

566
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,040
Bruce bennett.

567
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,240
Let's go for a drive.

568
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,640
I thought I'd never see you again.

569
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,750
I have something for you.

570
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,450
Okay.

571
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,010
You left this behind.

572
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,050
Is that what this is about?

573
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,210
You just getting me my rose back?

574
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,710
Yeah. I guess I'm done now.

575
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,880
I can retire.

576
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
How much time are you looking at?

577
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,600
They're saying 15 years.

578
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,680
I have to find out for sure.

579
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,800
I heard lincoln say something about a deal.

580
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,640
No jail time.

581
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,850
In exchange for taking down the company.

582
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,740
How?

583
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,620
Exactly.

584
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,900
I love you.

585
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,590
That's all I know right now.

586
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,110
"will you not yield to the immortal gods?"

587
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,700
"that nightmare cannot die.

588
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,290
"eternal evil itself.

589
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,190
"there is no fighting her, no.

590
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,470
No power that can fight her."

591
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,620
Now, listen to me-- it's up to you now.

592
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,070
"all that avails is flight."

593
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,730
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

594
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,370
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,320
Do you want to talk about it?

596
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,540
It's not your fault.

597
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,820
It's not.

598
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,440
Tell me what happened.

599
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,510
It's just the company.

600
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,740
It's just what they do.

601
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,300
It wasn't just me.

602
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,150
God, it was you and lj and-and

603
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,330
Lincoln.

604
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,890
And they won't stop,

605
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,420
And I don't know how to deal with that.

606
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,450
Hey, come here.

607
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,090
Come here. come here.

608
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,210
Let's go!

609
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,290
Are you okay?

610
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,220
I can't believe they found us so fast.

611
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,110
Should I call... should I call bruce

612
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,580
And-and get some place safe?

613
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,250
No place is safe.

614
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,780
They're not gonna stop unless we stop them. linc?

615
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,340
You thinking what I'm thinking? let's end this.

616
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,130
But I'm not gonna leave you behind again.

617
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,180
Yeah?

618
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,750
Hey

619
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,910
Hey, papi.

620
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,210
Linc.

621
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,700
I can't tell you how grateful I am for you including me.

622
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,700
Well, sucre vouched for you, bellick.

623
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,310
He said you came through

624
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,480
For him down in panama.

625
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,740
Alex?

626
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,690
Michael.

627
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,600
You ready for this?

628
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,630
Yeah. I am.

629
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,580
So I hear whistler's bird book

630
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,390
Has details about what we need to steal.

631
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,280
Yeah.

632
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,830
You know who's got it, right?

633
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,180
Please.

634
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,030
We'll die out here.

635
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,560
Thanks for the cash, gringo.

636
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,310
First class all the way.

637
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,820
Do we have any idea where t-bag is?

638
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,520
That snake could be anywhere.

639
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,480
When we're in l.a., we can think like convicts,

640
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,990
We just can't act like them.

641
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,550
If we do, we're done.

642
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,520
It goes without saying--

643
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,900
This is your last chance to back out,

644
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,150
'cause first on the list of things

645
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,530
I cannot guarantee you is your safety.

646
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,390
We're all a long way

647
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,000
From where this started.

648
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,760
But what I can guarantee you

649
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,720
Is that if we do this thing right,

650
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,830
We'll be close to where it ends.

651
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,180
Freedom.

652
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,370
Finally.

653
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,390
You two-- let's go.

654
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,660
Hey, mike?

655
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,020
What about sara?

656
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,760
Sara's in.

657
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,500
All right, we're heading out tomorrow.

658
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,950
I have to finalize a few things before we go.

659
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,080
No games and no stunts.

660
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,390
Otherwise, I promise,

661
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,540
You're gonna see a whole different side of me.

662
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,980
Likewise.

663
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,800
Fake ids.

664
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,470
It's a good start,

665
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,270
But there are some things you can't fake,

666
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,140
And there are some things

667
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,500
You can't hide.

668
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,900
Know what I mean?

669
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,930
How high is your threshold for pain?

670
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,840
You sure you don't want a sedative?

671
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,790
We're gonna go into the night.

672
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,820
How do you feel?

673
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,440
Lighter somehow.

674
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,200
Look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down.

675
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,310
I don't even know who they are,

676
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,880
But I do know one thing--

677
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,000
The company's gonna pay for what they did to you.

678
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,890
Let's go.

679
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,790
You sure you're up for this?

680
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,420
If we can

681
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,150
Do it together, um... yeah.

682
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,260
Absolutely.

683
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,240
A c-130? what do they want...

684
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,110
Want us to parachute out of this thing?

685
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,990
This guy called in a favor to the air force.

686
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,620
It's not like we can be flying commercial, you know?

687
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,350
If you're successful with obtaining scylla,

688
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,770
You'll not only avoid jail time, but you can take great pride

689
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,100
In knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat

690
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,770
To its own democracy.

691
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,940
If you're killed while doing so,

692
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,200
A proper funeral will be provided.

693
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,680
But if you try to escape,

694
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,500
You will have no funeral.

695
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,970
You will have nothing,

696
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,720
And you will be apprehended and buried where

697
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,430
We find you.

698
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,430
I sincerely hope we understand each other.

699
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,580
You better hold up your end of the deal.

700
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,420
Let's go!
