1
00:00:00,446 --> 00:00:02,160
<i>Previously, on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:03,675
I got nothing against you, kid.

3
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:04,861
What are you doing, man?

4
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:05,965
But they do.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,103
Your pal Manche told me all
about your little treasure hunt

6
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:13,955
for Westmoreland's stash.

7
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:15,286
We're going to Utah.

8
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:16,748
Fooled you.

9
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:18,914
Put your hands behind your back.

10
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:21,333
- Make yourself at home.
- Sure.

11
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,790
Your father got a call
from the white house.

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,180
They withdrew his nomination.

13
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,055
According to them, his confirmation
was going to be a problem.

14
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:33,855
My father is not a suicidal man.

15
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:36,358
<i>Governor Tancredi, not part of our plan.</i>

16
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:38,559
<i>Anyone who knows anything
has got to be dealt with.</i>

17
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,300
<i>If someone's a liability, they go.</i>

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,873
<i>Tancredi was becoming a liability.</i>

19
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:43,185
So was his daughter.

20
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:44,616
Wait, what?

21
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:48,454
<i>Burrows is scheduled to be released</i>

22
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,874
<i>from the Klipton detention center
in Kingman, Arizona tomorrow morning.</i>

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,993
LJ is out there; I'm going to get him.

24
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,644
Take care.

25
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,266
Charles Westmoreland...

26
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,711
god bless you
and your wrinkled old sack.

27
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:05,968
It's all here.

28
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:07,330
Where's Sucre?

29
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:08,672
Drop the bag.

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,873
No one's going anywhere.

31
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,930
What the hell are you doing, man?

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,972
Sucre...

33
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,125
- whatever it is you want...
- I want the money,

34
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:29,159
- I want the money, all of it.
- What,

35
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,422
are you robbing us?

36
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,118
The money was never yours to begin with.

37
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,160
This is about business.

38
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:36,324
$5 million worth of business.

39
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:38,293
So this is how
it's going to go down, huh?

40
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,490
After everything.

41
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,930
Once a thief, always a thief.

42
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,338
You just figuring that out?

43
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:48,880
The backpack.

44
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,350
Now!

45
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,785
Don't do this, buddy.

46
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,550
Yo, take a look around you, Papi.

47
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:02,102
It's three of us,

48
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,132
it's one of you;
you are outnumbered, man,

49
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:05,487
and we will come after you.

50
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:07,237
It'll be the last thing you do,
my brother.

51
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,963
What, are you going to shoot
at all of us?

52
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,047
Probably not.

53
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,924
But I will get two.

54
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,859
Now...

55
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:18,866
which two is it going to be?

56
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,681
That's what I thought.

57
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,322
Adios, amigos.

58
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:34,450
I don't believe this.

59
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,400
We have come all this way

60
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:39,329
and done all of this work.

61
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:41,510
Thought you was compadres, Tattoo?

62
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:46,394
So what are we going to do now, man?

63
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,508
The police are going
to be here any second.

64
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:49,950
Ain't no way I'm letting that--

65
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:52,830
that dunderpate ride off with five...!

66
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:54,038
It's your choice.

67
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,070
It's all right.

68
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:12,741
I'm going to give you this, and...

69
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:16,891
you should be able to cut yourself free
in about an hour.

70
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:20,207
So what's the plan, man?

71
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,943
Well, you can do what you want.

72
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,182
I let that psychopath T-Bag loose once.

73
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,267
I'm not going to do it again.

74
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:29,017
Make a nice little present
for the police when they get here.

75
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:36,203
Where is he?

76
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,426
I don't know, man, look,
I got to, I got to go.

77
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:47,863
Good luck.

78
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,174
They're going to get you.

79
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:19,802
Ms. Tancredi.

80
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:21,301
I didn't mean to startle you.

81
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,954
What the hell are you doing in my house?

82
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:25,891
No reason to be frightened.
I used to work with your father.

83
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,989
I'm so sorry for your loss.

84
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:40,639
My father didn't commit suicide.

85
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:45,632
What are you doing?

86
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,718
Making sure it doesn't look like I did!

87
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:50,771
People will ask questions if the day
the governor was found killing himself,

88
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,840
his daughter is found dead
in what looks like a struggle.

89
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,823
Well, then.

90
00:04:58,736 --> 00:04:59,996
What if they don't find her?

91
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:03,259
In an apparent attempt
to avoid jail time,

92
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:07,376
the governor's daughter
skips bail and disappears.

93
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,741
We're talking about your last minutes,
Ms. Tancredi.

94
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,926
- Please, don't do this.
- That stuff on that table is premium.

95
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,958
It's grade "A."

96
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,695
Do yourself a favor, go out on a high.

97
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,441
Look, I'm begging you here.

98
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
One last ride.

99
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,206
Oh, god!

100
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,401
Adios, amigos, huh?

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,005
What? Too much?

102
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,946
You were great.

103
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,187
This thing is freaking heavy, dude.

104
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,743
Won't be so bad after we split it up.

105
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,852
Three ways: Me, you and Linc.

106
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,029
Four.

107
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,961
We're going to send
a share to Charles's daughter,

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,277
with her father's love,
just like we promised.

109
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:52,493
What about C-Note?

110
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,659
I feel kind of bad
about the whole thing.

111
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,470
There's no way
to know if we could trust him.

112
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,007
Once we get to Panama,
we'll send something up to his family,

113
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,353
make sure he's taken care of.

114
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,810
Five million dollars.

115
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,006
I can't believe I'm going to be...

116
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:10,331
Where the hell is the money?

117
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,298
Where the hell is the money?

118
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:45,543
The backpack... now!

119
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,585
Here we go, watch your head.

120
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:53,767
Mr. Burrows?

121
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:56,175
Merry christmas from the state.

122
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,786
Here's a list of options
available to you.

123
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:00,946
Places to stay,

124
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,226
businesses that are more open

125
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:04,238
to hiring men out of
the correctional system.

126
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,294
Any questions you might have
about your immediate future?

127
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,392
No.

128
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,694
Well, the number on there is toll-free.

129
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:31,406
If you encounter any problems,
you can call there 24-7.

130
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:32,506
Thanks.

131
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:33,739
Wait a second.

132
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:34,800
You know what?

133
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,623
Why don't you tell me
where you need to go,

134
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,350
and I'll make sure you get there.

135
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,702
You know, I think I'll be all right.

136
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,651
- You sure?
- Yeah. Thank you.

137
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,615
Kid didn't bite.

138
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,062
He's on foot.

139
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,019
<i>All right.</i>

140
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,000
Have your men follow.
Remember, it's the father we want.

141
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:08,454
We can't go back.

142
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,776
You said it, without the money,
we're screwed.

143
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,412
- We can't...
- just let me think.

144
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,230
- Maybe it's still back...
- Just let me think!

145
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,819
Maybe it's still back at the house.

146
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,616
The money's not back
at the house unless T-Bag is.

147
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,549
He must've switched the packs.

148
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:25,598
What do we do...

149
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:26,981
what do we do now?

150
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,270
We still got the five grand
we took when we pocketed the money.

151
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:33,698
It's not gonna be five million,

152
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,488
but it might be enough
to get us where we're going.

153
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:37,894
<i>All units be advised.</i>

154
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,077
<i>Escaped convicts from Fox River</i>

155
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:43,928
<i>have been positively id'd
at 1131 Monterey lane.</i>

156
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:46,102
<i>We have dogs being dispatched
to the location.</i>

157
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,605
<i>I want every road
in or out of town blocked off.</i>

158
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,539
I don't care if it's on wheels,
rails or hooves.

159
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,262
I want it stopped and searched.

160
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:56,569
I thought you said
we would have a head start.

161
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,855
It was the gunshot, buddy.

162
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,800
One of the neighbors must've heard.

163
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:01,479
How fast can that thing go?

164
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,008
I don't know.
Both of us, it could probably...

165
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,386
We're never gonna get out of here
on the roads.

166
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:12,787
We need to find another way.

167
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:19,280
He's in your office.

168
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,626
I can't believe
they're calling me back here

169
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:24,885
when my escapees are out there.

170
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:26,323
I want to know who this guy is.

171
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:27,768
Said his name was Sullins.

172
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:30,947
Son of a bitch.

173
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,123
Let me know if anything breaks
on the convicts.

174
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:40,885
Alex. Thanks for coming in.

175
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:43,688
You want to tell me why internal affairs
is pulling me out of the field

176
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:44,884
in the middle of a manhunt?

177
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,323
It's been a while
since we've had a sit-down, hasn't it?

178
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,504
Not since the shales escape, am I right?

179
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,821
What's going on, Richard?

180
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:51,822
Well...

181
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:54,336
that's precisely
what I'm here to find out.

182
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,565
And you're not getting out of here
until I do.

183
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:24,652
What can I get for you boys?

184
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:27,535
You tell me.

185
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:29,662
Two waters, then.

186
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:32,098
And the use of your phone,
if you'd be so kind.

187
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,220
Don't worry, it's a local call.

188
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:42,117
First thing I do, we get home:
Clean underwear.

189
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:43,287
Then what?

190
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:46,253
I guess go back to that liquor store,
beg for my job back.

191
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,035
We had it.

192
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:53,683
We were so close.

193
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,611
I can still taste that money right there
in the back of my throat.

194
00:12:57,663 --> 00:13:00,008
Well, nothing that
a couple of keystones,

195
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:02,338
a hungry man salisbury steak dinner

196
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,922
and a night in front of the tv
won't take care of.

197
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,376
Hey, mom, it's Brad.

198
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:14,247
Hey, listen, me and Roy,
we ran into some car trouble and...

199
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:17,876
we were wondering
if you could come pick us up.

200
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:19,557
I don't know, hold on.

201
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,098
What the hell town is this?

202
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:23,626
Thought you said this was a local call.

203
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,472
Hey, Bradley, check this out.

204
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,473
Wait, mom.

205
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:28,788
<i>...these individuals
were reportedly the prisoners</i>

206
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:32,496
<i>who escaped from the Fox River
penitentiary in Illinois</i>

207
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,912
<i>just a couple of days ago.</i>

208
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,909
<i>What were they doing
all the way out here in Tooele, Utah?</i>

209
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,348
<i>Well, Jeanette Owens, whose garage
they dug up, has her own theory.</i>

210
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:46,981
<i>They pretended that they were some kind
of workers from the power company,</i>

211
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:52,492
<i>and that they had made a mistake
and they'd have to do some digging.</i>

212
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,840
Hey, mom, on second thought,

213
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:56,838
can you wire us some extra scratch?

214
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,271
Turns out, we ain't done yet.

215
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:17,840
Bruce, I need your help.

216
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,508
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide,
okay?

217
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,621
Okay, just calm down. Where are you?

218
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,194
<i>He was looking
into the Burrows case</i>

219
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,991
and I think that he found something
that they didn't want him to know.

220
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,132
And now, I think
that they think that I know it, too.

221
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,632
<i>All right,
I want you to listen to me.</i>

222
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,363
I'm gonna send someone over
to pick you up.

223
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,677
I'll bring you back here,
and we'll sort all of this out,

224
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:37,912
I promise. Just tell me where you are.

225
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,133
I don't know, I'm at a pay phone on...

226
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:42,884
Third and Harper.

227
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,076
Do you have your cell
in case I need to reach you?

228
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:47,194
I do, but I thought it would be tapped.

229
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,891
- I don't know.
- All right, someone's on their way.

230
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,361
Just stay right where you are.

231
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:52,819
Thank you.

232
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,579
I'll give you 80 bucks for them.

233
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:07,895
Come on, man, they're worth...

234
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,505
worth a lot more
to the person they actually belong to.

235
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,228
These are ladies clubs, doctor.

236
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,070
I'm guessing they're hotter
than a monkey's jockstrap.

237
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:17,230
80 bucks.

238
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:23,538
Throw in the cooler, and you got a deal.

239
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,504
We got to lose the bike.

240
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,513
Uh-uh. No way.

241
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:34,433
The roads are sealed. It's the only way
we're gonna make it out of here.

242
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:35,996
I can't, bro. I promised Petey...

243
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:38,194
you're not getting
that thing across the river.

244
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:41,819
And every minute we spend trying
is a minute we don't have, okay?

245
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,879
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:44,631
We got to move.

247
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,567
I've heard about these kinds of places.

248
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:59,068
They got leeches, you know.

249
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,818
I'll take the leeches in here
over the handcuffs back there.

250
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:03,966
I don't know, Papi.

251
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:05,963
Sort of depends
on where the leech leeches,

252
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:08,210
- you know what I'm saying?
- Stop kidding around.

253
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,192
Are you all right, buddy?

254
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,780
I can't... I can't move!

255
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,999
You feel like you broke anything?

256
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,261
No, I don't think so.

257
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,414
Can you get it?

258
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:31,637
Can you get it off me?

259
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:41,190
This thing's not going anywhere.

260
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:42,922
I'm gonna check your foot.

261
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:00,664
I'm sorry, buddy.

262
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,290
It's stuck.

263
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:41,415
You, call 911.

264
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:48,691
Kelli, my name is Sara. I'm a doctor.

265
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,883
You're gonna be okay. Can you hear me?

266
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:53,350
You'll be all right.
Take some deep breaths and...

267
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:10,242
It's gonna be okay, right?

268
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:13,760
I mean, if you can get
eight people out of prison,

269
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,564
you can get my puerto rican ass
out of this, right?

270
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,108
Can't you?

271
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,060
Come on!

272
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,376
Damn it!

273
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,752
Do you hear that?

274
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:50,692
I know that sound.

275
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:52,966
There's a dam up river.

276
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:56,878
It's a signal.

277
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,197
It means they're opening the locks.

278
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:02,316
That means the water level's gonna rise,

279
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,938
and when it does,
the log will just float right off.

280
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,066
Yeah?

281
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,624
<i>Canine units at the scene
have multiple scents</i>

282
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,377
and are spreading out into the field.

283
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,489
These guys can't have gotten very far.

284
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:17,607
There were six cons back at that house.

285
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:20,211
They'll be tracking us
in every direction.

286
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:22,383
It'll take an hour
just to make it over this far,

287
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,503
and by that time,
the water level will rise,

288
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:25,687
we'll be long gone.

289
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:26,816
Are you sure?

290
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,068
Yeah, I'm sure.

291
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:33,565
I'm sure.

292
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:36,989
Ask any of the 20 cops there,

293
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:38,343
John Abruzzi was armed.

294
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,813
John Abruzzi drew his weapon...

295
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:41,816
he never should have been allowed
to get that far.

296
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,127
Richard, let's be clear.

297
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:44,816
If you knew how things
needed to be handled

298
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,001
in a manhunt,
you'd be out there running one

299
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:50,146
instead of hamstringing
the men that are.

300
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,366
The FBI's primary objective
in investigating fugitive matters

301
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:57,078
is to affect the swift location
and capture of the fugitives.

302
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:59,099
You have two dead bodies, Alex.

303
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,081
I've got two dead felons, Richard.

304
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:04,087
Now, maybe that doesn't play well
from a public relations standpoint,

305
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:05,862
but from a public safety standpoint,

306
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,511
Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.

307
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:12,315
Shooting of an unarmed kid
at point-blank range is by the book?

308
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,753
Come on.

309
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:15,818
Incident report,

310
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:18,225
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

311
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,783
You know, I'm curious,
was he cuffed during transport?

312
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:26,001
Says in here he somehow managed
to grab your primary weapon.

313
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:28,057
You carry that in a shoulder holster?

314
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,441
- Hip.
- Left, right? Right, left?

315
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:32,411
- Left.
- Left.

316
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,956
I'm sorry, I get confused sometimes.

317
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,192
So just so I've got this right,

318
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,799
you were driving along
alone with a cuffed prisoner,

319
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:48,257
and somehow he reaches forward
across your chest and grabs your weapon.

320
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,481
It's too bad you didn't react
that quickly with Apolskis.

321
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,759
Maybe he'd still be alive.

322
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:41,341
What does an origami bird
have to do with any of this?

323
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,156
Michael Scofield sent it to her.

324
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:45,065
And since your brilliant plan

325
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:47,510
to eliminate Sara Tancredi
from the equation

326
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,626
failed so completely...

327
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,352
I wouldn't say
it failed completely at all.

328
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:51,989
There's a dead woman in a phone booth.

329
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:55,317
Civilian.

330
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,370
A certain number of bodies
you can sweep under the rug.

331
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,396
President's rug is getting so full,
you can hardly stand on it.

332
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,565
So what do you suggest we should do?

333
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,744
You ever go fishing, Bill?

334
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:10,044
Just make your point.

335
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,501
There's two ways to catch a fish.

336
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,751
You cast out a big net and hope
you get what you're looking for.

337
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:18,498
Or you choose the right bait
and guarantee that you do.

338
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:21,253
It's a simple strategy,
plays across the board.

339
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,754
LJ will lead us to Burrows.

340
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:24,921
Sara will lead us to Scofield.

341
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:27,066
And how do you intend to follow Sara,

342
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,503
when the only lead you've got is an

343
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:31,099
origami bird with an
out of service phone number?

344
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:33,942
Maybe it's not a phone number.

345
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:51,949
What do you have?

346
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:54,450
Junior's on the move,
but still no sign of Burrows.

347
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:57,640
Sir, the guy's in hiding, maybe
he doesn't even know his kid's out.

348
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:00,887
The cop that was held hostage in Utah
has Burrows splitting off

349
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,000
from the rest of the group
just after word

350
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:04,501
of LJ's release hit the wire.

351
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:06,262
<i>He knows.</i>

352
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,945
Now if we want to know
for sure if he's there,

353
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,641
we need to do something to draw him out.

354
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:30,958
Hey, you mind sparing some change?

355
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:32,263
No.

356
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:33,361
Come on.

357
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,758
No, I'm all tapped out.

358
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:37,075
You got something.
I'll take whatever you got.

359
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:39,314
Look, seriously,
I just got out of lock-up.

360
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,507
I would if I could.

361
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:46,513
Sorry.

362
00:23:46,515 --> 00:23:48,959
I see, you think
you're better than me, huh?

363
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,795
I don't think I'm better than you.

364
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:52,587
Yo, where you running, little man?

365
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:54,738
I'm not running anywhere.

366
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,070
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

367
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:09,625
The whole reason
I went along with the break

368
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:12,013
was to have a life
with Maricruz and my baby.

369
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:15,076
And now what?

370
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,995
Get some two-bit job?

371
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:20,082
Always be looking over my shoulder?

372
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:23,459
What kind of life is that?

373
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,575
You can come with me and Linc.

374
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,639
To Panama.

375
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:29,012
Start over.

376
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,389
The longer you stay here,

377
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,168
the more chance there
is you'll never make it to Panama.

378
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:35,340
You've got other people to think about.

379
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,249
Your brother, your nephew.

380
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:39,078
Sara.

381
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:41,763
She's meeting you down there, isn't she?

382
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:42,764
I don't know.

383
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:45,026
We never talked about it.

384
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:47,415
- But you're hoping.
- Just give it a rest, will you.

385
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:49,672
The dogs are locked in.
We've got two trails merging.

386
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:50,762
They were definitely here.

387
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:53,376
They've headed east towards
Drucker ranch. They've gone off-road.

388
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:54,408
Any additional units,

389
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:57,504
<i>we need to setup a one-mile perimeter
and then start closing in.</i>

390
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,181
It's getting deeper.

391
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:06,361
So how come this freaking thing
ain't moving yet?

392
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:09,822
Let me check.

393
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,820
You all right?

394
00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:24,702
Look, Michael...

395
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,501
I understand
if you have to keep going, you know.

396
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,259
Don't say that. I'm not going anywhere.

397
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,697
No, but, look, just think about it.

398
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:31,945
You know, if I leave you drown.

399
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,223
No, I know, but just...

400
00:25:33,383 --> 00:25:35,510
the water level's getting higher, Sucre.

401
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,329
How many seconds
can you hold your breath?

402
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:38,669
45? 60?

403
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:41,321
That's how long
you've got to live if I take off.

404
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:42,938
How long do you have if you stay?

405
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,696
How long till the dogs
lead the cops here?

406
00:25:44,697 --> 00:25:46,392
What you're suggesting is not an option.

407
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,633
Look,
I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.

408
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:51,911
We both know there are only
two things that can happen now.

409
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,259
Lee me here...

410
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:58,081
or we both get caught.

411
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:21,759
I know we said not to use this number,
but I just needed to know you were okay.

412
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:24,813
My driver said he went to pick you up
and the place was a crime scene.

413
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,197
Yeah, the woman that he saw,
the woman by the pay phone,

414
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:28,509
that was supposed to be me.

415
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,015
<i>And I had to leave her there.
I didn't know what to do.</i>

416
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:32,264
Who are these people?

417
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:34,400
They knew exactly
where I was going to be standing.

418
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,010
They knew where I was going to be...

419
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:39,714
- Are you there?
- It was you.

420
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,783
What are you talking about?

421
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,260
- I just need to know where you are.
- Oh, my god.

422
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:15,576
Excuse me, we'd like to check
on a friend of ours, LJ Burrows?

423
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:17,073
He's getting some stitches.

424
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:18,689
We just want
to make sure he's all right.

425
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:20,275
And you can see him when he's through.

426
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:21,374
It's policy.

427
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,134
You don't get it.
I get that that kid defended himself.

428
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:25,886
You going to tell us
why you attacked him...

429
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,846
- I told you man.
- I know, some guy paid you.

430
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:29,697
Excuse me. FBI.

431
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:31,897
What do you mean somebody paid you?

432
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,557
What the hell does it sound like, man?

433
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:36,274
Some dude gave me 50 bucks
to give the kid a beat down.

434
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:39,887
It's Burrows. He's here.

435
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:47,614
How you feeling, son?

436
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,510
Dad?

437
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,510
We got to move.

438
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,845
Excuse me, ladies.
I need to ask you a few questions.

439
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:20,253
I'm on the,
follow-up investigation team.

440
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:21,628
Excuse me.

441
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,153
We're just curious.

442
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,876
Did you see if
the convicts actually found

443
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:30,586
what they were digging for?

444
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:32,747
No. But sure sounded like they did.

445
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:36,314
The spaniard, he took off with one
of my daughter's camping packs

446
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,314
and he left
the other ones in a real tizzy.

447
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:40,815
Sounded like he screwed
'em over something fierce.

448
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:42,418
And they just let him leave?

449
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,190
Well, they weren't
happy about it, but, yeah.

450
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:46,939
He took off on his motorbike,

451
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,501
and then they left a few minutes later.

452
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:49,877
- Together?
- No.

453
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:52,363
The pretty one and the black fellow,
they left first,

454
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,802
and then that dirty southerner...

455
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:55,025
he snuck out the back.

456
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:56,788
But he was moving kind of slow,

457
00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:00,101
you know, the weight of that backpack
and that disability that...

458
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,601
wait a minute, he had a backpack, too?

459
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:02,602
Yes.

460
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:06,948
He came back in and slipped this
into my brassiere on his way out.

461
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:09,477
He said it was to cover the damages.

462
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:17,010
We're going to need
to keep this as evidence.

463
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:19,370
Thank you for your time.

464
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:31,901
Seven, three, six, space.

465
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,773
Three, three, nine, space.

466
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,463
Eight, six, eight, seven.

467
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,311
And what exactly are you looking for?

468
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:41,993
A pattern. A code.

469
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Anything.

470
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,484
What? What are you trying
to tell me, Michael?

471
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:18,700
They say...

472
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:21,609
people come into your life for a reason.

473
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:27,702
Maybe my reason
was to help you get out of Fox River.

474
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:31,733
You know, to help you save your brother.

475
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:33,011
No.

476
00:30:40,512 --> 00:30:41,745
It's okay, Papi.

477
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:44,888
Let me go.

478
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:48,982
We're a quarter mile up
the river below the dam.

479
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:54,106
- It's now or never, Michael.
<i>- They're close.</i>

480
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:00,451
I want you to hold your breath. Okay?

481
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,012
- Why?
- Just do it.

482
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:03,679
I'll be right back, I promise.

483
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:25,693
What the hell are you doing?

484
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:28,484
<i>Redirect all units to the river.</i>

485
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:29,788
I want you to go under.

486
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:32,478
And then stick your arm up,
above the water, high.

487
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:33,521
All right.

488
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,522
And then
when you start running out of air,

489
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:38,208
wave it back and forth so I can see it.

490
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:39,770
And I'll come back and get you.

491
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:41,715
Okay? All right, give me your hand.

492
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,770
One...

493
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,271
two...

494
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:47,585
three.

495
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:49,103
- Talk to me.
- Well,

496
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,648
there is one possibility,

497
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:52,569
but it's almost too rudimentary.

498
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:54,693
We know
we're not looking at a phone number,

499
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:57,021
but maybe
we're not looking at numbers at all.

500
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,461
<i>What's important are the letters
that correspond to that number.</i>

501
00:34:08,154 --> 00:34:09,900
Three dots, third letter

502
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:15,178
Two... "D," "E."

503
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,796
<i>Three possibilities per number.</i>

504
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:20,019
<i>That's thousands
of letter combinations.</i>

505
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:25,566
But only one of them spells out a word.

506
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:36,123
She was right.

507
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:52,480
- What are you in the market for?
- Four wheels and a gas pedal.

508
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:55,507
Hey, Petey. Uh, it's me.

509
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:58,785
Listen, I got something to tell you.

510
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:00,803
Yeah, I was wondering
when you were gonna call.

511
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:01,986
Yeah,

512
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,598
a lot has come down
since we last talked, and...

513
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:07,536
<i>Gee, I know, I heard.</i>

514
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:09,091
<i>You ruined it.</i>

515
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:10,694
Yeah,

516
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:12,903
you heard already?

517
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,814
Well, brother, everybody's heard, man,

518
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,356
and let me tell you something, man.

519
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:18,322
<i>Hector is pissed.</i>

520
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:19,809
What does hector have to do with it?

521
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,213
It was his wedding.

522
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:23,331
Wait, man. What are you talking about?

523
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,157
Your bike. What are you talking about?

524
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:26,156
The wedding.

525
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,434
<i>What about the wedding?</i>

526
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:30,222
<i>Well, you know the part where,
uh, you say, "I do"?</i>

527
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,480
Maricruz said, "I don't."

528
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:35,906
She did?

529
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:39,795
<i>Left homeboy standing at the altar
holding his spam in his hand,</i>

530
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:41,647
<i>if you know what I'm saying.</i>

531
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:44,319
What were you telling me about my bike?

532
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:49,716
All right.

533
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,004
I'll go get your keys.

534
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:53,652
I got a coup stops to make.

535
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,048
First is this place called Blanding.

536
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,025
Then we'll meet up
with Lincoln in a couple days.

537
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:58,557
I can't go.

538
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,336
She said no, Papi.

539
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:05,188
Maricruz...
Maricruz told that son of A...

540
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,532
she told him no. Can you believe that?

541
00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:09,489
- That's great.
- I know.

542
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:11,554
Now,

543
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:12,804
I just...

544
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:14,843
No. Go on.

545
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,094
- Get your girl.
- What about Panama?

546
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:18,682
- We said that...
- Some other time.

547
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,378
Panama's not going to go anywhere.

548
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:26,706
This is, uh, in case you run
into trouble down the road.

549
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:33,931
In the river...

550
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:36,971
I told you to leave me behind.

551
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,289
Yeah, well, I tried, but...

552
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,467
then I got tangled up in the rope, so...

553
00:36:46,311 --> 00:36:47,989
Okay, here you go.

554
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,748
Thanks, and...

555
00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:53,491
we'll need another car.

556
00:36:59,736 --> 00:37:02,624
Do you really think
the diaper sniper got all of it?

557
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:04,435
Only one way to find out.

558
00:37:04,548 --> 00:37:07,669
If you were Bagwell, and you just got
your hands on $5 million,

559
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,915
where would you go?

560
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,343
You think you're the only one
who feels betrayed?

561
00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:41,731
I'm gonna get out of here some day.

562
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:42,986
And when I do,

563
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:48,230
don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

564
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:05,596
Let me get this straight.

565
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:08,041
You paid that meth-head to whoop my ass?

566
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,887
Feds were waiting for me
to come get you. It was the only way.

567
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:13,899
- It worked, didn't it?
- Yeah.

568
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,566
Yeah, it got me four stitches.

569
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:18,202
Adds character.

570
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,784
Here, take that.

571
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,775
There's some ice in there.
Put it on the eye.

572
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:23,803
Keep the swelling down.

573
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:29,256
I've been in
a few fights in my day, too.

574
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,228
Too many.

575
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:03,826
There's one more bird.

576
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:15,492
Clean it.

577
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:17,715
Every surface, like she never came home.

578
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,402
You know,
I wait for your flight from Utah,

579
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:48,547
I had a little extra time
for due diligence,

580
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:51,134
so I decided to dig
a little deeper on your history,

581
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:52,568
or rather lack of one.

582
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:55,250
Starts off simple enough. Poor family.

583
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,140
Mom leaves, cites spousal abuse.

584
00:39:57,198 --> 00:39:59,001
Somehow your dad holds onto custody,

585
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:01,117
and by the look of these pediatric meds,

586
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:03,770
he beats you like a harp seal
for the next four years.

587
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,692
Big shock... poor, abused kid,

588
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,751
not a lot of options...
he joins the military.

589
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:10,743
Will there be any actual questions,
or is this just a show-and-tell?

590
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:11,903
Okay, I got one.

591
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:14,846
How does a guy go from infantry grunt
with less than stellar marks

592
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,522
to the gulf 1, special ops,

593
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:19,337
to the Federal Bureau of Investigations,

594
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,982
leading the largest manhunt
this country's ever seen?

595
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:24,855
I have all these dots.

596
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,979
And there's just no way to connect them.

597
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:31,549
Looks like you need to work
on your clearance level... Dick.

598
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:32,942
Or maybe I just work on you.

599
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:35,194
- You want to do this?
- I will chain you to this desk

600
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:37,887
until I get some answers
I cannot fertilize my lawn with.

601
00:40:37,945 --> 00:40:39,180
You sure you want to do this?

602
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:42,035
I know what they tell you
to do overseas, Alex,

603
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:44,249
and let me make it perfectly clear...

604
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:46,524
we do not do it on american soil.

605
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:49,195
Sir, there's a phone call for you.

606
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:50,475
I'll take it later.

607
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,077
Sir, you're gonna want to take this now.

608
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:00,633
Yeah.

609
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:02,196
Yes, Sir.

610
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:04,382
I...

611
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,759
I'm with him now.

612
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,508
Yes, sir.

613
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:16,730
Where you going?

614
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,722
I thought we were really starting
to get somewhere.

615
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:23,194
Let's go.

616
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:40,259
Alex.

617
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,712
You got something for me?

618
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,714
Open it.

619
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,842
The numbers correlate
to the letters on a phone.

620
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:58,593
Only on this one, none
of the possible combinations make sense.

621
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,615
We think it's a location,

622
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:01,276
a rendez-vous point
for Michael Scofield.

623
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,890
You find it, you find him.

624
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:06,586
You know you could have gotten me
out of there sooner.

625
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,585
You know,
eve have to go through certain channels

626
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:11,247
to make things appear on the up-and-up.

627
00:42:12,022 --> 00:42:14,143
You know all about that,
don't you, Alex?

628
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:16,188
Keeping up appearances.

629
00:42:19,149 --> 00:42:20,149
Good.

630
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:23,630
I was just making sure
that we're still clear

631
00:42:23,712 --> 00:42:25,545
on the directive of this manhunt.

632
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:30,071
You know, I understand the,
uh, reasoning behind

633
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,953
Burrows and Scofield,
but these other men...

634
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:33,359
criminals that they may be...

635
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:36,960
- there's nothing in their profiles...
- You've been hired to do a job.

636
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,725
The reasoning does not concern you.

637
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:43,162
Don't ask any questions about us,
and maybe we'll continue

638
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:45,130
to make sure no one asks
any questions about you.

639
00:42:45,168 --> 00:42:46,230
Are we clear?

640
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,253
They all die.

641
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,880
They all die.

642
00:43:03,112 --> 00:43:06,758
