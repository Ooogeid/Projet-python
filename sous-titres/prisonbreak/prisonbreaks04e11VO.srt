1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,630
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,030
Company's moving Scylla.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,400
- When?
- Tomorrow.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,460
I messed up.

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,600
- What do you mean?
- I mentioned Whistler.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,660
Hello.

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,730
Hello?

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,030
So you're Feng.

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,000
- Susan.
- That's right.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,160
The wall itself is
fortified with steel fiber.

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,160
The bad news is that
there are both weight

12
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,830
and microphonic sensors

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
that will alert Company security

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
to the presence of any
breathing human being

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,760
that weighs more than two pounds.

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,330
Mike!

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,660
You have a hypothalamus hamartoma, 

18
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,400
and the doctor feels
that you need surgery.

19
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,560
- Two days.
- No, tomorrow.

20
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,760
Otherwise, you could die, and
there's no alternative.

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,660
Just a little bit more.

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,730
Go slow.

23
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,300
No, there's no way he
deserves any of this.

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,800
Sing it, sister.

25
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,900
After what he put me through?

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,700
I can hardly believe it myself.

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
Look, what we must do is

28
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,800
make sure that cosmic
justice rains down upon him, 

29
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,630
for once we obtain the
good general's card, 

30
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,730
there ain't hardly nothing standing

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,200
in between us and Mr. Feng's

32
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,630
$125 million.

33
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,000
I was born on a mountainside.

34
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,030
Just keep both hands on the camera.

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,200
Let's go.

36
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,760
That's great.

37
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,900
Okay.

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,130
Thank you so much, Dr. Malden.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, he can see you today at 3:00.

40
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,860
- No.
- We're going.

41
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,300
We need to finish what we started.

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,300
We can do this.

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,260
I need one more day.

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,500
Michael, Dr. Malden can see you today.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,330
He's given us his word

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
he won't alert the authorities.

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,200
If you put this off
and you, you collapse, 

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,960
you're going to be
treated by another doctor.

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,330
Do you want to roll the dice

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,060
that they're not going to call the cops?

51
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,730
There's still so much to do.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,860
All right.

53
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,630
Three o'clock?

54
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,160
Last time I drilled a hole in the wall, 

55
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,100
it was with an eggbeater back
in Fox River with Michael.

56
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,860
I just can't believe
it's all coming to an end, 

57
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,630
and he's not here.

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,400
He'll be all right.

59
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,230
How do you know?

60
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,300
I don't.

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,330
I'm just trying to keep us focused.

62
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,600
Hey.

63
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,600
He's sick, 

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,400
but I guarantee you one thing

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,400
that'll make him worse...

66
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,660
going back to jail.

67
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,730
If we don't get in there...
that's where we're all going.

68
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,000
He's going to be okay.

69
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,260
I'm scared, too, 

70
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,630
but a hospital's the best
place for him right now.

71
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,960
He won't go without a
plan to complete the job.

72
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,400
Well, Alex and Fernando
should be back soon

73
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,130
with the video, right?

74
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,460
Should be, yeah.

75
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,000
So, then, all we need is the sixth card.

76
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,300
Gretchen's working on that.

77
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,700
You really think we can trust her?

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,900
To get the card?

79
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,360
Absolutely.

80
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,360
Anything else?

81
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,660
Nope.

82
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,400
Eight guards will accompany
Scylla from the basement bunker

83
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,900
up to the garage, where an
armored truck will be waiting.

84
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,500
One truck is not going
to be enough security.

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,360
That is why I have a
full Secret Service escort

86
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,360
to March Air Force Base.

87
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,400
There, it will be
brought aboard a C-130.

88
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,700
We need air support all
the way to River Rock.

89
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,360
Colonel Rififi is lending
us three of his F-18s.

90
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,600
It may be hard for you to believe, 

91
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,500
but I do have this under control.

92
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,030
There's nothing for you to worry about.

93
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,500
When the plane lands, the same
precautions will be taken.

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,500
Armored truck

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,430
to guards to final location.

96
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,630
That's fine.

97
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Are you going somewhere?

98
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,530
- I have an appointment.
- Today?

99
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
You told me there was
nothing to worry about.

100
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,130
Just tell me it's not Gretchen.

101
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,560
This is ridiculous.

102
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,700
It's a personal matter.

103
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
I'm not going to discuss it.

104
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,430
I don't trust her.

105
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,960
That's nothing new.

106
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,130
I'll be back in an hour.

107
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,800
What'd you find out?

108
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,030
You'll be awake the whole time.

109
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,360
The only anesthetic
you're going to need is

110
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,060
four minor injections of local...

111
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,030
two in your forehead and
two in the back of your head.

112
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,330
And that's for the brace?

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,930
The frame, yeah, and...

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,630
attaching that is going to be
the most uncomfortable part.

115
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,560
They're going to have to
secure four pins into your skull

116
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,600
and they're going to need
a small drill to do it.

117
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,460
Do we have to listen to this?

118
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,730
I want to hear this, Linc.

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,660
And then what?

120
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,660
Uh, another CT scan.

121
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,830
The doctor will use

122
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,130
the three-dimensional
imagery to pinpoint

123
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,930
the exact location of the growth.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,230
And once you have that?

125
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,900
Then it's the Gamma Knife unit.

126
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,730
They'll fit you with a helmet, 

127
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,560
they'll calibrate it so
that each of the 201 holes

128
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,500
are aimed directly for the
tumor, and at that point...

129
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,460
I've got two more boxes in the car

130
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,660
that you guys got to bring in yourself.

131
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,330
All right.

132
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,630
You okay?

133
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,660
- Because the last time I saw you...
- Yeah, I'm fine.

134
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,530
I was just a little dehydrated.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,100
All right, good.

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
This is the stuff you requested.

137
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,160
You sure this is gonna get you in?

138
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,760
Let us worry about getting in.

139
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,200
You worry about how we're getting out.

140
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,860
I got someone keeping an
eye on Gretchen and Bagwell.

141
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,030
If they try anything, they're
getting taken out.

142
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,360
Nothing is going to get
between us and Scylla.

143
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,630
You sure you're all right?

144
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,360
Yeah, it's just, uh, 

145
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,560
you know, we're breaking
into Company headquarters, 

146
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,030
and, uh, you'll understand why
we're all a little on edge.

147
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,500
Understood.

148
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,700
You know, I was thinking, 

149
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,360
when your father approached
me about doing this, 

150
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,800
I felt like I was, uh, 

151
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,660
chasing a ghost or something, but...

152
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,460
Because of the work you guys have done, 

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,800
taste the day, when to
take these bastard down.

154
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,660
You get it?

155
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,830
Got it.

156
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,660
We got four hours.

157
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,000
How come?

158
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,430
I'm going in for treatment.

159
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,300
Here we go.

160
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,560
Scylla.

161
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,830
Obviously, we've got a lot to figure out.

162
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,600
We have to break through two walls...

163
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,960
one concrete, one glass...

164
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,560
and do it without making a sound.

165
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,000
Hypersensitive parabolic microphones, 

166
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,560
pointed in all directions.

167
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,600
The floor sensors can detect

168
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,060
an added surface load
of just two pounds.

169
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,330
So...

170
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,630
we have to traverse the
distance between the two walls

171
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,030
without touching the floor

172
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,660
and do all that without
generating any kind

173
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,030
of body heat whatsoever.

174
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,360
These are the latest in
heat-sensing technology.

175
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,360
We make one wrong move, 

176
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,160
the camera goes on, and General
Krantz will know we're inside.

177
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,600
It's amazing.

178
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,760
All this security and only one man

179
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,200
has access to video surveillance?

180
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,360
The Company doesn't want any record

181
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,600
of what's going on down there.

182
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,130
Can we access that elevator?

183
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,360
No, it's right in the middle

184
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,800
of the Company building...
there are ten layers

185
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,360
of security. We have to go where they're

186
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,960
not expecting us, 

187
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,030
starting with the concrete wall.

188
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,460
- Sucre, you were drilling there, right?
- Yes.

189
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,330
It's fortified with steel
fibers, just like you said.

190
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,560
All right, in order to get

191
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,900
through that, we have to generate

192
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,500
an electromagnetic field...

193
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,700
We have to generate an
electromagnetic field...

194
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,400
To have, uh, 

195
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,130
an electromagnetic field

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
with the force that we
want, we're going to need

197
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,360
at least a couple of car batteries.

198
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,500
Can you get that?

199
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,230
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,930
We can do this.

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,330
Uh, what time are we expecting Gretchen

202
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,960
to get that sixth card?

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
What took you so long?

204
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,730
You know how I get when I'm hungry.

205
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
It wasn't easy getting
away from the office.

206
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,260
I could have come to you...

207
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,330
like old times.

208
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,760
I almost wish there was
a mahogany desk in here.

209
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,900
Oh... you're tense.

210
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,460
Take off this jacket.

211
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,530
Let me get in there.

212
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,400
I didn't bring it with me.

213
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,800
My card.

214
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,460
That is what you're looking for, right?

215
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,330
What are you talking about? Your card.

216
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,630
You forget.

217
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm the one that taught you how to lie.

218
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,900
I never thought that, at the age of 63, 

219
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,530
I could still have my heart broken.

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,960
Why did you feel you
needed to steal my card?

221
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,860
Don't you know that if you'd
waited just a little bit longer, 

222
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,600
you'd have had one of your own?

223
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm sorry. I'm...

224
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,330
Who are you selling it to?

225
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,500
That's... That's not why...

226
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,230
Who?

227
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,730
I'm the mother of your child.

228
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,900
Please, for Emily's sake.

229
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,460
Please, Jonathan.

230
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,260
Please.

231
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,200
I love you.

232
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,160
If I ever see you again...

233
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,660
I'll shoot you on sight.

234
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,200
Is everything all right, Cole?

235
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,000
I got something important
you need to know.

236
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,300
We're gonna be rich.

237
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,300
So, here's the question.

238
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,530
How much is it gonna cost me

239
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
to get that jacket off of you?

240
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,830
Excuse me?

241
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,660
Last day I'm ever gonna see you.

242
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,860
Oh.

243
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,530
You're all covered up.

244
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,330
I cannot abide. $100.

245
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,660
You want to pay me to
take my clothes off?

246
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,530
Not all of them. Just the jacket. Mm.

247
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,200
- $200.
- I'm not gonna strip for you.

248
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,400
Pity on an old man.

249
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,830
You're disgusting.

250
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,360
And lecherous and vile.

251
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,630
And soon to be wealthy beyond belief.

252
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,100
One thousand dollars.

253
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,400
Why so modest all of a sudden?

254
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,030
Cole, I need to see you in my office now.

255
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,130
Mm-mm...

256
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,730
Thank you for calling
Gate. How can I help you?

257
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,130
It was Mr. White in his
office with the lead stapler.

258
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,500
Cole, yesterday, with that Idaho group, 

259
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,600
you made this company $35, 000.

260
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,730
And I would like to return the favor.

261
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,800
It's our annual cruise.

262
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,930
Seven days and six nights
of non-stop pitching.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,900
I personally clear
$50, 000 on most trips, 

264
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,630
but for everything you've done, 

265
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,230
it's all yours.

266
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,700
The least I could do.

267
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,360
It leaves today?

268
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,730
Go home and pack.

269
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,260
I'll see you in a week.

270
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,530
Unfortunately, I have some business

271
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,630
I need to take care of right here.

272
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,460
Okay, so, this is how it works.

273
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,860
As soon as the sensors pick
up any kind of a heat source

274
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,130
90 degrees or more, system
goes into standby, 

275
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,430
a yellow light comes on.

276
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,800
After five seconds in standby, 

277
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,330
if the heat source isn't
gone, we have an alarm.

278
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,030
So we got six seconds to
make it across the hallway

279
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,260
and through the glass wall?

280
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,830
Basically.

281
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,200
If we get our hands on
some liquid nitrogen, 

282
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,730
we could regulate the temperature.

283
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,100
Yeah.

284
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Kill two birds with one stone.

285
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,260
See if you can get some of that.

286
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey.

287
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,460
Hey.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm not going to ask how you're feeling.

289
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,530
Good.

290
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,660
About four years after
I joined the bureau, 

291
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,400
my first special agent in charge...

292
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,960
he was diagnosed with liver cancer.

293
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,800
But for him, 

294
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,360
the hardest part wasn't the treatment.

295
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,200
The hardest part was leaving the office, 

296
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,800
because we had this...
we had this big RICO case

297
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,800
that was about to go to trial, 

298
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,360
and we're talking thousands

299
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,730
of man hours, five years of research.

300
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,130
And the guy was going to be in chemo.

301
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,960
And he was scared.

302
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,200
He was scared that we
were gonna lose the case, 

303
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,800
and that a lot of bad
men were gonna walk.

304
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,400
He had a ragtag band of criminals

305
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,200
ready to pick up the slack.

306
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,730
It was something like that.

307
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,300
We're not going to let you down, Michael.

308
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
What happened to your boss?

309
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,960
Oh, he was there to see us win.

310
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,200
You're sure she's a Fed?

311
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,660
Wouldn't take off her jacket
for a thousand dollars.

312
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,230
She's got a gun under there.

313
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,460
It's a complication.

314
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,560
Well, that's a nice way to put it.

315
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,500
Sort of like you not
getting the sixth card.

316
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,200
What are we calling that now, a setback?

317
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,760
Relax.

318
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,130
You have any idea what
I'm giving up here?

319
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,730
I was guaranteed 50 grand.

320
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,730
You're crying over
$50, 000? Are you serious?

321
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,200
I have a job.

322
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,860
I make money. I get mail.

323
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,330
People call me sir.

324
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
12-hour days and
eating leftover lo-mein.

325
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,300
Something tells me Theodore Bagwell

326
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,930
wouldn't last long in this situation.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,930
Yeah, maybe, 

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,060
but Cole Pfeiffer would.

329
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,730
You want to pout, you do it tomorrow.

330
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
We have work to do.

331
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,660
Is it really worth $125 million?

332
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,160
It's worth twice as much.

333
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,260
What if they refuse to hand it over?

334
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,660
Either we pay for
Scylla, or we kill for it.

335
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,960
Susan?

336
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,130
Feng, we need to talk.

337
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,600
Hey, give me a second
here, guys, just a second.

338
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,600
We can't make any noise
above ten decibels.

339
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,730
You got two of those?

340
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,260
Absolutely.

341
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,930
This is gonna work, right?

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
It should.

343
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,100
No, not just that.

344
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,730
The whole thing.

345
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,900
I mean, do we even have a chance?

346
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,560
Just make sure the hole
is in the right place.

347
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,530
So, where are we?

348
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,230
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

349
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,030
We need that sixth card, Don.

350
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,700
I know.

351
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,200
If we don't get the sixth
card, we're never gonna crack Scylla.

352
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,360
I know it.

353
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, we know they're
moving Scylla today.

354
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,230
We know we can't just waltz
into the General's office

355
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,400
and steal that last card, 

356
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,630
so where does that leave us?

357
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,060
Then there's got to be a way.

358
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,160
- There has to be a way.
- Not without losing another man.

359
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,360
Believe me, I spent the last
week trying to figure out

360
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,360
how to get that sixth
card, and every scenario ends

361
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,630
with a gun to someone's
head, and that is not acceptable.

362
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,400
You know, Gretchen did
pass on this one piece

363
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,030
of information for you.

364
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
This could be helpful.

365
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Hello?

366
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,200
The buyer just showed up.

367
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,630
All right, well, find
out what they're up to.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,230
Mr. Feng, so glad you
could come and see us.

369
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,800
I was expecting the next time

370
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,660
the three of us would be
in the same room together, 

371
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,600
that you'd have something for me.

372
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,230
That was our expectation, as well, 

373
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,900
but we've hit a few bumps in the road.

374
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,230
Now, to ensure the item's

375
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,200
safe recovery, we need your help.

376
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,330
It's time to go.

377
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,530
"All that avails is flight."

378
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
Maybe my father was onto something.

379
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,000
If they all die

380
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,130
because we tried to
take down the Company, 

381
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,230
and I survive because...

382
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,360
because I called in sick...

383
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,630
...how am I gonna live with myself?

384
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,100
You're gonna get through this.

385
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm not going to the hospital.

386
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,560
What?

387
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,200
Linc, just get in the car.

388
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm going with you.

389
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,200
If I still had a medical license, 

390
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,230
I'd lose it over this.

391
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,700
This is usually given to epileptics.

392
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,030
It will suppress the
rapid firing of neurons

393
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,830
for the next three hours, 

394
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
making it unlikely

395
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,460
that you'll have a seizure in that time, 

396
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,360
but Michael, any added
mental or physical stress...

397
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,430
I get it.

398
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,760
I mean it.

399
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,530
I don't want you to move
unless you absolutely have to.

400
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
And as soon as this is over, I'm
taking you to the hospital.

401
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,000
Hey.

402
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
You all right?

403
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,700
This is gonna go exactly as planned.

404
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,800
I promise.

405
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm not praying for me.

406
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,100
Let's go.

407
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,130
You wanted to see me?

408
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,260
It's the second Tuesday of the month.

409
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,600
Don't you have your
Eagles and Angels luncheon?

410
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,600
I figured I'd skip it today.

411
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,330
You called me in here to
confirm my lunch plans?

412
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,760
You were right.

413
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,330
If it weren't for you, this
would be in the wind.

414
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,300
- Is she dead?
- Let's just say

415
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,960
she won't bother either of us anymore.

416
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,000
But I do want Scylla moved right now.

417
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,460
Our mechanics are on the
tarmac inspecting the C-130.

418
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,800
When they sign off, we'll
be ready to move.

419
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,800
Call the other card
holders, get them in here.

420
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,860
Did, uh, Self call you, uh, regarding

421
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,130
a little snafu with the General?

422
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,530
Get out of my way.

423
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,160
Just for, uh, clarification's sake, 

424
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,300
the sixth card is part of the
to-do list, right, gentlemen?

425
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,030
The game's afoot.

426
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,200
Does Michael have a way to get the card?

427
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,000
I've worked with
Michael Scofield before, 

428
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,200
both with him and against him.

429
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,500
There's no way he's going down there

430
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,800
without a plan to finish the job.

431
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,160
I got a call from an old friend.

432
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,330
Heard Scylla was in play.

433
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,760
He wants to know if he can get in on it.

434
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,730
A bidding war?

435
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,330
He's prepared to offer 200.

436
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,500
Is he for real?

437
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,900
I don't know. I've set up a safe house

438
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,930
where we can hear him
out. Do you have a pen?

439
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,900
Just a minute.

440
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,560
1917 Piermont.

441
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,700
One nine one seven

442
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,130
Piermont... got it.

443
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,430
I'm on my way.

444
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,800
Uh, good afternoon.

445
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,260
Thank you for calling Gate.

446
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,030
I got some last minute negotiations

447
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,860
with the buyer to speak about.

448
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,200
I'll be back lickety-split.

449
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,460
See you later.

450
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,800
Mm-hmm. Can you hold, please?

451
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,460
All right.

452
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,260
This is it.

453
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,530
Now, does anyone have any questions

454
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
about what they're supposed to do?

455
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,930
That hole you drilled in
the wall this morning...

456
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,100
once we get over there, if
we make too much noise, 

457
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,060
the sound waves will
travel through the wall

458
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,800
and get picked up by the
sensors on the other side.

459
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,460
So, from this point on, we
need absolute silence.

460
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,860
Alex, good luck.

461
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,530
You too.

462
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,160
Ready?

463
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,830
We have to break through two walls...

464
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,200
one concrete, one glass...

465
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,500
and do it without making a sound.

466
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,900
In order to get through that, 

467
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,060
we have to generate an
electromagnetic field.

468
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,130
To have

469
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,100
an electromagnetic field with the force

470
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
that we want, we're gonna need

471
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,930
at least a couple of car batteries.

472
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,400
...starting with the concrete wall.

473
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,060
Sucre, you were drilling there, right?

474
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,860
It's fortified with steel
fibers, just like you said.

475
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,900
You sure this is it?

476
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,900
1917 Piermont Avenue.

477
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,260
Okay.

478
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,360
When was the last time you swept a room?

479
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,060
The academy.

480
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,060
All right, just follow my lead, okay?

481
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,730
Because Gretchen and Bagwell
have no respect for human life.

482
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,130
- Okay? They go for a weapon, you shoot.
- Okay.

483
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,700
They try to run, you shoot.

484
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,830
If they do anything than
kneel down and put their hands

485
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,930
- behind their heads...
- I shoot.

486
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,260
And don't miss.

487
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,900
Agent Self.

488
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,330
We've been waiting.

489
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,900
That's Feng. He's got them.

490
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,500
When Scofield and Burrows
walk through the door, 

491
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,060
give them an opportunity to surrender.

492
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,630
If we can avoid confrontation, that's
the best case scenario.

493
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,830
There's no way they're gonna
hand it over without a fight.

494
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,460
If they take that
position, we'll respond in kind.

495
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,600
$125 million.

496
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,500
Only cherry that could
top this sunny day.

497
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,000
You can keep your Burrows and
your Mahone and your Sucre.

498
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,030
Just leave Scofield for me.

499
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,100
We got a green light on the C130.

500
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,030
It's time.

501
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,230
Thank you.

502
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,600
Oren, Tuxhorn and Edison are standing by.

503
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,400
Scuderi was in Las Vegas.

504
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,400
You think we could
get the state of Nevada

505
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,700
to outlaw gambling?

506
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,200
I somehow doubt that.

507
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,200
His plane will touch
down within about an hour.

508
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,360
Then you can make your luncheon.

509
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,400
I would rather stay.

510
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,960
Now more than ever, 

511
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,700
we need the support of law enforcement.

512
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,430
I will call you

513
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,360
- when we're ready to move.
- General, I...

514
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,160
There's nothing more
for you to worry about.

515
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,930
Lisa?

516
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,960
Very good work.

517
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,060
I need a team downstairs. Now.
