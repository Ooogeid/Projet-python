1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,460
Previously on prison break...

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,800
This is an overview.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,060
That's just the beginning of what's on here.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,960
You honor your side of the agreement,

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,800
And i will do the unveiling at the conference tomorrow.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,630
I thought we were working with these people.

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,030
So did i.

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,060
Damn well almost got

9
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,760
Our asses handed to us getting these.

10
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,200
These things are for tomorrow.

11
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,765
I want Scylla today!

12
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,007
Vincent Sandinsky.

13
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:20,833
- Yes? - let's go.

14
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:23,032
What are you going to do?

15
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:24,263
I warned you not to come, Michael.

16
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:28,032
Well, it's not over, not by a long shot.

17
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:31,000
Christina Rose Scofield-- that name mean anything to you?

18
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:32,330
No.

19
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:35,433
How badly do you want him, mom?

20
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,333
Michael, listen to me.

21
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,531
That's not an answer.

22
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,963
I'll be in touch.

23
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,303
I get the ass-kicking of a lifetime

24
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:51,401
And you come back empty-handed?

25
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:53,402
- What? - Linc and Michael's mother--

26
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:54,492
She's got Scylla

27
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:55,963
Here in Miami.

28
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:58,033
Fuel the jet.

29
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:00,863
We're going to Miami.

30
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:10,830
The guy knows something.

31
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,702
I don't know what else i can do to help

32
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,133
You guys. please let me go.

33
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,061
I won't say a word to anyone about this.

34
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:18,233
Never heard of the name Christina Scofield?

35
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:19,463
I told you, no.

36
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:20,761
Never?

37
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:22,431
Never.

38
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,961
Yeah.

39
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,000
That guy you picked up at the airport.

40
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,763
There's something you should know.

41
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:35,803
What do you mean?

42
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:38,590
He's not some innocent victim, Linc.

43
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:41,863
He and Christina have been exchanging e-mails,

44
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,161
Phone calls, you name it.

45
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,363
They've got some kind of plan.

46
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:48,663
I just haven't figured it out yet.

47
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:51,901
- Thanks. - so what are you going to do with him, linc?

48
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:55,732
Leave town, Michael.

49
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:57,131
Linc?

50
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,332
Where's Scylla?

51
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:04,400
No.

52
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:05,962
Where's Scylla?!

53
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:17,202
You ready?

54
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:21,462
- Almost. - is that Sandinsky's phone? yeah.

55
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,801
Good luck.

56
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,262
Thanks, i may need it.

57
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,331
It's Michael again

58
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:42,030
On Sandinsky's phone.

59
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,261
I thought he turned it off.

60
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,401
Well, now it's on.

61
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:45,563
Track it.

62
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,700
Michael?

63
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,492
Hello, Christina.

64
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,262
I hope

65
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,403
You're ready to talk.

66
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,731
Let's start with Vincent Sandinsky.

67
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:55,760
Vincent Sandinsky

68
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:57,160
The scientist?

69
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,490
He, uh, he's an old friend of mine.

70
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:01,800
A bit of a bore, don't you think?

71
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,903
But who cares about him?

72
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,963
I'd rather talk about you.

73
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,461
I'd rather meet you face-to-face.

74
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:12,002
Unless you're bringing me Scylla, i'm not interested.

75
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,802
No scylla, no meeting.

76
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,400
That's all i can offer.

77
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:18,700
What do you hope to accomplish?

78
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:20,662
I need your answer in ten minutes, and that's

79
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,701
The last time i'm calling back.

80
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,561
And found him.

81
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:31,000
He's in an industrial park in El Portal.

82
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,102
Right up the coast.

83
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:33,231
All right,

84
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:35,631
Let's go.

85
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:38,732
You're lying, you're lying.

86
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:39,832
I don't work for the company,

87
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,333
Six words that never prove true.

88
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:44,732
Come on, man, this is over, look around!

89
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,033
- What are you doing here?! - i swear i don't

90
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,230
know anything, i do

91
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:48,830
I don't know what he's talking about.

92
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:49,963
I am here for a conference,

93
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,360
That's all, i don't know

94
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,630
- Who told you otherwise. - i do,

95
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:54,201
And Michael's also full of crap.

96
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,701
- He's got no reason to lie. - actually, he does.

97
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,561
Michael's leading us off the scent, so he can get in...

98
00:03:58,567 --> 00:03:59,730
He doesn't want Christina to have Scylla

99
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:00,963
Any more than we do.

100
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,061
It's not the first time

101
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,491
He's lied to us.

102
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:05,033
Where is it?

103
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:09,200
- Linc. - come on, Linc,

104
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,863
He can't talk if he's dead.

105
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:15,533
- You got three seconds. - no

106
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:17,500
Burrows!

107
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:23,561
Put the gun down.

108
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:26,232
Vincent and i need to talk.

109
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,002
Vincent?

110
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:39,202
We had a deal.

111
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:41,203
New deal.

112
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:42,963
I'm taking charge.

113
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,731
Vincent and i

114
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:46,491
Are old friends.

115
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:48,800
Where'd you find him?

116
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,902
At an airstrip.

117
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:52,563
He's got something to do with Scylla.

118
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:54,301
Good.

119
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,490
Then you can help me find it,

120
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,902
Can't you, Vincent?

121
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:03,631
And you can help me find Christina Scofield.

122
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:06,403
Dr. Sandinsky has been

123
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,731
A company operative since--

124
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:11,902
How long's it been, Vincent?

125
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:14,402
21 years.

126
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:16,233
21 years of service.

127
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:19,262
Scientist, statistician,

128
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:21,330
Expert field combatant.

129
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:24,132
What brought you to Miami?

130
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,532
Does that help?

131
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,233
She invited me, okay?

132
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:31,830
She invited me.

133
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:34,001
- Who? - Christina Scofield.

134
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:35,233
I'm working with her.

135
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,562
That brings you full circle,

136
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:37,462
Doesn't it,Burrows?

137
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,403
But you knew that already.

138
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:40,762
When were you planning on

139
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,801
Telling me that your mother was behind all this?

140
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:46,032
We just found out.

141
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:48,562
But bottom line is, you knew.

142
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,230
All of you!

143
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:56,160
On your knees.

144
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,435
You heard him, get down.

145
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,437
Oh, not you.

146
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,933
I don't need to make deals

147
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,263
With men who can't do their jobs.

148
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:10,133
If Bagwell is the only one who is competent here,

149
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,262
He'll do it alone.

150
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,402
what?! Are you serious?!

151
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,460
Who do you think found this guy?!

152
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,931
Where's Scylla?

153
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:22,300
I don't know.

154
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:23,761
I don't.

155
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:26,531
She doesn't tell me where she keeps it,

156
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,233
But i do know where she's staying.

157
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:33,200
A place called edgewater tower, room 1099.

158
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:36,100
You have today.

159
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:39,303
One day.

160
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:58,563
mchanks  fjh131

161
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:14,803
You're wasting time, Burrows.

162
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,031
One day.

163
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,460
You tipped him off.

164
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:35,262
No, Bagwell.

165
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:38,702
You stay here.

166
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,202
Yeah, Theodore.

167
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:42,360
He needs you.

168
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:44,601
But you'd better stay away from us.

169
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,631
This is where Michael's signal is coming from?

170
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:58,260
Yeah.

171
00:07:58,268 --> 00:07:59,662
Be careful.

172
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:18,962
Stay here.

173
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:05,161
Let's go.

174
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,302
Let's go!

175
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:08,503
He's leaving.

176
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:17,901
Come on, he can't be that far away.

177
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:25,231
Out.

178
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:45,431
Let's go.

179
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:08,931
All right.

180
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:13,231
Where is it?

181
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:16,793
You don't really expect me to answer that, do you?

182
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:18,861
Actually, i do,

183
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,333
Because your life depends on it,

184
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:22,732
And considering your track record,

185
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,032
I think it's safe to assume

186
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:27,263
That you're always looking out for number one.

187
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:31,493
I've waited 25 years for this moment, Michael.

188
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:35,231
There's no way i can say everything i want to say.

189
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:36,201
Why should i let you?

190
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:38,262
Because i'm your mother.

191
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:41,001
That's something you can't change.

192
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,002
It's something you can't take away.

193
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,831
It's nice to meet you, Sara.

194
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,761
In some ways, Michael's done very well

195
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:52,992
For himself.

196
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:56,100
In other ways, i'm not so sure.

197
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:59,292
Lincoln has led you down a dark path.

198
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:00,932
I make my own decisions.

199
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:02,663
You break Lincoln

200
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,463
Out of prison and he goes to work for general Krantz.

201
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:08,263
And he has his reasons.

202
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:11,200
But if you're looking for some kind of common ground

203
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,101
Between us, maybe that's it.

204
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,132
I don't want to see Lincoln working for the company, either.

205
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:18,690
At least you've stopped making excuses for him.

206
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:20,963
I stopped making judgments.

207
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:22,830
Something i couldn't afford.

208
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:24,732
But that was a long

209
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,962
Time ago, and that's not why we're here.

210
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,660
No.

211
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:31,133
You're right.

212
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:34,891
None of us wants to see Scylla go back to the company.

213
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:37,102
So, if we can put the past behind us,

214
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:39,661
Maybe we can work something out.

215
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,103
Like what?

216
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:43,263
Like a deal.

217
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,702
"A deal"?

218
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,391
All right,

219
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,860
You tell me where Scylla is,

220
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,030
And we'll work out the details later.

221
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,662
We'll go 50-50.

222
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,991
A mother-son operation?

223
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,262
Maybe.

224
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:00,061
But first, Scylla.

225
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:03,800
Please, Michael, i know better.

226
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:08,531
We're very similar.

227
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,102
I know what it's like to look at the big picture,

228
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,732
See all the little moving parts...

229
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,703
How much easier it is to think after the surgery.

230
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,400
I know you.

231
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,861
That's why you'll never be able to manipulate me

232
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,631
Like you do the rest of the world.

233
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:30,030
You're running out of time.

234
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:54,461
All right, there's no one back here!

235
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:55,933
Well, they were here, but of course,

236
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,991
There's nobody here now.

237
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,332
'cause that's what happens.

238
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,191
You know, this

239
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,733
Whole thing...

240
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:04,861
It's just...

241
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,301
It's just... crap!

242
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,830
We're always one move behind,

243
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,231
Every step of the way.

244
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:13,431
Yeah, and it's just going to get worse now that Bagwell

245
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:15,030
Is breathing down our backs.

246
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,961
How do you make that kind of mistake, huh?!

247
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:20,062
And let that inbred get anywhere near us.

248
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,362
No, no, no, the first mistake was working for Krantz.

249
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,162
Okay, that was the first mistake. what do you think's

250
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,162
Going to happen now that he's in town and he has his goons

251
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,400
Calling the shots? what's going to happen now?

252
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:30,230
Yeah, i should've known better

253
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,332
Than to get anywhere near this.

254
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:34,360
All right, you know what? we should go.

255
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:35,602
- Let's go. - no, we can't go,

256
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:37,260
because you saw the photo

257
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:38,360
You saw the photos, so you know

258
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:39,533
what he's going to do with them

259
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:41,993
We should have known what he was going to do with them!

260
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,830
- That's what we should've... - hey, hey, hey! just calm down.

261
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,432
You know what, the deal is over.

262
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,761
Okay? you know it, i know it.

263
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:49,830
Everybody knows it. we're not getting out of here!

264
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:51,860
We're going to take a walk right to the gallows,

265
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,733
Or somebody else is going to stab us in the back!

266
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:56,262
I did that walk and i survived.

267
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,931
Even if we win,

268
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,033
Do we win?

269
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,261
You don't believe that, do you?

270
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,831
Look, i'm going to do what i got to do.

271
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,333
If you don't want to roll with me, that's fine.

272
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,230
What is that?

273
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,530
Rental receipt, a silver minivan.

274
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:15,332
What is this?

275
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:29,530
What do you know about this?

276
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,990
We found a whole

277
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,630
Box of them down in Little Cuba.

278
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:33,662
Guns, too.

279
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:36,960
What do you know about this?

280
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:41,662
She wanted me to speak there.

281
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:43,363
About Scylla?

282
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,790
She said she'd give me the script

283
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,131
beforehand, that's all I know.

284
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:50,090
She said her interest was purely scientific.

285
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:52,533
Her interest was financial.

286
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,930
She came to me about a year ago with an idea.

287
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,991
Rather than build our organization

288
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:58,803
With Scylla as the permanent cornerstone,

289
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,960
She wanted to use the technology

290
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,030
To make a quick profit.

291
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,933
If certain events occurred,

292
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,892
Various nations might feel the need

293
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,500
For a more modern defense system,

294
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,861
And they'd come to us for the answers.

295
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,460
Solar weaponry.

296
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,460
Water desalination.

297
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,993
Now, what do you know about all this?

298
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,800
I told you all i know.

299
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:24,330
Well, i thought it was a crazy idea.

300
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:25,962
Plan of an amateur.

301
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,793
But i figured she'd be angry.

302
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:30,301
She wasn't allowed to hold a card.

303
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,933
Now, what was that?

304
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,430
I think it's more than that.

305
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,633
Really?

306
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,901
What did she tell you?

307
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:45,160
I know how the company operates.

308
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,862
Shell corporations like Ecofield,

309
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,403
Rampant misuse of funds.

310
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,602
You're literally sitting on a gold mine.

311
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:55,860
But your leadership

312
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,532
Only benefits you and your friends

313
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:59,330
Ten generations in the future.

314
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,091
And you

315
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:05,661
Would like to see the company implode?

316
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,833
I want to see something happen.

317
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:13,130
You think too small.

318
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,860
Laos?

319
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,192
We'll all be dead

320
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,192
Before that pays off.

321
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,130
Uh, "Laos," sir?

322
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,060
Don't trouble yourself.

323
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:28,462
Burrows?

324
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,093
I got a question for your friend.

325
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:31,363
What is it?

326
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,231
Ask him what the letters "DMB" mean.

327
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:36,732
Do the letters

328
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:39,730
"DMB" mean anything to you?

329
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,362
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,030
I thought you understood me.

331
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:54,992
She said her place was

332
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:58,163
On the same block as Dade-Miami bank.

333
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,890
Did you hear that?

334
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:02,933
I got it.

335
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,963
He'd better be telling the truth.

336
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:07,860
See what else the doctor knows.

337
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:10,732
- No... - what's Christina's plan?!

338
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:17,260
I don't know.

339
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:18,662
I don't know.

340
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,330
Maybe we should've...

341
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,661
Maybe we should've followed her or something.

342
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,032
Sit down for me.

343
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:31,700
How about i talk to her?

344
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,092
I might have some perspective.

345
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,933
She didn't leave me when i was six.

346
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:40,331
Okay.

347
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,032
I'm sorry we had to meet this way, Sara.

348
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,262
I'm sorry we had to meet at all.

349
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,130
Michael's been through a lot in

350
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:57,061
the last year at some point.

351
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:58,631
It's going to be too much for him.

352
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:00,231
Michael can handle it.

353
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:01,430
He's never known a life

354
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,930
Without change.

355
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:04,400
Oh, you say that like you know him.

356
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,933
Oh, i do.

357
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,331
Better than you.

358
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,501
I don't see how that's possible.

359
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:12,903
Well, you will when your child's born.

360
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:18,462
See, i wasn't sure at first, but you do have

361
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:19,632
That drawn look.

362
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:20,991
And i see the way you protect

363
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:23,062
Yourself when you sense danger.

364
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:27,931
You don't even know you're doing it. It's instinct.

365
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,992
And what is it you know about maternal instinct?

366
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:33,501
I've tried to be a mother.

367
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,231
Even to Lincoln.

368
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:37,161
How can you say that?

369
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:41,960
You left them without so much as an explanation.

370
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,290
But if Michael would listen...

371
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:45,293
You know what? you can stop.

372
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:48,100
You can't justify what you did.

373
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:52,191
Michael doesn't know you're pregnant,

374
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:54,963
Does he?

375
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,262
What happened?

376
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:06,063
Uh... i got nothing.

377
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:22,731
hello, Joyce.

378
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:24,960
How are you? my name is Don Self,

379
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,131
Homeland security.

380
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:27,632
Don't worry, there's nothing the matter.

381
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,433
I'm just here doing a favor for my friend.

382
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:30,733
See, his mother passed away yesterday.

383
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,191
Okay, and her last will and testament

384
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,702
Is in one of your security boxes.

385
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,262
It's actually box 6468.

386
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,591
Is he authorized to access it?

387
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:39,991
See, that's the problem. he's not.

388
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,960
But we're willing to fill out all the paperwork...

389
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,061
I'm sorry. only authorized individuals

390
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,390
Are allowed to access safe deposit...

391
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:46,862
Listen, lady, i need to get in that box.

392
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,291
Where's your boss?

393
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:50,093
Sir?sir, can i help you?

394
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,360
Yeah. i need to get in my mom's safe deposit box.

395
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:53,993
- Do you have a court order? - No. no.

396
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,893
- DMB policy prevents anyone... - here's the policy.

397
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:57,632
Okay, i need to open box 6468.

398
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,801
Right now. name's Don Self, homeland security.

399
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:01,560
Excuse me,Mr. Frank?

400
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,660
Number 6468 was accessed a minute ago.

401
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,860
He just left.

402
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:07,303
It was the guy with the silver suitcase.

403
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:15,430
There he is.

404
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:18,560
Hey, that looks like the guy from the embassy.

405
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:43,632
Mr. Banerjee, how are you?

406
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:45,560
I'm trying to reach Christina Hampton.

407
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,340
She's in a meeting right now.

408
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,262
I don't talk to her before five.

409
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,300
The deal is off.

410
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,593
Okay.

411
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,393
This is my final offer.

412
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:18,061
You're going to take me to Scylla,

413
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,460
And then you can walk.

414
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,462
No questions.

415
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:22,732
No one tells the General.

416
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,462
You can live the rest of your life

417
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:25,592
Like this never happened,

418
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:27,660
But Scylla is mine.

419
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,461
Lincoln would never let that happen.

420
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,532
He doesn't have to know.

421
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,533
Even as children, you couldn't agree.

422
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,731
You fought about everything.

423
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:40,460
The two of you couldn't be more different.

424
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:43,462
But you know that, don't you, Michael?

425
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:44,931
This isn't about Lincoln.

426
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:47,362
You have blue eyes, he has green.

427
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:50,132
He played with trucks.

428
00:21:50,137 --> 00:21:52,090
You took apart the television set.

429
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,093
And I don't need to point out

430
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,631
The difference in IQ

431
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:58,503
Or temperament.

432
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:00,803
You know what I'm getting at,

433
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:03,002
Don't you, Michael?

434
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:05,892
I don't have any idea

435
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,193
What you're talking about.

436
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:11,361
You've always known it deep in your heart.

437
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:15,361
You just had no one to confirm it.

438
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,462
Lincoln...

439
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,803
...Isn't your brother.

440
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:39,263
It's true.

441
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:41,393
I should have told you before,

442
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:45,532
But you always looked up to him, and

443
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:48,363
I had no idea things would happen like this.

444
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,430
You don't know what you're saying.

445
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:52,930
Have you ever

446
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:56,330
Seen pictures of Lincoln as a baby?

447
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:58,730
- Yes. - No.

448
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:01,363
There aren't any.

449
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:07,420
Your father didn't adopt him until he was three years old.

450
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:11,800
His parents worked for the company.

451
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,733
They were killed in an explosion in Manila.

452
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,560
Aldo brought him home the next day.

453
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,630
He felt it was his duty.

454
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:23,101
He didn't ask me how I felt.

455
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:27,533
I...I never bonded with him

456
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:30,092
Like mother and son.

457
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:34,630
He was always so angry.

458
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:36,361
Understandably so...

459
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:40,892
He was too young to remember his mother, but

460
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:45,131
He always knew something was missing.

461
00:23:45,136 --> 00:23:49,162
I can't believe you're playing this card.

462
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,830
I'm sorry, Michael.

463
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:57,262
But I felt differently about you.

464
00:23:57,265 --> 00:24:00,831
And you could tell.

465
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:02,532
That's why you always felt guilty.

466
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:04,590
Why you were always

467
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:05,762
Throwing yourself over the cliff

468
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,663
After Lincoln was already dead at the bottom.

469
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:10,532
It's why you went to prison and pissed your life away.

470
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:12,963
You don't know why I did

471
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:14,133
The things I did!

472
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,760
You weren't there!

473
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:21,431
Who knows what you could have accomplished.

474
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:25,733
But you always felt like you had to make less of yourself

475
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:30,703
To make Lincoln look less pathetic in comparison.

476
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:33,763
Lincoln was more

477
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:37,491
Of a brother to me than you were ever a mother.

478
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:39,633
You left.

479
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:42,702
He stayed.

480
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:46,262
He fed me.

481
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,293
Kept me off the streets.

482
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:49,863
Put me through school.

483
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:51,531
How?

484
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:54,060
By getting in trouble over and over again,

485
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:56,861
Just like he is right now.

486
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:58,493
What do you mean, right now?

487
00:24:58,507 --> 00:24:59,830
Where is he?

488
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:01,160
He's out

489
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:04,493
Looking for Scylla, and he's not going to find it.

490
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:07,702
Maybe you should call him and tell him.

491
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,533
Unless there's too much

492
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:12,903
Bad blood between you.

493
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:15,702
Or no blood.

494
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:45,263
Who's the guy in the ring?

495
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:48,091
Is it Michael?

496
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:50,431
He's gonna be all right. Just relax.

497
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:56,732
Where is he?

498
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:01,962
All right, keep up with him, come on.

499
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,703
I am. Just shut up.

500
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:13,060
It's not that I don't want to help you.

501
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:17,302
It's just that I hate to see you go running after him again.

502
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:19,893
Michael. Come here!

503
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:24,630
- Michael! - Where is he?

504
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:29,132
Okay. You want to go running after him,

505
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:30,561
Flush your life down the toilet

506
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,431
Once and for all? Go ahead!

507
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:34,063
Myself, I swear!

508
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:36,593
If don't you tell me where he is, or I'll kill you,

509
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:38,191
Myself, I swear!

510
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,332
I'll kill you myself.

511
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:40,603
Michael!

512
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:42,463
Michael!

513
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,460
Michael!

514
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:48,762
Come on! Tell me!

515
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:51,392
Where is he? where is he?

516
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:53,402
Where is Lincoln?

517
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:58,491
Where is Lincoln?

518
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:00,432
All right. Fine.

519
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,732
There's an energy conference

520
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:05,292
At the Panda Bay Hotel in about an hour.

521
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:07,293
He'll be there.

522
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:09,930
That's the truth.

523
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:43,661
I'm sorry.

524
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,460
I'm...

525
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:46,830
I don't know what to think.

526
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:48,391
Go. Go, go go.

527
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:49,990
Go find him.

528
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,432
I got her. Go.

529
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,661
If she gives you any trouble...

530
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,262
If she gives you any trouble...

531
00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:59,233
I know.

532
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:00,702
Just...go.

533
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:32,432
You have surpassed expectations, Bagwell.

534
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:35,393
You're much more than an informant.

535
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:37,863
I multitask.

536
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:40,732
Hmm. Well, if things go as well as expected here,

537
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:42,761
You'll be rewarded accordingly.

538
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:46,131
As a special liaison to the company?

539
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:47,731
Yes.

540
00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:50,392
What exactly does that entail?

541
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:52,390
Well, that would be up to you.

542
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:56,791
Most company operatives choose their own career path,

543
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:58,933
Though I can't say what would suit you.

544
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,992
What do sexual predators from Alabama typically do,

545
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,793
Uh, aside from the obvious?

546
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,233
Those days are behind me, general.

547
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:10,562
What I lack in formal education,

548
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,593
I more than make up for in

549
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:15,963
Natural skills and curiosity.

550
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:19,293
And as you've seen, my loyalty knows no bounds.

551
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:21,332
Then you shouldn't have any difficulty

552
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:22,790
Passing your final exam.

553
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:24,561
Now, you didn't

554
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,763
Expect that a few phone calls on the sly would set you up

555
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,332
For life, did you?

556
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,890
No, sir.

557
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:34,463
I'm ready for anything.

558
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,733
Good. Then prepare for this.

559
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:38,833
When Burrows brings Scylla back to us,

560
00:29:38,836 --> 00:29:43,361
I will fly it safely back to Los Angeles,

561
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:47,762
And you will be the one to put a bullet in his brain.

562
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:57,562
Sara?

563
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:03,660
What's going on in there?

564
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,561
Sara?

565
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:08,990
What do you want?

566
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:12,690
Oh, please, keep that open.

567
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:14,560
Why? So you can

568
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,993
Lob more accusations and assumptions out at me?

569
00:30:17,006 --> 00:30:19,860
I haven't made any.

570
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:22,300
Lincoln is adopted.

571
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:26,062
And you're pregnant.

572
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:29,063
You don't deny it, do you?

573
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,960
You should tell him.

574
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:35,362
He'd be happy, even under the circumstances.

575
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:36,862
It really isn't any of your business.

576
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:37,893
I'm sorry.

577
00:30:37,896 --> 00:30:40,692
Sometimes in-laws

578
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,300
Overstep their bounds, but...

579
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:46,130
You know, when it comes right down to it,

580
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:50,062
I am the only mother any of you will ever have, so...

581
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:52,891
You shouldn't throw that away so easily.

582
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,762
Yeah, you know, the only thing I get from you

583
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:57,231
Is a great example of the mother I don't want to be.

584
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:00,960
Sara?

585
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:03,862
It doesn't have to be like this.

586
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:04,860
Yeah, it does.

587
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:07,432
That was your decision a long time ago.

588
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:08,991
Can I just give you

589
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:10,463
One piece of advice?

590
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,402
Stay out of the bars.

591
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:19,793
That's good advice.

592
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,702
I have friends in AA.

593
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:26,661
They're only alcoholics.

594
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,930
I can only imagine what it's like for you,

595
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:30,793
Trying to stay off the smack.

596
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:33,163
It's morphine.

597
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:38,433
Hospital-grade morphine.

598
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,490
Christina Scofield will not be leaving miami tonight.

599
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:51,193
I want eyes at every airport and gas station

600
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,062
Between here and Atlanta.

601
00:31:53,065 --> 00:31:56,492
And I want the names of everyone attending that conference.

602
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,592
I thought you might be asking that question,

603
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:00,560
So I called the front desk of the hotel.

604
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:02,092
Said I was from the newspaper.

605
00:32:02,105 --> 00:32:03,892
Excuse the spelling.

606
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,033
These are all scientists.

607
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:10,330
I told you.

608
00:32:10,337 --> 00:32:11,732
Those are the speakers.

609
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,590
The names below are "special guests."

610
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,490
Sounded like bigwigs from all over the world.

611
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,730
"Frederich, Carlotto,

612
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,492
Linarte, Ban..."

613
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:20,632
"Banerjee"?

614
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:24,531
- Naveen Banerjee? - Who is that?

615
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:29,760
The son of prime minister Nandu Banerjee.

616
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,461
He has a known

617
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:34,932
Interest in solar weapons technology.

618
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:39,260
This will all be over by the end of the day.

619
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,991
Come on, Linc, where are you?

620
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:52,063
It's Linc.

621
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,131
You know what to do.

622
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,131
Linc, it's me.

623
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,192
Call me when you can.

624
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,930
We got to talk.

625
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:13,162
Mahone!

626
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,190
This way!

627
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:47,132
Christina.

628
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,860
Don't move.

629
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,662
Or I'll kill you both.

630
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:21,333
Where is he?

631
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,133
Where did he go?

632
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:24,631
There.

633
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:26,303
- Where is he? - Right there, right there.

634
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:40,332
- Lincoln, stop! - Why?

635
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:41,862
Wait, wait.

636
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:43,763
That's the hotel.

637
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:45,562
The energy conference.

638
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:47,663
That's right-- it's today.

639
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:50,363
The silver van.

640
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:52,263
The rental van.

641
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:53,633
They want us here.

642
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:54,931
Something's up.

643
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:56,960
What the hell is going on?

644
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:04,261
Downey.

645
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:06,163
It's for a getaway.

646
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,732
Lincoln, no!

647
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:10,731
Where are you?

648
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:11,560
Running.

649
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,033
Burrows is on my ass. Are you okay?

650
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,463
I was worried you didn't get away.

651
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:17,233
This whole thing could go to hell.

652
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:18,233
I'm fine.

653
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:19,391
I'm right on time.

654
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,632
See you soon.

655
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,960
Down.

656
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:27,703
Down.

657
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:28,702
Good girl.

658
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:34,590
He'll never forgive you for this,

659
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:36,660
And neither will his brother.

660
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:41,900
Soon, this will all be behind us.

661
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:02,533
Maybe I can meet my grandson one day.

662
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:40,533
Nomaash Kaar.

663
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:42,330
My apologies, Naveen.

664
00:36:42,337 --> 00:36:43,533
Where have you been?

665
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,463
I was told that you would call.

666
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:47,892
I got hung up on a few details for this evening.

667
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:49,763
You spoke with Downey?

668
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:51,461
It did very little to reassure me.

669
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:53,662
I need to speak to Dr. Sandinsky.

670
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:55,833
Oh, you haven't heard?

671
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:58,333
Dr. Sandinsky had a family emergency.

672
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:00,663
His wife was in a terrible accident.

673
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:01,931
I spoke with him this morning.

674
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:04,330
He took a private jet out this afternoon.

675
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:07,562
It's very late to be making these decisions now.

676
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,492
Yes, but you've come all this way.

677
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:11,530
You are prepared to give your speech

678
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:12,261
Aren't you?

679
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:13,490
Fine.

680
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:14,893
But in light of the fact

681
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:16,792
That I did not speak with the doctor,

682
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,991
I'll amend my offer.

683
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:22,462
$1 million in exploratory research.

684
00:37:22,468 --> 00:37:24,992
The rest will follow in the weeks to come.

685
00:37:25,006 --> 00:37:27,793
That's very generous, Naveen.

686
00:37:27,805 --> 00:37:29,761
History will thank you.

687
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:32,062
Your country will thank you.

688
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,133
See you soon.

689
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,832
May I have your attention, please?

690
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:51,791
We're about to begin.

691
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:53,892
Thank you. Welcome to Miami beach.

692
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:55,203
And thank you for attending the first

693
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:56,861
Global conference of its kind,

694
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:59,993
Where great minds will meet to explore our energy future.

695
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:02,061
The importance of finding new ways

696
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:04,893
To power our world should not be underestimated.

697
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,433
It's running.

698
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:08,830
Okay.

699
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:20,662
They rented this in Linc's name.

700
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,062
Look at this.

701
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:24,291
These passports. It's us.

702
00:38:24,307 --> 00:38:25,391
It's a setup.

703
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:27,532
- For what? - It's a setup!

704
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,330
Thank you.

705
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:42,032
5 o'clock.

706
00:38:42,508 --> 00:38:44,161
If Burrows doesn't call in the next five minutes

707
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,330
You're going downtown.

708
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:50,503
General, you should see this.

709
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:51,763
In the city of miami.

710
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,501
Today, the venue will be the panda bay hotel,

711
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:57,261
Where security it high in light of the important guests.

712
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,860
This includes Naveen Banerjee,

713
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:00,933
Son of prime minister Nandu Banerjee,

714
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:03,461
Who is scheduled to be the event's keynote speaker.

715
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,660
Banerjee's fragile political position

716
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:08,602
May leave him vulnerable to criticism on the world stage.

717
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:10,830
He has aggressively sought to place his ideas

718
00:39:10,836 --> 00:39:12,630
In the forefront of environmental policy

719
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:13,960
Both at home and abroad.

720
00:39:13,966 --> 00:39:15,732
Christina's plan.

721
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:18,501
What she needed to profit from Scylla.

722
00:39:18,507 --> 00:39:23,002
An incident that'll domino into global warfare.

723
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:25,400
And how these ideas can be implemented.

724
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,230
Miami was selected as the location...

725
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:28,863
Krantz.

726
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:30,633
You're out.

727
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,262
It's over now.

728
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,160
Has caused some tension between several factions.

729
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,760
So far, u.s. policymakers have resolved...

730
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:45,301
You do it.

731
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,232
Do it!

732
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:21,233
You need a pass!

733
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:22,503
At this point in our history,

734
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,802
Solar power accounts for less than one-tenth of

735
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:29,230
One percent of the total power generated in our world.

736
00:40:29,237 --> 00:40:31,830
And in the next ten years, that number

737
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,702
Should increase to ten percent,

738
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:34,963
But it's still not enough.

739
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,402
We must strive to seek new alternatives

740
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:40,730
So that we can break this cycle of oil dependence.

741
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,662
We cannot do that without your help.

742
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:47,362
To explore our new energy future

743
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:49,630
And envision a new tomorrow.

744
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:52,433
Now, our first guest is an author and an entrepreneur.

745
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:54,600
As well as having a notable heritage,

746
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:57,160
He has spoken to audiences across the world.

747
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:00,230
Please welcome, naveen banerjee.

748
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,532
Thank you, thank you.

749
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:09,862
Good evening, my friends.

750
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,531
It is my pleasure to be here with you today

751
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,802
In this beautiful city of sunlight.

752
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:18,501
Throughout the United States,

753
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:21,161
I find there to be great interest

754
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:25,603
In the changing way that we all power our world.

755
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:29,502
Many times i have been approached...

756
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:30,830
No!

757
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:33,961
With a proposal to reinvent the wheel.

758
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:35,862
New resources...

759
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,001
Michael!

760
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:07,460
Linc!

761
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:10,060
We've got to go.

762
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,963
She set the whole thing up.

763
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:19,700
She set the whole thing up.

764
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:28,131
Do you have it?

765
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:29,260
Right here.

766
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:30,502
How'd it go?

767
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:32,461
The van was there with the passports.

768
00:42:34,005 --> 00:42:35,201
I just got off the phone with our contact at the bank.

769
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:36,461
And they've got clean video of

770
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:39,361
Burrows trying to access the box.

771
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:42,200
He must have trashed the hotel room.

772
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:45,501
His hands were all over the shells.

773
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:47,000
You see Michael?

774
00:42:47,006 --> 00:42:49,100
He was there on my way out.

775
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,832
Lincoln's right back where he started.

776
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:57,603
But really it's too bad about Micheal.

777
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,201
I know you, uh...

778
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:01,560
Shut up and drive.
