00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,431
<i>Previously on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,550
Those ass-hats are worth more
dead than you and I are alive.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,840
Somebody's gonna get that money.
Might as well be me.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,518
You know, a job like that might...

5
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:11,659
go a little smoother
with an extra pair of hands.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,469
I want divers down in the river.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,890
Are you Scott Kolbrenner?

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,190
You must be Debra Jean.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,070
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, same here.

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,616
Apparently, Fibonacci's coming up
for air again,

11
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,550
and if he testifies at that hearing,
a lot of people are going down.

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,176
Caroline. They're taking her in.

13
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,830
Of course,
I'll keep an eye on her.

14
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,610
Hi, my name is Sara, and I'm an addict.

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,700
Hi, my name's Lance, and I'm an addict.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,350
Hi, Lance.

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,620
You did one hell of a job, doc.

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,940
It's okay for you to leave now.

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,213
Oh, I'm leaving, you're not.

20
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,159
<i>Where to, sir?</i>

21
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,368
Utah.

22
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:48,549
- Ready?
- Yeah.

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>So which one of them was it?</i>

24
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,266
Maybe Scofield.

25
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:59,438
Probably gonna find his
brother in there, too.

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,362
Are you meeting up with her, the doctor?

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,652
I don't know.

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,190
I knew the little whore
would take us right to 'em.

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,942
What happens when you get to Mexico?

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,300
Where will you go?

31
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,037
It's best if you don't know.

32
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,171
It's best for everyone.

33
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,664
We'll drop you off in the next town,

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,787
and I'll wire you that 10,000$,
like I said.

35
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,940
Shouldn't take more than a week or two.

36
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,874
Michael, we got company.

37
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,003
What's hell going on?

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,494
Hold on! Hold on!

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,350
Who is it?!

40
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:52,722
Who is it?!

41
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:56,861
It's Bellick!

42
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:07,054
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,300
Hold on.

44
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,833
Can this thing go any faster?!

45
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,876
What do you think?!

46
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,802
Look out!

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,841
Nobody move!

48
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,572
Nodody move!

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,937
Oh, good to see you again, boy.

50
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,098
No need for anyone to get hurt, boss.

51
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,240
Boss?

52
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,109
Oh, there's no need for formalities
anymore there, Sink.

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,540
I'm no longer an employee
of the state, thanks to you.

54
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,360
I think somebody wants that reward.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,361
Oh, it's not about reward money, friend.

56
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,435
Your pal Manche told me all about
your little treasure hunt

57
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,420
for Westmoreland's stash.

58
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:49,832
Get in the car.

59
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,920
We're going to Utah.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,339
PreSync: fisherchen - www.ydy.com
Resync, corrections: www.sub-way.fr

61
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:29,234
All the cops following you
all over the country,

62
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:31,710
when all they had to do
was tail the tail, you know?

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,440
Move that moneymaker, sweetheart.

64
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,200
Let's move it, convict.

65
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,809
If you know about the money
in Utah, why do you need us?

66
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,533
Well, the excitement of the escape,

67
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,525
Manche didn't hear
everything Westmoreland said

68
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:44,080
before the old bird kicked the bucket

69
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,440
But he heard enough:
Utah and five million.

70
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,917
You'll fill in the blanks.

71
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,108
Don't even think about
getting cute, smart-ass.

72
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:55,287
Now, you and your brother are gonna
take me right to where that money is,

73
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:56,761
or the whore gets dead real fast.

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,791
Ask me if I'm bluffing.

75
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:15,339
The dredging of the river under
Scofield's apartment bore some fruit.

76
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,550
Found a hard drive under the river bed.

77
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,331
Serial numbers match an order
that scofield put in with Dell

78
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:23,510
a few months before he was incarcerated.

79
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,593
They've recovered about 12%
of the data so far.

80
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,068
And this is helping us how?

81
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,325
Blood tests came back.

82
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,306
B- Negative all over that crash site.

83
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,801
- Scofield and burrows are both...
- B- negative. I know.

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,736
- I'll reach out to the media.
- How about don't?

85
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,092
If it gets out that the guy who...

86
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:02,090
Who masterminded this whole thing

87
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,628
is possibly dead,

88
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:06,176
and the other six cons are gonna
get their guards up even more.

89
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,880
It is our policy... Excuse me!

90
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,918
It is our policy not to announce
deaths until they're confirmed!

91
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,318
We've got an exploding
car and a blood match.

92
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:17,833
Well, then do more tests.

93
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,290
- On what?
- On the bumper.

94
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,050
I don't know. I don't care. Just delay.

95
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,582
I want those guys out there getting
more complacent, not more careful.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,170
<i>...governement policy to forge
ahead with its nuclear program.</i>

97
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,242
<i>In national news,</i>

98
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:33,568
<i>the eight escaped convicts</i>

99
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:37,396
<i>from Fox River penitentiary
in Illinois are still at large, and...</i>

100
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:39,569
I was listening to that.

101
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,632
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to hear this.

102
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,300
Really?

103
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,122
You like John Denver?

104
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,444
Yeah.

105
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:19,794
- This is good, this is good.
- Don't quit your day job.

106
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,876
What?

107
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:25,516
Nah, I just need a little
tequila to get my karaoke on.

108
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,541
Yeah.

109
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:31,691
Here, yo, slow down.

110
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,683
- We're doing, like, 65 in a 60...
- Yo, slow down.

111
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:39,207
All right, dad.

112
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:46,935
Yo, we can't be having that, man.

113
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,184
Tickets are, like, 200 bones.

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,980
Yeah.

115
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,716
I never thought I'd say this, Scofield

116
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:59,680
but I thank god for the day
you walked into Fox River.

117
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,854
And out of it.

118
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,830
It's gonna be okay.

119
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,933
I don't want to hear from you right now.

120
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,830
You told me nothing would happen.

121
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,709
You promised me.

122
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:18,984
That's one pissed off commie you
got on your hands there, scofield.

123
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:21,190
Didn't your mama tell
you how to treat a lady?

124
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,909
Or was she a whore like this one?

125
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,230
Linc!

126
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,716
Got a problem there, Burrows?

127
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,711
We only need one of you
to take us to the money.

128
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,093
Remember that.

129
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,301
Let's go, buddy.

130
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,470
Let's go.

131
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,295
I'd been really drunk
at the wedding speech.

132
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,069
And this was the first time
that we'd spoken since then.

133
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,928
And it was cleansing.
It was really cleansing.

134
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:47,952
Thank you.

135
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,479
Good share, Ralph.

136
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,096
Well, we're out of time.

137
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:57,140
Unless there are any burning desires...

138
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,610
Actually, I'd like to...

139
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:00,645
You know, if there's time.

140
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,234
Of course.

141
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,261
I'm Lance, and I'm an addict.

142
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,372
Hi, Lance.

143
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,196
My, uh, mother died of M.S.

144
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,574
Last week.

145
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,749
She just...

146
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,081
Gave out.

147
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,891
Just like my grandfather
did, just like my sister did.

148
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,961
Just like I...

149
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,726
If I may?

150
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,180
Lance, M.S. isn't usually
considered genetic.

151
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,003
Really? What are you, a doctor?

152
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,747
I am, actually.

153
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,968
Sorry.

154
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,206
Thank you.

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,589
All right, everybody, face the
wall and look straight ahead!

156
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,642
Eyes front.

157
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,448
How was your flight?

158
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,609
Bumpy.
Everything is ready?

159
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,577
We got a container ship
down at the navy yard.

160
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:14,820
The captain's one of ours.

161
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,000
He's got a stateroom listed as
a cargo hold on the manifest.

162
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,100
You and your family will be on
it when it sets sail tomorrow.

163
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,503
Six days from now, John, you'll
be in Sardinia.

164
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,279
Good work.

165
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,254
Sylvia.

166
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:36,864
Dad!

167
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,978
We missed you.

168
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:44,169
It's over.

169
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,272
I missed you, too.

170
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,504
It's over, it's over.

171
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:41,394
Come on.

172
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,275
Come on.

173
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:57,354
What the hell are you doing?

174
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,784
Mind your own business.

175
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:20,283
What kind of son of a bitch doesn't
have a spare tire in his car?

176
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,930
The kind that already used it.

177
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,408
Then you're just the sad sack

178
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,820
that has to go back
into town to get a new one.

179
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,460
That's like three miles.

180
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,715
That's right.

181
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,379
All right, everybody out.

182
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,780
That way, come on.

183
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,970
Careful.

184
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,284
Don't touch me.

185
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,662
Just relax.

186
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,340
You know,
I believed everything you told me,

187
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,173
and I did everything you asked.

188
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,020
I risked my life for you.

189
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,581
For what? For $10,000, I risked my life?

190
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,686
And this entire time, you've had
$5 million just waiting there.

191
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,811
You're a bastard, Michael.

192
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,525
For all the aggravation, I hope you
got to hit that a few times, scofield.

193
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:20,794
We're going to wait it
out in that shack.

194
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,990
Keep moving, come on.

195
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,094
Come on.

196
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,369
Fantasia, get going.

197
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,253
I need to talk to you...alone.

198
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,060
What do you want?

199
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,937
To ruin his life like he's ruined mine.

200
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,025
Where you coming from?

201
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,886
Me?

202
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,155
I was just hitting the head, boss.

203
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,923
What's your name?

204
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,597
Clyde.

205
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,067
Clyde May.

206
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,856
You got any id, Mr. May?

207
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:03,496
I don't, uh...

208
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,445
Drive anymore, so don't
really have id per se.

209
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,562
Camel jockey left
a big box of boom-boom

210
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:12,810
under my jeep back in Kandahar.

211
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,765
You military?

212
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,332
Was.

213
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,791
Which one's your vehicle?

214
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,275
These two sleds right here.

215
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,051
That is, in between rides, anyhow.

216
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,882
Ain't much of a bag
to be hitchhiking with.

217
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,191
I travel light.

218
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,600
And you're just hoofing it out
here in the middle of nowhere?

219
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,936
I do have the right to see a little bit
of the country

220
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,438
I lost my hand for, don't I?

221
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,880
Why don't you tell me what
this is all about, officer.

222
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,922
We got a vehicle here without a driver,

223
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:43,373
and at present, you're
the only driver without a vehicle.

224
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,857
Hell, is that what this is all about?

225
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,796
Why didn't you say so?

226
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,010
Dirty hippie kid dropping
a deuce in the facilities.

227
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,623
Came in with that car
not two minutes ago.

228
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,459
Check it out.

229
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,329
What were you, army?

230
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,825
Hell no.

231
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,470
Corps.

232
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,595
Well, then.

233
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,369
Semper fi, brother.

234
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,034
What outfit were you?

235
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,855
196th.

236
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,238
196th?

237
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,500
Never heard of it.

238
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,317
Where they out of?

239
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,740
Hey, sarge!

240
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,174
What the hell, man? I didn't do nothing.

241
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,579
Found these in his knapsack, after
he said he had no car.

242
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,337
What?

243
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,327
Semper fi, brother.

244
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,969
Semper fi.

245
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,826
Stop stressing, it doesn't do any good.

246
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,906
Maybe you ought to start stressing,

247
00:15:57,964 --> 00:16:00,182
if they're going to put
a bullet in our heads.

248
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,789
They need us.

249
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,030
They need us to get that money.

250
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,657
I admire your optimism.

251
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,049
She's rolling, man.

252
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,804
I can feel it.

253
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,949
So you want to ruin
scofield's life. Well, get in line.

254
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,222
What are you really looking for?

255
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,707
Same as you...

256
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,421
Money.

257
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,239
Money? You want money?

258
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,665
Ten grand, how's that sound?

259
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,788
We do it right now, right
there on those floorboards.

260
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,084
Not in a thousand years.

261
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,060
Beat it then.

262
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,510
You got nothing else I need.

263
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,759
Typical man.

264
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,563
I'm talking about millions of
dollars, and you'd piss it away for sex.

265
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,771
That's right.

266
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,170
And I was hoping you wouldn't
let Michael outsmart you, too.

267
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,086
Scofield ain't outsmarting no one.

268
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,849
You think that tire
went flat by accident?

269
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,320
What are you offering?

270
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,149
I can find out where the money is.

271
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,379
He trusts me.

272
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,690
What do you want?

273
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,934
My fair share.

274
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,345
You find out where that money
is, your fair share is $200,000.

275
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:04,020
Out of five million? It's not even...

276
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,562
I got the gun, girl.

277
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,933
You're lucky you're a partner at all.

278
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,234
I'll be right back.

279
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,820
Fibonacci's in D.C.

280
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,220
Yeah, and he's in Denver,
Atlanta, Miami...

281
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,469
No, no, no.
This time, it's for real.

282
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,751
He's testifying again.

283
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,483
He's in Washington right now.

284
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,728
The Globe Hotel, room 116.

285
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,462
Is this information any good?

286
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:34,349
It's from New Jersey.

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,982
Fishhead Tommy wants to pay tribute.

288
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,456
Get the car.

289
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,282
Look at this room, John.

290
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,753
Look.

291
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,126
We can be a family again.

292
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,694
But you want to risk it all, disrespect
us, and for what, for vengeance?

293
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,700
- He betrayed me.
- I don't care.

294
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,253
He betrayed us.

295
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,812
I'm sorry you...

296
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,365
Will never understand what happens...

297
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,191
When you're in prison.

298
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,865
But you could go back to pris...

299
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,239
I swear to god...

300
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,230
I'd rather die than go back.

301
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,485
There's no going back,
never, ever again.

302
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,245
Christ saved you, John.

303
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,515
Don't turn your back on him.

304
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,954
Don't turn your back on us.

305
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,364
I...

306
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,561
I don't know,
about 20 miles from Gunnison.

307
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,302
He's coming, I have to go.

308
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,937
Who was that?

309
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,840
Nobody, it's just my father.

310
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,124
Hey, listen.

311
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,567
Do you mind
if we stop at the next motel?

312
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:19,890
It's only like 4:00?

313
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,899
Yeah, but we've been driving forever.

314
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,800
It's cool, I'll drive.

315
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,027
I really just want to stop.

316
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,829
- But if we get on the road now...
- Scott!

317
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:32,234
It's my car, and I'm
tired of being in it, okay?

318
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,884
All right.

319
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,912
<i>You heard about the call coming in?</i>

320
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,169
<i>Can you believe it?
Of all the players in this thing,</i>

321
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:46,227
it's the rat that could give us
our first collar. Come on.

322
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,123
You guys need to use the can, hold it.

323
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,258
If you need to tinkle, sweet
pea, I'll watch you any time.

324
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,248
Sit down.

325
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,814
Hands behind your back.

326
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,693
Took your time.

327
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,659
It takes time
to gain a man's confidence.

328
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,586
You're right.

329
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,224
He'll bite on anything I say.

330
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,431
You just tell me where we trap him,

331
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:28,650
and I'll tell him
that's where the money is.

332
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:51,281
Hey, you're the guy from
the gas station, right?

333
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,174
I'm the guy who was having car trouble.

334
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,044
Seems to be purring along now, huh?

335
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,445
Yeah.

336
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,085
Water pump.

337
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,784
200 bucks for this heap.

338
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,703
Well, they'll get you.

339
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,553
Look, I-I hope I'm not out of line,

340
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,750
but I heard you telling
the cop back there about your hand.

341
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,140
My old man was killed
in 'nam when I was a kid,

342
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,690
so I have the utmost respect
for our servicemen.

343
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,142
Just serving my country.

344
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,377
A lot of us are grateful for it.

345
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,112
Listen,
if you need a ride or something...

346
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,166
Well, to be honest with you, my...

347
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:30,924
My dogs are kind of barking.

348
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,052
Well, all right.

349
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,970
Jerry Curtin.

350
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,200
Clyde.

351
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,262
Clyde May.

352
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,340
My kid Danny's riding shotgun. I hope
you don't mind sitting in the back.

353
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,661
Hi. I'm Danielle.

354
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,428
Hi, yourself.

355
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,584
What do you want?

356
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,600
I need to use the bathroom.

357
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,681
Again?

358
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,662
I have a small bladder.

359
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,415
That ain't all you got.

360
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,324
Get up.

361
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,522
Well?

362
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,202
They plan to trap you.

363
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,040
The big one- he's got friends in Utah.

364
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:35,236
Criminals.

365
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,137
A town called Panguitch.

366
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,010
They grow drugs on the farm there.

367
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,370
They'll tell you that's where
the money is, but no money.

368
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,666
Just old friends with guns,
waiting for you.

369
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,297
Easy enough.

370
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,193
We take a pass on Panguitch.

371
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,102
Where's the money really?

372
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,317
I'll find out soon enough.

373
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,484
But $200,000 was old
price for this information.

374
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,237
I want a new price.

375
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,900
She's trying to renegotiate.

376
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,487
If it wasn't for me, you'd be
face down in a marijuana farm.

377
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,294
One third.

378
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,491
It's gonna take
a lot more than information

379
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,690
if you want a million-six, sweet pea.

380
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,166
Such as?

381
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,504
You know.

382
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,335
Piece of that can anytime I want it.

383
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,736
Is that it?

384
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:29,778
Aren't you gonna slap me?

385
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,696
I've slept with men
for a lot less, trust me.

386
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,370
And what happened to
"never in a 1,000 years?

387
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,280
" That was negotiating.

388
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,591
So.

389
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,803
Deal?

390
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,232
Deal.

391
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,940
We got a $150,000 here, John.

392
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,860
With Vittorio's place in Solanas, we'll
be able to live off the interest.

393
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,588
Where's your father?

394
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,810
Everything all right, boss?

395
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,600
Yeah.

396
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,960
Let's get this over with...

397
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,727
So I can get back to my family.

398
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,750
She'll get it done.

399
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:28,032
Nika and I have come too far together.

400
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:29,891
When money's on the line,
you trust no one.

401
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:31,088
Sometimes you have to.

402
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,920
Not if you want to survive, you don't.

403
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,080
You really don't trust anyone, do you?

404
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,810
Can you blame me
after all that's happened?

405
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,330
No, I mean before that. Before prison.

406
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,508
Every time I trusted someone,
I got burned.

407
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,214
Every time I got close
to someone, I got screwed.

408
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,465
I know better, and so should you.

409
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,990
That's right, the lotus motel.

410
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,340
I don't know the number.

411
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,490
I can't talk anymore; I have to go.

412
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:12,810
Oh, check it. I-

413
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,459
I know this might be a
little forward and all, but...

414
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:18,095
Let me ask you something.

415
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,702
You got a man?

416
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,830
I mean, a boyfriend?

417
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,350
What am I thinking? You're mormon...

418
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,880
I'm not mormon.

419
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,285
You think all girls
from Utah are mormons?

420
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,290
They are, aren't they?

421
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,589
Well, yo, hey. Yo,
then you can party, right?

422
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:45,011
When I land, I want 12 armed agents
waiting for me on the ground.

423
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,616
Tell them I want to go straight
to the motel from the airstrip.

424
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:48,657
You got it.

425
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,810
I was an ass before.

426
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,950
I apologize.

427
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,390
A little bit.

428
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,710
- It's all right.
- Here you go.

429
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,980
I was a huge ass.

430
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,610
I apologize.

431
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm not going to argue with you.

432
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,723
Well, I mean, what were the odds
that you were actually a doctor?

433
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,770
All right, fair enough.
They're probably not good, but...

434
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:20,984
And I should not have
interrupted you, and I'm sorry.

435
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm sorry, too.

436
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,250
Well, then, apologies accepted.

437
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,270
I recommend the blueberry pie.

438
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,410
Blueberry pie it is.

439
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,870
Hey, there, Danny.

440
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,114
Hey.

441
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,710
Sure is nice of your daddy to
buy me a room for the night.

442
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,430
Yeah, he's always helping
out with vets and stuff.

443
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,348
Good man.

444
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,895
But I was wishing we could
have kept going on toward Utah.

445
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:11,140
Lots of light left in the
day, lots of road to go.

446
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,848
When dad's back acts up, we stop.

447
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,274
Young miss?

448
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,445
That's kind of insulting, isn't it?

449
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:23,483
I mean, you're a grown woman.

450
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,818
But adults are always trying
to infantilize girls your age,

451
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,555
treat you like children.

452
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:36,310
No duh. My dad won't let
me get earrings, and I'm 14.

453
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,152
You see? That's what I'm saying.

454
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,010
You are more than
perfectly capable of...

455
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,595
- Of making your own decisions...
- Tell my dad that.

456
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:45,562
Yeah, but he won't want
to hear it, right?

457
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,321
Because he wants to keep you as a baby.

458
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:53,568
Right?

459
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:55,475
Even though you're...

460
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,735
You're more than old enough

461
00:27:58,318 --> 00:28:02,673
to choose how you wanna dress, or...

462
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:05,022
accessorize.

463
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,783
- What are you doing?
- Just in need of a friend,

464
00:28:07,822 --> 00:28:09,789
- No. No. I'm telling my dad.
- that's all...

465
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,230
Wait!

466
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:20,628
She's got it all wrong.

467
00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:23,712
Go wait outside.

468
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,930
You and I are gonna work this out.

469
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,340
Jerry...

470
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,713
You really don't want to do this.

471
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:48,450
Thing I like about you
is your determination.

472
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,070
I've got family in Kladno that have
been waiting for me to send for them.

473
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,347
They know what kind of work you're in?

474
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,709
They think I work at Starbuck's.

475
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,411
How stupid do you think I am?

476
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,200
My daddy always said,"fool
me once, shame on you.

477
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,030
Fool me twice,
and I put you in the ground.

478
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,220
" Any more games, and I stop
the hooker's air, understand?

479
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,602
Thanks for the dance, sweet pea.

480
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,300
You bitch!

481
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,490
Fooled you.

482
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,248
I carried it; the cons can change it.

483
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:01,736
Oh, you really suck, Bellick,
you know that?

484
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,940
Roll 'em.

485
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,214
Let's go.

486
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,880
Put your hands behind your back.

487
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:16,138
Thank you.

488
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,680
You're as stupid as the
prison doc, you know that?

489
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,998
Ignore him.

490
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:23,095
He conned her, too. Made her think
he loved her, and look what she got.

491
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:25,761
An overdose
and a shot at 30 years inside.

492
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,647
What are you talking about?

493
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,020
Guess you haven't been reading
the papers, have you, college boy?

494
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,530
Cops found your girlfriend-
fish-belly white, garglin' her own puke.

495
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,450
Shut up.

496
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,770
But what do you care, a long as
she left the door open for you?

497
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,854
Shut up!

498
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,619
Hit a sore spot, didn't I?

499
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,762
Dad...

500
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,952
It really is like the
best pie I've ever had.

501
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,997
You know what it needs though...

502
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,590
Some crack.

503
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,750
No, I mean, you know, not a lot.

504
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,796
A pinch.

505
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,940
- A pinch of crack?
- A pinch of crack.

506
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,000
A pinch of crack, a dollop of smack.

507
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,760
That's good pie.

508
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,560
That's so wrong.

509
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,744
No?

510
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,129
I'm sorry.

511
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:45,512
Hello.

512
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:46,554
<i>Sara...</i>

513
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,660
<i>It's me.</i>

514
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,160
What do you want?

515
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,638
I don't have time to talk.

516
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,270
And there's every chance they're
listening to this call right now,

517
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,270
<i>But there's a lot I want to say.</i>

518
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,680
Please don't hang up on me.

519
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,050
I don't...
I don't want to talk to you.

520
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,440
<i>I heard about...</i>

521
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,474
I heard about what happened.

522
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,298
I want you to know that...

523
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:17,030
I want you to know how sorry I am...

524
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,145
For everything.

525
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,465
Sorry's not going to do me
a whole lot of good

526
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:23,181
with what I'm up against right now.

527
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,262
<i>Listen...</i>

528
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:30,210
Anyone with any ties to me and
my brother is in danger now.

529
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,440
I have no ties to you
and your brother anymore.

530
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,352
There is a way I can protect you.

531
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,082
It's already in your possession.

532
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,870
What are you talking about?

533
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,319
I was real, Sara.

534
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,248
You and me...

535
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,749
It's real.

536
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,634
Michael?

537
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,706
Michael?

538
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,960
How long to the motel?

539
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,750
Approximately ten minutes, sir.

540
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,210
Let's make it five?

541
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:22,590
Yo, I haven't taken a
shower like that in forever!

542
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,032
Where are you going?

543
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,940
I was going to surprise you.

544
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,233
Surprise me how?

545
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,485
I was going to get
some tequila and limes.

546
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:31,990
All right, well, hold up-

547
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
No, no. No, it'll only take a minute.

548
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:36,357
Stay here and relax.

549
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,619
You seem kind of nervous.

550
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,110
I do?

551
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:41,927
Yeah, you're sweating.

552
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,992
Maybe I am nervous.

553
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,320
Trust me, girl, you got nothing
to worry about, all right?

554
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,482
I'm one of the good guys.

555
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,504
You seem like it.

556
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:30,750
Hang on tight.

557
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,520
I had the manager unlock the door.

558
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:33,630
Gotcha.

559
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,285
<i>If you're looking for the rat, John...</i>

560
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,879
Fibonacci's 2,000 miles from here.

561
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,159
Who are you?

562
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,508
Local cops or feds?

563
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,590
Feds, John, only roll out the
best for a man of your stature.

564
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,700
I deserve to know who turned on me.

565
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,027
Tell me.

566
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,852
The man was facing a RICO rap.

567
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,024
<i>He did not want to go to prison.</i>

568
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,436
I'm sure you can appreciate that,

569
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,384
knowing
what you know about the place now.

570
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,780
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, John...

571
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:57,758
Don't.

572
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:05,184
You are going back to Fox
River today, or the morgue...

573
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:06,575
That's your call.

574
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:14,719
Coming out.

575
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:17,110
Weapons comes out first, John.

576
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:20,186
Forgive me.

577
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,304
Yeah,

578
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,547
I'm coming out.

579
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,780
Easy, John.

580
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,803
Easy.

581
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,770
We got a weapon, right hand.

582
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,337
These are serious men here.

583
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,608
They have instructions to shoot at
the first sign of aggression. Please.

584
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,720
I'm asking you, respectfully.

585
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,547
Drop the weapon, kneel and
put your hands on your head.

586
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,602
I kneel only to God.

587
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,962
I don't see him here.

588
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,064
John!

589
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,154
I think I screwed up.

590
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,425
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

591
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:39,238
Total nazi.

592
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:41,862
One of those
nightmare overprotective dads.

593
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,731
Yeah?

594
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:45,941
Well, I called him.

595
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:50,232
Told him I was traveling with you.

596
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:53,559
I told him that we were
staying in the same hotel room.

597
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,157
Girl.

598
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,262
What?

599
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,540
You got to learn how to
lie, girl. What you thinking?

600
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,200
Yeah, I- for some reason
I don't know how.

601
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,790
He was mad enough when I told him I
was staying in a hotel room with a guy,

602
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,407
- That was one thing...
- Yeah, yeah.

603
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,100
But when I told him I was staying
in a hotel with a guy that...

604
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:16,838
I maybe sort of liked...

605
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:19,268
He lost it.

606
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,540
Wait.

607
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:26,290
Wait, what?

608
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,738
Is that okay?

609
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,510
At least let us take you into town.

610
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,294
No.

611
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,258
If I'm seen with you, it's
a lot of trouble for me.

612
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,795
I can walk, it's only a mile.

613
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,358
We never would've made
it this far without you.

614
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,010
But now you're crossing the border.

615
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,010
Without me.

616
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,068
You can't go where we're going.

617
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,306
It's not a life for you.

618
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,662
Then that's it then.

619
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,004
It's over for good.

620
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,775
Thank you.

621
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,050
Be safe.

622
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,324
Good luck.

623
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,077
I loved you, Michael.

624
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,931
And I thought I was going to get
that back, but you just used me.

625
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,499
- That's not true.
- I deserve more than this.

626
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,109
I deserve more than just being the girl

627
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:48,010
that you call when you need something.

628
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:50,394
You really think you're
gonna find the money in Utah?

629
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:52,420
I don't care about the money in Utah!

630
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,662
I don't want any more crime.

631
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,652
I turn you in, I get $200,000.

632
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,462
Legal money.

633
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,310
You're the policemen's problem now.

634
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,550
Nika...

635
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,707
Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you!

636
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,141
No, you won't.

637
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,145
Good luck to you.

638
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,433
Hey.

639
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,913
H.Q. called.

640
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:18,231
They're asking
why you didn't intercept Abruzzi

641
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:20,174
when he was walking towards the motel.

642
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:24,090
The man was a mob boss. The right
move was to get him trapped.

643
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,585
They're saying the way you played
it, there was only one possible outcome.

644
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:29,464
H.Q. has a problem
with the way I do things,

645
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:32,141
they can pick up a gun
and follow me into the field next time.

646
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,151
Scofield always knew the
rat was the key to Abruzzi.

647
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:45,437
We just put it out on
the wire and Abruzzi bit.

648
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,506
Speaking of Scofield...

649
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,633
The crash was staged.

650
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,338
Pig blood.

651
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,700
Smart kid.

652
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,909
The problem with

653
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,557
being that clever
is that sooner or later,

654
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:23,870
you end up getting too clever
for your own good.

655
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,100
Good night.

656
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,155
You've no idea what you're in for.

657
