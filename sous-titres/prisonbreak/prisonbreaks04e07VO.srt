 <i>Previously on</i> Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,962
These are GPS ankle monitors.

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,215
Now, step up, take one and put it on.

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,883
When the exchange is over,

5
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,219
you and I are gonna spend some quality time.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,553
These aren't release papers.

7
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,180
I did the best I could do.

8
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,599
You need to sign those 
so I can collect Roland's device.

9
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:19,228
You want me to give up the one thing
that makes me valuable to the team.

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,562
Hey, you knew the deal when you came onboard.

11
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,273
Do you want to flush it down the toilet
because you made a bad move?

12
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,610
This man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,195
I don't recognize him.

14
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,240
If you do see him, would you please give us a call?

15
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,908
You don't work for the IRS?

16
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,534
I don't.

17
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,576
Who do you work for?

18
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,662
As of now... myself.

19
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,747
I'm an associate of General Krantz.

20
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,083
The general, he likes his privacy.

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,674
I knew you were rotten from the beginning,

22
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,425
so I want you to walk me through this

23
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,470
and if you can't, I'm gonna call the authorities.

24
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,430
Cole Pfeiffer.

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,310
Who the hell are you?

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,833
The last time
a pretty little filly like yourself

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,378
knocked me senseless and tied me to a chair,

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,963
I had to pay for it.

29
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,299
You still might.

30
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,012
That book was a gift
from a very dear friend of mine

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,723
who left this realm all too soon.

32
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,852
The only thing that James Whistler ever gave anybody
was the clap.

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,694
You have 30 seconds to tell me something
that I don't already know.

34
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,865
I followed that book from Panama City,

35
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,536
where James Whistler and I were co-incarcerated,

36
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,455
to a bus locker in San Diego.

37
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,999
Inside was information pertaining to this apartment...

38
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,793
Scylla.

39
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,379
How about that?
That ring a bell, huh? Huh?

40
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,341
What do you know about Scylla?

41
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,801
I know I'm holding the keys,

42
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:21,099
because without me, that bird book's
about as meaningful as a fart in a wind storm.

43
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,435
I commandeered Whistler's alias.

44
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,941
I infiltrated his place of business
because it's the gateway to the whole damn thing.

45
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,318
Where's the location?

46
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,489
What do you bring to the jamboree, darling, huh?

47
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,742
Aside from those baby blues
and a knife?

48
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,541
This is me.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,794
This is Scylla.

50
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,881
This is you.

51
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,219
I am gonna get Scylla.

52
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,889
And it can either be with you...

53
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,226
...or through you.

54
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,441
So why don't you give me
that informed decision right now,

55
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,611
before I spill your hillbilly guts all over the carpet?

56
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,575
'Cause you're messing with the wrong bitch.

57
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,831
How may I be of service?

58
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,877
This is unbelievable.

59
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,422
We were planning our move
on Scuderi when he chartered the flight. Right.

60
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,758
And no chance you dragged your feet a little bit
waiting for Scuderi to charter the flight?

61
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,427
Oh, yeah, we want to drag this out.

62
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,345
Yeah, well, location's pretty convenient, wouldn't you say, Linc?

63
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,222
ROLAND: Uh, Scuderi splitting town

64
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,016
kind of caught us a break, huh?

65
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,642
Would you shut him up?

66
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,186
No, no.

67
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,981
We could just wait till he comes back.
AgriSow makes farm chemicals.

68
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:51,982
It's not Fort Knox.

69
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,108
You want to bet?

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,818
Their patents are worth billions.

71
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,321
Which is why companies tend to keep a very close eye

72
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,655
on those patents.

73
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,450
Yeah, we could breach their security,
in a week, minimum. We could get

74
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,202
in the guy's house-- week, minimum.

75
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,287
Or we could follow the guys for 12 hours out of town

76
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,206
and have card five by midnight. How's that sound?

77
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,749
How does this sound?

78
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,168
If you're not back by midnight you're going to jail.

79
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,461
Yeah, don't I know it.

80
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,546
Let's talk outside.

81
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,510
So what's the plan?

82
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,971
We're going to Vegas.

83
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,516
Oh, hell yes!

84
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,017
Yo, I call shotgun!

85
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,227
Huh? Who's got-- Hey.

86
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,487
So what do you want to talk about, Agent Self?

87
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,780
I've been a part of hundreds

88
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,573
of operations during my career--

89
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,950
and I'll tell you one thing.

90
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,910
I never been on the top of someone else's hit list.

91
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,662
What are you talking about? What am I talking about?

92
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,163
If this Company hit man Wyatt

93
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,165
can find me once, it's only a matter of time

94
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,584
until he creeps up in the back of my rearview mirror again.

95
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,253
Well, that's not true.

96
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,047
'Cause you'll never see him coming at all
if he's coming after you. Yeah.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,882
That's comforting.

98
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,050
What do you think, I want that?

99
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,052
You're dead, we're all back in jail.

100
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,680
You were an agent longer than me.

101
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,098
What's my play here?

102
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,434
Let me get this straight. You turn your back

103
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,936
on me and now you want to know my play

104
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,646
That was your fault.

105
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,649
What would you have done?

106
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:26,201
I've tracked down rapists, killers,
even former military,

107
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,204
but a structural engineer from Illinois was able to get to me.

108
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,247
Want to know how?

109
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,584
Yeah, I want to know.
He stopped running.

110
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,461
He got aggressive.

111
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,464
He took the game to me.
That's your play.

112
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,843
That's your only play.

113
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,563
I shouldn't have to remind you that killing a federal agent

114
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:59,234
is a complicated matter-- even in our line of work.

115
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:03,405
Perhaps Mahone is just
the tip of the iceberg.

116
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,115
We've been searching for the link between

117
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,868
SuperMax and Burrows and Scofield.

118
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,953
I believe we found it.

119
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,747
If Scofield and Burrows are working with the government,

120
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,415
we've got a much bigger problem

121
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,792
than one bureaucrat at Homeland Security.

122
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,713
But it begins with that bureaucrat.

123
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,800
And if Don Self is the head of the snake...

124
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,846
Make it look like an accident.

125
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,688
My fee just doubled, by the way.

129
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,520
- Hello?
- Uh, hi, is this Brad?

130
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,855
Yeah.

131
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,315
Uh, you came by my office a couple of days ago

132
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,568
looking for a guy who had an inheritance coming to him.

133
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,278
Right.

134
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,822
I know where he is.

135
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,451
She wants two grand first.
I'm meeting her at noon.

136
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,828
Okay, the next card's more important, right?

137
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,746
So Vegas first, then we deal with T-Bag.

138
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,873
Shut up!

139
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,250
MAHONE: I'll stay.

140
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,460
All right.

141
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,131
Linc, take, uh,

142
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,926
Sara and Sucre...
...Roland to Vegas.

143
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,763
The rest of us...
...will handle T-Bag

144
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,185
You heard the man, let's go.

145
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,319
...promise me something, would you?

146
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,403
Yeah.

147
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,324
Can you get me Carrot Top's autograph?

148
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:14,703
'Cause I just think
that would make this whole thing worthwhile.

149
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,330
Be safe.

150
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,423
Ay, yo, Vegas, bitches!

151
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,722
He should have the info by now.

152
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,351
Okay, what the hell's taking Bellick so long?

153
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,605
- Yes.
- She wants more money.

154
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,941
- How much more?
- I don't know.

155
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,943
You got to come talk to this chick.

156
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,577
Hold on, hold on.

157
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,915
What's going on, Bellick?

158
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,085
Believe it.

159
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,253
MAHONE: What happened, Brad?

160
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,380
Sorry, guys, I walked right into it, too.

161
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,215
It's okay. Go. Go! Come on, now!

162
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,760
BELLICK: You have no idea who you're working with, honey.

163
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,595
MAHONE: There's only one way this can end, Bagwell.

164
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,847
Why don't we skip the theatrics

165
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,390
and you just tell us what you want.

166
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,602
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.

167
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,772
Time's up.
Him, too.

168
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,986
Let's all get in the van.

169
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,365
Let's all get in the van now.

170
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,409
You, too, Mahone.

171
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,725
＃I remember the day we met, Pretty.

172
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:14,231
You were a scared little college boy
sittin' up on those bleachers,

173
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,733
tryin' to keep your ass out of the game.

174
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,944
Now look at you.

175
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,363
Cold. Hard.

176
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:24,199
Like a dried up flower
wanting to get watered.

177
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:25,659
Just tell me what you want.

178
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:28,537
I want to make you bleed.

179
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,455
I want to release the sinner inside of me

180
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:33,792
that got me incarcerated so many years ago.

181
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:44,261
But it seems
you caught yourself a break, Pretty.

182
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,929
I need you.

183
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,723
Now...

184
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,726
you gonna cooperate right quick or so help me

185
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,894
I'm gonna stomp you till you can't stand.

186
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,274
The pages-- look at them.

187
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:59,943
Looks like some kind of map, right? I don't know.

188
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,236
You know enough to chase me down

189
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,487
looking for this.

190
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,239
Now don't lie to me, Pretty.

191
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,450
Whatever's in that book-- it is bigger than you and me.

192
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:08,827
What, like Scylla big?

193
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,580
This is not a game, Theodore.

194
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:14,624
Now, you need to tell me who you've been talking to.

195
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,925
I don't need to do a damn thing.

196
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,599
That's the benefit of being the man with the gun.

197
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:36,438
You're going to write down everything

198
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:39,024
you already know about Scylla,

199
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,193
and everything you learn from that book...

200
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:49,659
...or I'm going to paint these walls

201
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,328
with your gray matter.

202
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,959
Get to work!

203
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,757
All right. I'll be right there.

204
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:57,102
Self.

205
00:12:57,185 --> 00:13:00,188
Hey. Michael's position
hasn't changed since you called.

206
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:01,022
How do we know he...?

207
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,316
Bagwell's a psychopath,
but he's a psychopath with a plan.

208
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,111
He obviously needs something from Michael,
and as long as Michael doesn't give it to him,

209
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:07,571
he'll keep breathing.

210
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,740
All right. I'm coming with you.

211
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,700
No, no, no, no. I got it.

212
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:13,452
Stick to the plan.

213
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,887
ROLAND:  Will you forget about Maricruz?

214
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,806
You think she didn't know
her sister was trying to set you up, man?

215
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,308
You better get some ass in Vegas, bro.

216
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,018
We're here to copy the card.

217
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,895
Then we leave. Got it?

218
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,318
Have you heard from Michael?

219
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,487
No. Why?

220
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,822
Nothing. I want this thing done.

221
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,991
Vegas ain't my town.

222
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,117
What a fool, huh?

223
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,953
How could anyone not love this place, right?

224
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:00,957
Check this out. Right there.

225
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,584
The Asian guy.

226
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:05,295
I know I've seen him someplace before.

227
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,446
So what do you have for me?

228
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,698
So what's "GATE"?

229
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:34,116
Excuse me?

230
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,534
It's on that box.

231
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,496
Why do you want to know? Just curious.

232
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:44,292
What if I was to tell you
I think you're just stalling?

233
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:47,421
Biding time till you can figure out some MacGyver way

234
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,631
to get your ass out of here, huh? I'd say you've got that gun

235
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,258
pointed at the one person who can help you.

236
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,510
So why don't you stop wasting my time?

237
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:04,730
TRISHANNE: Please, don't let him!

238
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,859
How 'bout her, Michael?

239
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,694
Any reason why I shouldn't kill her?

240
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:14,740
Let's do a test.

241
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:16,825
No!

242
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,330
How far gone is Michael Scofield?

243
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,207
Michael, just tell him what he wants!

244
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,921
How far gone is Michael Scofield?!

245
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,215
Please, don't let him. Please!

246
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,343
When did it happen, Michael?

247
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:36,928
Please, don't let him...

248
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,723
When did you stop caring about hurting people, huh?

249
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:41,349
Fox River? Sona?

250
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,437
You gonna keep dragging
your feet while I put a bullet in her brain?

251
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,272
Why don't you put that gun down.

252
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:49,941
I'll put it down when you start writing down, Pretty!

0
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:51,941
Let her go!
Come on，T-Bag，let her go!

253
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:53,528
Last chance. Three!

254
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:54,696
Two! One...

255
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,031
All right! All right!

256
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,374
The pages, they fit together.

257
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:08,085
But it's not a map.

258
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:10,629
It's a blueprint.

259
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,964
For what?

260
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,946
Our friend, Bellick, is wearing

261
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,739
a government-issued ankle monitor.

262
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:40,325
My guess is that Scofield has one, too.

263
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,995
I knew that son of a bitch was slow-walking me.

264
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,500
Any minute, federal agents could come
blasting through that door.

265
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,001
So what do we do?

266
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:53,422
I need you to get the make and serial number of that monitor.

267
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,090
Feel free to pitch in here, Miss Daisy .

268
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:57,592
If Scofield knows I'm involved, this is over.

269
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:59,052
We need to keep him on point.

270
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:00,762
Now, get out there and get that information.

271
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,017
What about the agents?

272
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,937
Let 'em come.

273
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:37,924
How do we even know this guy's out gambling?

274
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:40,594
The guy's got $300,000 in credit and a comped room.

275
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:41,845
He's here. Keep looking.

276
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,346
Hey, Sara.

277
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,849
Hey, uh, I realize this might not be the best time for this,

278
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,350
but I still haven't heard from Michael.

279
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:48,685
They must be dealing with T-Bag.

280
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:50,896
Lincoln, come on. What?

281
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,522
Vegas just isn't your town?

282
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:55,692
From everything I've heard about you,
that would be a pretty big change of pace.

283
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,235
I guess so.

284
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,821
Lincoln, please talk to me.

285
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,824
Has Michael told you about Mom?

286
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,201
No.

287
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,660
They were much alike.

288
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:08,288
They got the same mind.

289
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,499
As Mom got older, she started to lose it.

290
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,878
We, uh, later found out
it was a symptom of a brain tumor, hama...

291
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,338
Hamartoma. Yeah.

292
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:19,091
As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

293
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,217
They stopped.

294
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,095
In her 30s, they started up again.

295
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,597
She later died of a brain aneurysm.

296
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,724
And you're telling me this, because Michael and his mother

297
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:29,726
are similar in that way, too, right?

298
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:33,105
He got nosebleeds as a kid.

299
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:37,025
They stopped, and the last couple of days
they started up again.

300
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,445
How old was your mom when she passed away?

301
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,863
Thirty-one.

302
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:46,451
Michael's just turned 31.

303
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,958
I found him.

304
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,543
Keep an eye on him.

305
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,295
Okay.

306
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:11,912
＃Andrew Blauner?

307
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:14,206
Uh, yeah.

308
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,583
Can I help you?

309
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,086
I hope so.

310
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:27,761
Any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?

311
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,596
No.

312
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,226
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

313
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,228
No.

314
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,694
I'm giving you one more...

315
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,532
What is all this?

316
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,953
You okay?

317
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,998
They told me not to talk to you.

318
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,628
"They"? Who's they?

319
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,630
This is Whistler's blueprint.

320
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,882
It's the building where we can find Scylla.

321
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:09,261
In other words, it's GATE.

322
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:11,930
Where's Scylla?

323
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:14,725
I can't be certain until I see the building itself,

324
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:17,602
but I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here, below this office.

325
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:19,730
What is Scylla?

326
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:21,481
It's The Company's little black book.

327
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:24,609
I want you to take me to GATE, now.

328
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,319
Ah.

329
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:32,409
Because you can smell that Scylla money, can't you?

330
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:36,830
That's what you're in it for, just like me.

331
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:41,168
Say it.

332
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:42,502
Come on.

333
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,129
I want you to say it.

334
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,428
I'm in it for the money.

335
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,766
You see?

336
00:21:57,392 --> 00:22:00,145
We ain't so different after all.

337
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,199
Yes?

338
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:56,284
Don Self is not at his house.

339
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:58,328
Looks like he cleared out.

340
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,124
Notify our people inside the Bureau and LAPD.

341
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,294
I doubt that he could have gotten very far.

342
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:07,963
Sir?

343
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:09,256
Not now.

344
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:12,467
Don Self is here to see you.

345
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,197
Got to warn you, friend, she's cold.

346
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:51,423
Good luck, pal.

347
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,639
Stay with him.

348
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,948
Scofield's really getting somewhere in there.

349
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,325
Man works fast.

350
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:19,910
Says he can't get any further

351
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:21,995
without seeing my former place of employment.

352
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,915
Did you take care of our little troll problem?

353
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,797
Don't even think about doing this to me.

354
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,048
My name's on the door.

355
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:36,843
If I didn't think you were valuable,
you'd be dead already.

356
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:46,395
It's-It's just a little sensory overload, guys.

357
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:48,063
There just wasn't any room for the card.

358
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,481
Right. Because if we turn the device on

359
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:52,484
in the casino, it fills up on all the data from the slots.

360
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,530
Like when they're about to pay out.

361
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:58,824
Oh, it's completely unintentional. Really?

362
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,326
Yeah. It's not why you built the damn thing in the first place?

363
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,537
If we didn't need you...

364
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,040
But you do, so just take a brewski and chill, all right?

365
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:09,543
Okay, we need to figure out a way to get Scuderi alone.

366
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:13,714
Yeah.

367
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:16,216
The old man just showed up at the pool.

368
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,594
From what he's wearing, there's no way
he's got the card on him.

369
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:20,846
Stay with him.

370
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:24,516
Card's in his room.

371
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:32,691
Tell me, Donald,

372
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:35,193
how did you play this moment out in your head?

373
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:37,904
Did you picture yourself coming in here,

374
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:40,157
chest out, jaw squared,

375
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,783
ready to demand answers?

376
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:45,203
Did you at any time in your fantasy

377
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:47,748
imagine that you would be this nervous?

378
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,710
Honestly, I, uh... I didn't think much past

379
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,211
giving you these.

380
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,220
Berlin. Nigeria.

381
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,264
The Comrie Group.

382
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:09,436
Why not JFK
and the Lindbergh baby while you're at it?

383
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,522
Son,
those matters have been fully vetted.

384
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:13,899
They're relics.

385
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:16,401
I had nothing to do with them, and if

386
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:18,445
this is why you've been pulling data on me,

387
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:20,197
I could have saved you a lot of trouble.

388
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,825
Okay. Well, these records
and a sealed letter explaining my investigation

389
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:25,786
into your involvement with these matters

390
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:28,372
was sent to five lawyers
across the country.

391
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:29,706
If anything happens to me,

392
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,168
if I go missing, anything, if I wind up dead,

393
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:34,753
that letter is to be unsealed...

394
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:38,298
And they will find cold trails that lead nowhere near me.

395
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:39,466
It doesn't matter.

396
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:42,803
If a government agent
who was looking into you is found floating

397
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:45,138
in the L.A. River, or whatever else you have planned,

398
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:47,224
your life, General, will change dramatically.

399
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:50,894
There will be questions, media coverage and surveillance,

400
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,438
and whatever you and the Company are trying to do next

401
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:54,606
with your little Laos game,

402
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,441
or whatever else you have planned,

403
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:59,319
it'll be next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you.

404
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:01,113
Okay? So back off of me.

405
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:07,661
You are not the first person to attempt something
like this.

406
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:11,123
Most of the others I now fondly call my colleagues.

407
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:13,333
They've learned to put

408
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:16,420
their determination and focus to better use,

409
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:18,964
and with far greater compensation.

410
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,632
Wrong guy.

411
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,969
We'll see.

412
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,096
"Dear Mr. White, due to unforeseen circumstances,

413
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:29,224
"I regret to inform you that I will no longer be able

414
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:30,517
"to perform services at GATE.

415
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,102
"I thank you for this opportunity.

416
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:33,353
"I'm deeply sorry

417
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:35,397
"if this places you in a difficult position.

418
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,025
"I have simply not been able to escape these circumstances.

419
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,860
Thank you for the wonderful, enriching opportunity..."

420
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,946
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

421
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,823
Does it sound like you?

422
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:47,034
Yeah.

423
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:48,452
Good. Yeah.

424
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:50,370
Look,

425
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:53,165
I don't even know who you are, okay?

426
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:54,291
Just let me go...

427
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:55,500
Shut up.

428
00:27:57,377 --> 00:27:59,337
And you wondered

429
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:03,967
how I got to be the top salesman in the northeast region.

430
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,302
Sorry, okay?

431
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:08,805
Sorry.

432
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:11,349
Consider this a warning.

433
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:27,741
Old Teddy Bagwell

434
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:30,118
may be Coosa County trash,

435
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:32,204
but Cole Pfeiffer's a man of refinement.

436
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:35,290
One of the Gate Corporation's

437
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:37,417
tippy-top sellers, as a matter of fact.

438
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:41,505
Step into my office.

439
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,095
Well, there should be a room-- eight by ten.

440
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:50,597
Whistler's point of entry.

441
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:51,973
That's a closet.

442
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,644
No, it's not.

443
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:09,800
#Tonic and lime, please.
Sure.

444
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:13,637
I'm in the middle of this nightmare.

445
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,222
I wonder if you could help me.

446
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:20,894
It's my 22-year-old cousin's bachelorette party.

447
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:23,314
That's hardly the salt mines.

448
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:25,065
Wait for it.

449
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:27,818
There's a scavenger hunt,

450
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:30,029
and my team has tasked me

451
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,573
with getting a photograph in a whale's suite.

452
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:35,784
I'm a whale?

453
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:40,706
With a very scary bodyguard
and a very gorgeous watch.

454
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,500
And you want to take a picture in my room?

455
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,711
And I realize it's a completely inappropriate request,

456
00:29:45,794 --> 00:29:48,005
but they're already calling me a wet blanket.

457
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:49,923
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:53,302
I just can't help you.

459
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:54,595
What if I said "please"?

460
00:29:54,637 --> 00:29:56,555
I'm actually a little desperate.

461
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:59,224
Best of luck.

462
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:04,188
Drinks are on the gentleman.

463
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:06,065
Have a nice day.

464
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,651
You, too.

465
00:30:10,861 --> 00:30:12,780
Don't take it personally.

466
00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:14,031
You're not his type.

467
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:16,200
Right before you sat down,

468
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:19,328
he asked me if I liked to party.

469
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:23,248
-Absolutely not! No way!
-Oh, come on.

470
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:24,416
Take one for the team.

471
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,584
Maricruz will never know.

472
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:26,919
I'm gonna snap his neck.

473
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:27,836
Get to his room, stay two minutes, then leave, all right?

474
00:30:27,878 --> 00:30:28,712
Get to his room, stay two minutes, then leave, all right?

475
00:30:28,796 --> 00:30:31,131
Yeah, yeah, and in the meantime, what? In the elevator?

476
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:32,967
Just play hard to get, you know, and then let him nuzzle

477
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,842
a little bit. Whoa, whoa...!

478
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:35,928
Hey, whoa! What option we got?

479
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,221
Come on, man. What option we got?

480
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,056
Give me one.

481
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:41,100
You can't. Here.

482
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,240
Go ahead. There's nothing back there.

483
00:30:57,533 --> 00:31:00,035
I know.

484
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:19,263
Do we have anything sharp?

485
00:31:31,108 --> 00:31:34,236
So, what are you hearing, uh, Scylla is worth, huh?

486
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,906
Me, I'm hearing

487
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:39,199
millions.

488
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:44,204
Is that a rough ballpark

489
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:47,291
in terms of what you, uh... what you've been told?

490
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,436
What do we have here?

491
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:11,357
Go ahead, back up.

492
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,307
You and me and a dark hole.

493
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:49,687
Just like old times, Pretty, you first.

494
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,620
How are the chips falling for you?

495
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:51,915
Spent my last buck on the beer.

496
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:56,295
What are the options when you're broke in Vegas?

497
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:00,591
I guess I got to work that out, huh?

498
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:06,055
What if you didn't have to?

499
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:09,642
I may have a little business
to throw your way.

500
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,062
What kind?

501
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:20,110
The easy kind...

502
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:22,821
with a $1,000 payout.

503
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,367
What's your cognac?

504
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,161
I've never had it.

505
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:32,998
I've got a 200-year-old bottle in my suite.

506
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,500
Join me.

507
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,336
This is private business.

508
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,547
Between men.

509
00:34:55,062 --> 00:34:56,689
They're on their way up.

510
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,190
Get ready.

511
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:00,901
I love it-- Mr. Macho Man.

512
00:35:11,787 --> 00:35:13,956
What's next?

513
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:16,041
I don't know, why don't you figure it out?

514
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,043
I'm done helping you.

515
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:23,590
Sounds like someone's caught
in the old captivity of negativity.

516
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:25,884
Let's get you in a more affirmative mindset.

517
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:27,219
What's next?

518
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,597
I think I'm gonna lock you in this room.

519
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:35,227
And then, you're gonna be arrested
and taken back to Fox River.

520
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,565
Just how do you plan on...

521
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,660
Stop, y'all have no idea what you're doing.

522
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:53,579
Scofield, you can't do this without me.

523
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:54,955
Self's on his way.

524
00:35:54,997 --> 00:35:56,123
Mark my words!

525
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:57,791
Got your message.

526
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,461
Y'all have no idea
what you're doing!

527
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,255
Thanks, Alex.

528
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,428
Great city.

529
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,971
I guess so.

530
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,098
That's the thing about Vegas.

531
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:14,850
Doesn't judge you.

532
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:18,604
Any form of pleasure is acceptable here.

533
00:36:26,862 --> 00:36:30,949
Am I crazy, or is there a note of plum in there?

534
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:35,245
Maybe.

535
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,247
Have a seat.

536
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,459
Did you serve?

537
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,419
Serve who?

538
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:43,963
In the military.

539
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:47,091
You look like a Devil Dog.

540
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:50,636
No, sir, I've never been in the service before.

541
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,309
Filling up nice.

542
00:36:57,393 --> 00:36:59,311
Sucre must be in close proximity.

543
00:36:59,395 --> 00:37:01,146
Getting oiled, most likely.

544
00:37:07,403 --> 00:37:08,862
One and half tours in Vietnam.

545
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:11,490
Purple Heart

546
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:14,368
in a friendly fire exchange near Hue.

547
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,371
Sorry to hear it.

548
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:29,550
What I learned at Hue,

549
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:35,306
though valuable, also cost me
a great deal.

550
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,058
Specifically...

551
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,186
three square inches of upper groin thigh meat.

552
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:44,523
And with that...

553
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:48,694
my reproductive and sexual function.

554
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:55,701
So... so you can't...

555
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:58,537
Mr. Villalobos, I'd like you to meet my wife.

556
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,875
I'm Alexa.

557
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,088
You want me to bang your wife?

558
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:10,088
Then I'll pay you 1,000 dollars.

559
00:38:29,835 --> 00:38:32,463
#He's got a minute.
Then I'm going after him.

560
00:38:33,964 --> 00:38:36,091
Did it copy the card?
ROLAND: Yep.

561
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:39,928
All right, download that.
You got five minutes.

562
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:43,891
Well?

563
00:38:43,932 --> 00:38:45,309
His wife was up there.

564
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:47,770
And...?

565
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:51,315
It stays in Vegas.

566
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:00,616
Uh, hey, guys.

567
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,826
I'm gonna go hit the head, and I'll be out

568
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:04,161
in a minute, all right?

569
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:15,172
Yes.

570
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,927
Two... two... two pulls.

571
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,821
Two pulls, and he won the progressive.

572
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:41,323
SARA:  Where the hell is he?

573
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:43,367
I'll go get him.

574
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:58,257
Mr. Glenn.

575
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,217
We got a problem.

576
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,262
It was made clear
you were never again welcome

577
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:05,264
in any Nevada gaming establishment.

578
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:07,266
Wait, wait, uh, I was told there was only a five-year...

579
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:09,518
No such thing was said to you.

580
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:14,940
What's that do? It's a battery pack
for a video game console.

581
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:20,696
You'll need to buy a new one.

582
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,997
I already downloaded the card onto my laptop,

583
00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:32,958
and... and I can build another device.

584
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,293
You said this one takes months.

585
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:35,294
We don't have months.

586
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:36,336
You know what?

587
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:39,047
We ought to leave your ass in the desert.

588
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:41,508
Let's get him back to L.A., and let Self sort him out.

589
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:43,552
Let's go.

590
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:12,539
For a little guy, he has some set of lungs.

591
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,500
How's Bellick and the girl? All taken care of.

592
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,960
I'm gonna keep T-Bag in protective custody

593
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:18,962
until we get Scylla-- then, I'm gonna make somebody

594
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,464
at Illinois DOC very, very happy.

595
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:21,590
But more importantly,

596
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:23,133
what the hell is that room downstairs?

597
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,761
That's not where they keep the device
that decodes Scylla, is it?

598
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:27,137
No.

599
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:29,139
That's just what T-Bag thought.

600
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:31,809
The road to Scylla only begins down there.

601
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,727
This is the room where we've got T-Bag now.

602
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:35,729
Just past the south wall,

603
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:36,980
there's an access tunnel that runs

604
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:38,690
for about 300 yards or so.

605
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:40,484
We get through that, we're in.

606
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:41,819
That's where we can decode Scylla.

607
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:43,153
And this is the building

608
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:44,363
where General Krantz's office is.

609
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,572
There you go. SELF: I was there today,

610
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:46,865
but I have to tell you, the security

611
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:47,950
in that place is unbelievable.

612
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:49,076
According to the blueprint,

613
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,286
the substructure is completely exposed.

614
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,579
It shouldn't take more than 24 hours

615
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,331
to get in there. It's only gonna take 24 hours?

616
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:58,127
All we have to do is get that last card first.

617
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:02,005
Well, based on what I've deciphered so far,

618
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:04,258
we're gonna need around-the-clock access to GATE,

619
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:05,551
starting immediately.

620
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:07,469
If you can get us some suits and IDs,

621
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,138
we could go in there as IRS agents

622
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:10,514
auditing the books-- I mean, considering

623
00:42:10,597 --> 00:42:12,099
the kind of racket they're running,

624
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:13,934
nobody would have a problem believing that.

625
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:15,477
Can you make that happen?

626
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:16,603
Yeah, I could do it.

627
00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:25,529
It's under the can.

628
00:42:30,242 --> 00:42:31,368
Hello?

629
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,953
GRETCHEN: We have a lot in common.

630
00:42:33,036 --> 00:42:34,329
Yeah, who is this?

631
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:36,540
Just another interested party in what you're up to.

632
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:38,834
Yeah, what's that?

633
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:41,628
“Scylla”,Open the envelope.

634
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:47,176
The pages I've got only got to 77.

635
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:48,969
Is this more blueprint?

636
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,721
I don't know.

637
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:53,348
What do you want?

638
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:54,683
I don't know what you've done

639
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:56,101
with Bagwell, but unless I see him,

640
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:57,728
you're not getting the rest of the pages.

641
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,729
Is that right?

642
00:42:58,771 --> 00:43:00,314
Give me that.

643
00:43:00,397 --> 00:43:01,899
Who is this?

644
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:04,568
Hello, Michael.

645
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:09,568
