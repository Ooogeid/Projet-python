00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,530
<i>Previously on Prison Break.</i>

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,570
I just want to go.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,990
It's okay.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,670
<i>What special talents 
do you have</i>

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,920
<i>that the Company might 
make the decision</i>

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,810
that you are worth more to 
them alive than dead?

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,020
Be careful,Alex.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,830
Were you able to find my book? 
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
But there was this guy.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,550
He took it.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,000
He said to tell you

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,570
that Scofield's brother has it now.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,090
<i>You have to break them 
out of there.</i>

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,950
LJ!

15
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,300
Sara!

16
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,740
<i>You're never going to tr 
anything like that again.</i>

17
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,090
But just to make sure,

18
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,920
<i>I left you a little 
something in the garage.</i>

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,030
What's so interesting out there, 
other than our freedom?

20
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,260
Vine's alive,so the fence is dead. No current.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,010
Yeah? Everyone in here knows 
that fence doesn't work,

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,120
and it doesn't mean 
a bloody thing,

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,850
because there are 
soldiers out there

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,430
that'll shoot you dead before 
you get within 30 yards of it.

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,200
Well,I guess I got a lot of
 work to do,don't I?

26
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,230
Listen,mate,I get what you're 
doing with my book.

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,030
They hold your girlfriend, 
you hold what they want.

28
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,830
Countering needs. Churchill 101.

29
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,650
Soon those bastards 
are going to ask me

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,380
what progress I've made in figuring 
out what they want,

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,090
and I'm going to say nil,'cause 
Lincoln Burrows has the book.

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,380
You know what?

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,900
Threatening the brother

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,900
of the guy who's supposed to 
get you out of here

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,400
might not be the smartest move.

36
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,880
I'm not threatening-- 
we're on the same team.

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,650
But if we play games with that book,

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,810
people who want me out of here 
will take action against us all.

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,780
"I never worry about action, 
only inaction."

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,470
Churchill 101.

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,310
Now,like I said, 
I got a lot of work to do.

42
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,460
alright?u

43
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm sorry,man.

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,310
Just all this stuff-- 
it's starting to get to me.

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,090
You know?

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,410
Listen,our situation could 
change very,very soon.

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,950
The grave digger for the prison.

48
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,880
I need you to reach out to him.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,200
And tell him what?

50
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,610
It's all written down.

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,920
But we got to get started now.

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,240
What are you not telling me?

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,120
All these people

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,460
that have been hurt because of me.

55
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,270
You know,it's...

56
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,860
I'm so sorry,Michael.

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,700
They did this, not you.

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,940
Okay?

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,580
It's not your fault.

60
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,840
Just get to the grave digger.

61
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,780
I feel like we're running out of time.

62
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,900
Sara.

63
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,610
I am just a soldier in this war,
Lincoln,

64
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,190
just like you.

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,330
I did not want to do that.

66
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,790
Can you even comprehend the intimacy

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,750
of the mechanics of what 
I had to do to that woman?

68
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,080
It's horrible!

69
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,860
Now,if you and your brother 
are done playing games,

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,310
LJ will be fine.

71
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,920
If not,the last thing I want to do

72
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,720
is start mailing pieces 
of him to you.

73
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,000
But if you push me,

74
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,010
and not even that far,I will.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,140
I'll do anything you want.

76
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,670
Just don't hurt my son.

77
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,640
That's really up to you.

78
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,400
I know the past few days 
have been hard,

79
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,620
for me,as well.

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,140
If you want to talk about it,

81
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,400
I know what this pain feels like.

82
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,080
I just want to get your 
boy out of Sona

83
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,690
and get my son back.

84
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,110
Michael's got a plan.

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,130
I need details.

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,670
We need to bring someone

87
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,210
who works at the prison onto the team.

88
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,630
Who? The grave digger.

89
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,500
Get it done.

90
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,820
Lincoln,I'm going to need that book.

91
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,600
The Company did handwriting 
analysis on the one you gave me,

92
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,290
and yours hasn't changed 
since high school.

93
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,110
Just soldiers,Linc.

94
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,720
Different armies, 
but soldiers just the same.

95
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,340
Nice.

96
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,400
I was the best in my school.

97
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,490
All-girls?

98
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,530
Kiss my ass,

99
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,290
bro.

100
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,350
20 bucks says you can't do that again.

101
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,960
Bet. Wait.

102
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,900
Adjust for wind.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,090
Shut up.

104
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,010
Just a bit outside.

105
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,020
<i>Hey,bro,you know I don't have 
that kind of verde lying around.</i>

106
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,790
It's going to take a while.

107
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,780
Well,the thing is, I don't have a while.

108
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,330
So,unless... No,no more favors.

109
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,360
All right.

110
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,970
Can I borrow that cross of yours?

111
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,620
I'll take it in trade. 
My dad gave me this.

112
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,840
Besides,it's not even real gold.

113
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,210
That's why I need it.

114
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,400
Look,I'll give it back,okay?

115
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
It's just a loan.

116
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,390
Come on.

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,040
This time,I want to know why.

118
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,640
It's light again.

119
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,910
Someone's getting fat off 
of everything I built

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
while I rot in here.

121
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,470
Don't get upset,???

122
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,420
I only have a few more hours.

123
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,670
Let's be nice.

124
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,120
This motherless bitch.

125
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,020
Alex?

126
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,660
You just get here?

127
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,490
Yes.

128
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,530
Listen,

129
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,940
I've been thinking about our little talk,

130
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,910
and,uh,you're in.

131
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,070
I'm in.

132
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,860
Okay.

133
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,830
Just like that? Right.

134
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,810
I really don't have a choice, do I?

135
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,010
What's the plan?

136
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm working on it.

137
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,420
Meanwhile, I could use your help.

138
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,470
What do you need?

139
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,890
A black felt-tipped pen.

140
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,530
A pen? Yeah.

141
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,260
Why? Some documents

142
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,480
that need altering.

143
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,320
I'll explain it to you later, 
but right now,I need that pen.

144
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,180
Okay? Yeah.

145
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,670
And I'll tell you what else I need.

146
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,370
I need you to get your act together.

147
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,680
I need you to bring yourself

148
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,710
under control,because you're 
attracting attention,

149
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,680
and that we don't need.

150
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm under control.

151
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,190
Of course you are.

152
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,620
<i>This is what happens when 
a system is overloaded.</i>

153
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,070
See? Look.

154
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,660
Son of a... Power is out.

155
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,270
Fix it.

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm a truck driver.

157
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,120
Hey,Alex.

158
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,460
Hey,glad I found ya. 
Just wanted to see how

159
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,670
you're holding up in here. 
Just dandy.

160
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,040
Yeah,well,I've been having 
a tough time of it myself.

161
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,390
And I was figuring,
it shouldn't be that way

162
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,960
for us,seeing as how 
we're the only lawmen here

163
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,980
in Taco Hell.

164
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,200
Hey,whoa, hang on a second there,Alex.

165
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,710
You and me-- we were a team

166
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,860
on the outside, remember?

167
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,310
I was your dog,and I still got 
a lot of bark left in me.

168
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,370
I'm busy,Brad. What do you want?

169
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,890
You and Scofield-- you're up 
to something,right?

170
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,600
You can tell me,one badge to another.

171
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,550
I can help.

172
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,880
Do you have a black felt-tipped pen?

173
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,460
Not on me.

174
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,580
Then you can't help me.

175
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,170
I know.

176
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,130
You know what?

177
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,990
I know you're trying to escape from here

178
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,310
with that man,Scofield.

179
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,700
Sweetheart... Please,don't lie to me.

180
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,950
Lincoln Burrows,
he told me everything.

181
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,690
There are some very powerful 
people that want me out of here.

182
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,500
And they want those brothers 
to get me out. Why?

183
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,450
I'm not sure.

184
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,100
Has something to do with 
a charter I did in Seattle.

185
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,770
What I do know is their end game

186
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,180
is exactly the same as ours,
and that's me out of this hellhole.

187
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,850
And once that happens,

188
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,240
you and I will disappear... forever.

189
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,490
But I don't want to involve 
you in this mess.

190
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,580
I want to help.

191
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,630
That's way too dangerous.

192
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,910
I'm not asking your permission,James.

193
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm telling you.

194
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,280
I can do this on my own,

195
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,140
or you can tell me what you know

196
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,620
and we can work it through together.

197
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,320
I don't understand everything that's going on,

198
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,990
but these brothers, they're obviously trying

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,270
to find out what they can about me.

200
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,970
Let's see what we 
can discover about them.

201
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,460
Find out what their plan is, 
see what they're all about.

202
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,750
They're trying to get you out, 
and you don't trust them?

203
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,220
I don't trust any of these guys.

204
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,700
And you shouldn't,either.

205
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,450
If you insist on getting into this,

206
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,680
promise me you'll be careful.

207
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,550
Because God knows I will die

208
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,730
if anything happens to you.

209
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,990
Hey.

210
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,130
Michael.

211
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,370
Here.

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,540
I said I need a black felt-tipped pen.

213
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,860
That's black.

214
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,010
It's not what I need.

215
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,720
Keep looking.

216
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,060
<i>He's playing you.</i>

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,080
<i>He's playing you.</i>

218
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,890
<i>Do not trust him.</i>

219
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,950
Your amigo,the American.

220
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,220
He's a builder, an engineer,no?

221
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,210
He's no amigo of mine,boss.

222
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,270
And trust me, you do not want

223
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,460
to get under the covers with that...

224
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,570
Is he or is he not an engineer?

225
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,080
Well,yeah,but...

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,400
Scofield.

227
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,160
Yeah?

228
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,130
What do you know about the electricity?

229
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,700
Only that we don't have any right now.

230
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,060
Let me tell you something.

231
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,250
This phone keeps all the
 food coming to the gate.

232
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,480
It keeps my business running, 
it keeps Sona running.

233
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,050
Electricity die, phone die.

234
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,340
Phone die,we die. We die or youdie?

235
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,790
Boy,you have enough

236
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,100
education,but you're not being smart.

237
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,270
Now,I come to you, 
that is an opportunity.

238
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,070
Be wise and take advantage.

239
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,130
Now,can you fix the electricity

240
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,290
just like you fixed the water?

241
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,440
It's not that simple.

242
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,360
The water pipes are inside the prison.

243
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,820
The electrical lines are 
probably running underground

244
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,460
along an exterior wall,

245
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,420
which means 
they're out there somewhere

246
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,580
in no-man's-land.

247
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,880
So,you can fix the power?

248
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,970
Last I checked,they shoot 
prisoners who go out there.

249
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,220
So I'm thinking the answer is "no."

250
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,070
You listen to me,

251
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,260
and you listen closely, water boy.

252
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,690
Like it or not,soldiers or not,

253
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,820
??????

254
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,430
<i>It's a suicide mission.</i>

255
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,740
<i>I'll make some calls.</i>

256
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,860
And you're going to keep me safe? 
As best I can.

257
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,400
I don't think I can do this.

258
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,280
<i>No,no,no,no,no. 
You will help me with this.</i>

259
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,020
Look,I will do something for you.

260
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,430
I'll get you a new pillow,

261
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,520
goose-feather like mine, 
or a small TV.

262
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,140
All right.

263
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,810
Get me that.

264
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,930
Why? It's the first one to get 
sunlight in the morning.

265
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,680
You get me that cell, 
I'll get you electricity.

266
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,480
Hey,Linc.

267
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,030
Look,bro,um,I'm going to be out 
of your way real soon.

268
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,430
I saw these flyers for 
migrant workers in Colombia.

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,600
It's coffee bean season,

270
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,820
and they're letting Panamanians in,

271
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,950
so I figure, with a good ID,I can pass.

272
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,180
Bus leaves today,okay?

273
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,240
All right,well,
before you get out of here,man,I...

274
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,120
I'm meeting someone, 
and I need a translator.

275
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,320
Linc,uh... I appreciate 
everything you've done...

276
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,670
It'll just be a couple hours.

277
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,310
Just a couple hours, that's it.

278
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,480
When I was 15,my cousin told me 
about a job that only lasts

279
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,120
a few hours and,uh, 
I got three months in juvie.

280
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,240
I can't do this without you.

281
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,170
I'm in Panama, 
I don't speak the language...

282
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,550
And I can't miss that bus.

283
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm going to make money 
and send it home.

284
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,380
Underground or not, 
I'm going to be a dad,Linc,

285
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,240
and you out of all people 
should understand that.

286
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,320
I spoke to James.

287
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,370
He confirmed what you told me

288
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,490
about the escape.

289
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,770
You and I, we both have people in there

290
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,790
we care about.

291
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,770
Please... let me help you.

292
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,220
Your Spanish as good as your English?

293
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,130
<i>Yes,Colonel.</i>

294
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,780
I just have one favor to ask.

295
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,710
It's just outside of the gate.

296
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,800
You,you can bring your men.

297
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,880
The phone is dying.

298
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,870
Make him one.

299
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,770
This is it?

300
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,030
Not everyone has it yet.

301
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,640
We let credit go a week, 
and there is still time.

302
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,100
<i>The money's in your veins,addicto.</i>

303
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,940
<i>No,patrón. I don't use anymore. 
I swear to you.</i>

304
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,810
I sweaCHERto y No.

305
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,260
I swear to you. I swear to you.

306
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,540
Chin up, pal o' mine,Chin up.

307
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,970
<i>S? Colonel.</i>

308
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,220
Yes,thank you,Colonel.

309
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,210
We'll be right there.

310
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,980
Come with me.

311
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,330
Excuse me. Do you,um...

312
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,070
Do you have a-a,a pen?

313
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,520
Pen. Pen. Not,um...

314
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,190
Not... not the brush

315
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,740
but the pen. Pen. Pen.

316
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,780
<i>No,pintura.</i>

317
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,810
<i>Yeah,yeah,pintura. Yeah.</i>

318
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,950
<i>He's leaving you.</i>

319
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,280
<i>He's leaving you, he'll be gone,</i>

320
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,020
<i>and you'll be stuck 
in this maze... forever.</i>

321
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,500
Thank you for arranging this for us,Colonel.

322
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,490
I'm getting something out of this as well,

323
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,410
I assure you.

324
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,680
You know you can fix 
this electric problem?

325
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,150
I won't know for sure until 
we can start digging,

326
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,340
but yes,I think so.

327
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,300
My men will

328
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,720
shoot you in the back of the head

329
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,360
if you so much as look at the fence,eh?

330
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,370
And you,patrón,if anything goes wrong.

331
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,630
it will not only be his life that is lost.

332
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,070
You have my word on that.

333
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,610
No worries,Colonel.

334
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,100
I'll keep this boy in line.

335
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,710
I'll dig.

336
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,050
I don't need your help.

337
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,610
Hey,come on,now, don't be proud.

338
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,350
I heard you talking just yesterday.

339
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,760
Talking to Mahone.

340
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,640
You know,about how us Americans 
should stick together.

341
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,320
So I help you now, and I'm sure you'll

342
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,120
help me down the road,right,Mikey?

343
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,820
What is it, a '66 or a '67?

344
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,690
<i>¿Perdon? Your car.</i>

345
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,370
<i>El quiere saber el ano.</i>

346
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,140
<i>¿Este aqui?</i>

347
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,560
<i>Pues,es un '66.</i>

348
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,630
<i>Y es mi preciosa.</i>

349
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,880
'66.

350
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,970
Uh-huh. What is it,325 horses?

351
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,810
<i>¿Caballos de fuerza?</i>

352
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,810
375.

353
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,810
375.

354
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,270
<i>Perdon a me,señorita. Mm-hmm.</i>

355
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,260
What's he saying? He recognizes me,but

356
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,970
he doesn't realize it was at the prison.

357
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,770
Ask him does he want to make enough cash

358
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,290
to get this car cherry by next week?

359
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,040
He knows we're not talking about cars.

360
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,040
That's right.

361
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,690
Come on,Scofield,I know you're 
getting out of here.

362
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,040
I heard it all about you and the limey.

363
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,710
I'm just fixing the electricity,Boss.

364
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,740
Yeah,right,and I'm just single 
'cause I'm choosy.

365
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,930
Don't make me tell anyone what I know.

366
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,500
What is it you think you know?

367
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,240
Somebody called "the Company" 
wanted you in here

368
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,480
to work with that Whistler guy.

369
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,480
Am I warm? What's the Company?

370
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,860
What do they want with Whistler?

371
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't know,but you do.

372
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,370
Doesn't sound like you know much after all.

373
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,220
I don't need to know

374
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,340
how to change a diaper

375
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,080
to know when it stinks to high hell.

376
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,110
You're doing something here,Scofield.

377
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,680
You're right. I am.

378
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,040
I'm fixing the electricity.

379
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,010
Now,you wanted to help dig?

380
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,150
Dig.

381
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,930
Hey,this is it.

382
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,510
I assume we're doing more than 
just than playing electrician.

383
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,310
Don't worry.

384
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,730
We're exactly where we need to be.

385
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,140
Heat's getting to me,Scofield.

386
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,650
It's quitting time.

387
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,470
You mind telling me why he's 
even out here with us?

388
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,230
He knows something's up.

389
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,400
How the hell does he know that?

390
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,970
Let's just say I have a bit of a rep.

391
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,540
From Fox River?

392
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,060
I know who you are,mate.

393
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,050
Figured it out just lately.

394
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,470
Finally made sense why they pick you

395
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,530
of all people to send here.

396
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,590
No worries.

397
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,790
It's in my interest to keep 
your little secret.

398
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,430
But Bellick?

399
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,670
Can't be trusted.

400
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,550
I can handle Bellick.

401
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,160
He's not in on this.

402
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,510
Okay,good.

403
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,990
But Mahone is.

404
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,650
Mahone?

405
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,660
He's looking about as stable 
as a three-legged chair,

406
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,640
and he's escaping with us?

407
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,020
No,he just thinks he is.

408
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,020
He needs his meds.

409
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,770
Without them, he'll self destruct.

410
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,080
It's just a matter of time.

411
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,420
And if he doesn't?

412
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,130
I'll string him along, 
tell him what he wants to hear,

413
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,580
and then I'll cut him loose.

414
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,560
How do I know you're not going 
to do the same thing to me?

415
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,300
You don't.

416
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,380
You need a hook-up, my friend?

417
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,240
No.

418
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,160
Take your time.

419
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,350
I don't hard sell.

420
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,160
My product speaks for itself.

421
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,690
Outside,I took something.

422
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,130
It's a prescription drug 
called Varatril,

423
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,260
and I was wondering if you...

424
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,920
<i>This ain't no farmacia.</i>

425
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,210
But what I got right here...

426
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,420
it's better than anything your doctor

427
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,800
gave you back in the States.

428
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,730
That's tar.

429
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,280
<i>Just take a taste, algo pequenito.</i>

430
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,980
You know,keep it in check.

431
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,140
I don't have any money right now.

432
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,170
Then I don't have any drugs.

433
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,080
But there are a few ways for a man

434
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,500
to make a few dollars in Sona...

435
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,160
servicing the needs of others--

436
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,120
not something I'm into...

437
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,270
You think I'm a punk?

438
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,200
I'm just helping you

439
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,490
get well,friend,just helping you get well.

440
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,050
Señor Lechero?

441
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,190
Señor Lechero.

442
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,640
What do you want?

443
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,440
Look,I know you're a busy man, 
but I wanted to tell ya,

444
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,820
I don't know exactly what he's doing,

445
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,540
<i>but Michael Scofield's taking 
you for a ride. No,cerdo,</i>

446
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,820
I don't think so.

447
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,210
Listen,I heard him talking 
about escape yesterday--

448
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,880
about breaking outta here. 
It's he's talking about escape,

449
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,810
why are you here telling me 
and you're not going with him,eh?

450
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,470
I would if he'd let me, 
but he's already cut me out.

451
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,950
He says he's square,but I know

452
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,430
the son of a bitch is up to something.

453
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,350
So I figured,

454
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,050
if I ain't running, I might as well tell you

455
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,640
and make my time in here a little bit easier.

456
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,410
Every man fantasizes 
about escaping from Sona.

457
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,410
Yeah,but they aren't all in 
no-man's-land with shovels.

458
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,500
I'm gave him the shovels. Get him out.

459
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,830
I gave him shovels too, and guys 
to work with, just like you.

460
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,030
I worked in the prison he broke out of.

461
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,090
He said he was doing me a favor--

462
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,610
fixing damage from a fire he started.

463
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,920
And you know what I got?

464
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,370
Hog-tied and left in a pipe 
under my own prison.

465
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,490
There's nothing he can do.

466
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,240
The soldiers are watching him.

467
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,070
That's what I thought,

468
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,550
until he tunneled out of my guard's room.

469
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,980
He's buried something in 
a junction box out there

470
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,310
and covered it with dirt-- I saw him.

471
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,750
Go see for yourself.

472
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,550
If I'm lyin',I'm dyin'.

473
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,990
Trouble keeps finding you here 
in Sona,doesn't it?

474
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,340
Let's take a walk,eh?

475
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,320
There are rumors about that 
you are trying to trick me.

476
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,730
I'm just doing what I'm told.

477
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,640
Oh? Let's hope for your sake that's true.

478
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,950
Hmm?!

479
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,930
But just to make sure,

480
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,380
let's go on out to no-man's-land

481
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,470
???????

482
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,110
Just want to make sure

483
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,580
my men are doing a good job for the colonel.

484
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:15,770
Get in there.

485
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,810
Get in there.

486
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,280
Open it.

487
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,740
Move the dirt.

488
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,090
Now!

489
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,290
It's duct tape.

490
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,700
To fix the frayed wires.

491
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,760
That's why the power was so inconsistent.

492
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,650
I didn't want the tape to come loose,

493
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,040
so I packed it down with dirt.

494
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,200
Beautiful.

495
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,690
Where are you going?

496
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,670
I got to turn the main power switch back on.

497
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,320
I had to turn it off,so we could work on th

498
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,120
ll wiI' come th you.

499
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,100
It's just a switch.

500
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,580
I can handle it myself.

501
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,090
You can... but you won't.

502
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,010
Hey,water boy, it's back here.

503
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,190
I don't need the chain, just the cross.

504
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,220
It's the perfect size and it's not real gold,

505
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,690
so it won't conduct current.

506
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,750
Keep the circuit open--

507
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,590
no power even when the main switch

508
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,540
is turned on.

509
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,730
Tahe cross out...

510
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,870
Sona lights up again.

511
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,380
Lechero find out you messed with his electric...

512
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,090
you're dead.

513
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,760
That's why he can't ever find out.

514
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,560
Now,don't make me come get you.

515
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,440
Nobody back there can help you.

516
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,840
Uh,it's...

517
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,710
It's some kind of mistake.

518
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,740
It should be working.

519
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,100
The only mistake I made was trusting you.

520
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,080
Sammy.

521
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,940
Transformer delay.

522
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,300
It's an old prison.

523
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,080
Now,if you don't mind...

524
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,340
I'd like to move into my new cell.

525
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,880
<i>Thank you for your words 
before,blanco.</i>

526
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,490
Working for Lechero,

527
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,950
<i>not an easy field to plow,comprende?</i>

528
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,850
Oh,yeah,yeah,I comprend.

529
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,110
You and me,we're

530
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,590
amigos,Nieves.

531
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,130
When Lechero is in a better mood,

532
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,030
I'm going to put in a good word,help you,

533
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,450
how you say, "move up the ladder."

534
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,170
I appreciate

535
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,550
<i>it,compadre,but I</i>

536
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,350
was always taught

537
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,170
that God helps those 
that help themselves.

538
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,760
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

539
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,480
$15,000...

540
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,280
Why? Because that's what he wanted.

541
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,350
Relax. I'll get you the money.

542
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,510
And I will meet you there. Okay.

543
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,220
How are you holding up?

544
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,650
I just want to get this done.

545
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,450
Good.

546
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,440
Stay here.

547
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,240
I'm coming with you. Stay here.

548
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,280
You expect me to stay here and wait? 
I don't care what you do.

549
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,130
You don't care? Who the hell 
are you to say you don't care?

550
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,460
You're not the only one affected by this.

551
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah,I know; that's the problem.

552
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,030
But you will still just run off 
and do whatever you want?

553
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,540
What kind of a man are you that just...

554
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,760
They killed Sara and put her head in a box!

555
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,110
And they've got my son!

556
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,480
Oh,Linc,I'm.... I'm sorry.

557
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,500
You still here?

558
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,980
You're just in the way.

559
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,210
Hey,Lechero wants to talk to you.

560
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,910
I was just about to get a little trim.

561
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,980
Lechero said I was looking all bhuttu!

562
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,870
It'll wait.

563
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,980
Did you know about this?

564
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,860
No.

565
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
Did you know anything about this?!

566
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,700
Me? No! No! Nieves...

567
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,680
Nieves-- we was friends,man.

568
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,600
That's right!

569
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,860
If you knew he was using and didn't tell me...

570
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,210
his death is on your head.

571
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,810
<i>Patrón,patrón,patrón...</i>

572
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,650
I don't know nothing about drugs.

573
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,130
I don't. I don't.

574
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,840
I mean,hell,I...

575
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,040
I tried me some reefer when I was 12,

576
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,550
I almost coughed up a lung.

577
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,980
Good.

578
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,170
That's good.

579
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,370
Teodoro.

580
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,580
There appears to be an opening on my crew.

581
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,000
McGrady,here's your cross back.

582
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,010
And,uh... thank you.

583
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,850
You're a real smart guy.

584
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,560
What the hell are you doing in prison?

585
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,310
Here.

586
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,410
It's perfect.

587
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,530
How did you get it?

588
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,370
It's what you wanted,right?

589
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,180
Yeah.

590
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,980
Good work.

591
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,100
So what's the next step?

592
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,200
Uh... we wait.

593
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,730
I'll keep you posted.

594
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,490
<i>You know what you need to do.</i>

595
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,730
What do you think?

596
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,250
but it can't have been 
to make that fence sizzle

597
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,430
like the third bloody rail.

598
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
Unless you want to make the colonel happy.

599
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,420
Actually,it's in both of our best interests

600
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,190
to make that fence as deadly as possible.

601
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,290
Now all we have

602
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,600
to do is wait for my brother to come through

603
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,620
with the grave digger.

604
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
He wants more.

605
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,620
You said $15,000.

606
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,530
You said $15,000!

607
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,350
You said $15,000! You said $15,000!

608
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,950
We got it,Linc! I got it!

609
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,630
No,no,no!

610
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,450
What the hell are you doing?!

611
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,320
We need him! He will sell us

612
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,890
out to the cops after he takes

613
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,270
as much as he can from us.

614
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,720
No!

615
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,310
<i>He's packing up to go.</i>

616
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,590
<i>Kill him.</i>

617
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,690
<i>He's going to betray you. Kill him.</i>

618
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,680
Good news,Agent Mahone!

619
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,890
Due to the untimely

620
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,560
demise of Señor Juan Nieves,

621
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,680
I have now been promoted manager 
in charge of retail distribution

622
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,320
and customer liaison.

623
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,410
Get away from me.

624
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,540
All in due time.

625
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,830
Now,I'm not your momma,

626
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,150
and I ain't one to wipe other's noses,

627
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,510
but let's just say you've looked better.

628
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,770
I want nothing from you.

629
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,130
<i>But sure seems you need something.</i>

630
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,810
On the arm.

631
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,260
No strings attached.

632
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,220
<i>Get your head straight,Alex.</i>

633
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,310
Come on in,man.

634
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,820
Come watch the match. Come.

635
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,010
Oh,yeah. You guys call this 
football down here,right?

636
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,520
Very good,very good.

637
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,630
It's World Cup-- football without the silly hats

638
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,740
you wear in America,

639
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,300
where they all jump on top each other

640
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,830
like a bunch of batty boys.

641
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:14,900
Have a seat.

642
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,670
Come.

643
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,920
Teodoro.

644
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,310
<i>Caf?</i>

645
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,920
The only thing I hate more than a rat

646
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,640
is a rat with bad information.

647
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,340
Yeah,look,I'm sorry about all that,

648
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,720
but my information was good.

649
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,370
It's just that Scofield is a tricky bastard.

650
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,400
He'll try something again. You'll see.

651
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,710
Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

652
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,520
Come on,you guys. What are you doing to me?

653
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,450
Come on! I gave you good information!

654
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,330
Scofield's planning to escape! I'm telling you!

655
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,100
He's a smart bastard!

656
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,720
Come on,you guys. Come on. What are you doing?

657
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,330
No. No.

658
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,390
Shh. Shh. Shh...

659
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,740
No! No.

660
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,600
Look,I gave you good information.

661
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,150
Oh!

662
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,370
You said something this morning about,

663
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,080
"If I'm lyin',I'm dyin'."

664
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,310
Just be thankful I don't hold you to that.

665
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,150
Come on,

666
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,040
agwe.

667
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,350
Help me here,man! Come on.

668
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,370
Bagwell!

669
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,700
You left this in your old cell.

670
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,600
Thanks,Alex.

671
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,630
You're welcome.

672
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,040
It's funny that you could forget something

673
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,780
as important as this is.

674
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,280
Well,I'm glad you found it for me.

675
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,090
Yeah.

676
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,530
Oh. Oh,look.

677
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,350
You are breathing only by my grace,Michael.

678
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,450
Now,you remember the next time that

679
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,270
you're going to send me on a goose chase.

680
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,390
Okay? I didn't.

681
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,920
No,no. You did.

682
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,360
And you think you can manipulate me,

683
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,350
just like you did to Sucre... and Tweener

684
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,420
and Haywire.

685
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,100
I'm not your errand boy.

686
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,520
I'm going to go with you when you escape,

687
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,210
and if you think, in any way...

688
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,690
that you'll leave me,

689
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,610
I will put this piece of metal right in that

690
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,740
very small space

691
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,100
right between your eyes. I will.

692
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,320
How's LJ? How's Sara?

693
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,710
They told me they're fine.

694
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,740
Listen,uh, the grave digger

695
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,600
is gone.

696
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,820
What do you mean, he's gone?

697
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,130
Linc,we can't do this without him.

698
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,430
We know,we know,that's why we 
went to his supervisor--

699
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,860
the guy who approves any hires for that job.

700
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,870
Turns out he could use some cash.

701
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,110
<i>Oye,man. Mail call.</i>

702
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,810
This is how we're getting out?

703
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,150
Yes.

704
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,190
With a little help from an old friend.

705
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,860
What is that?

706
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,600
Kesslivol.

707
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,240
It's a chemical that kills the odors

708
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,850
caused by decomposing bodies.

709
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,790
And when heated to a certain degree...

710
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,970
...it eats through steel.

725
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:09,043
