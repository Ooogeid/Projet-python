<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:08,652
Let me get this straight.
The brothers come back to a city

3
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,035
that's 15 miles from the prison
they escaped from. Why ?

4
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:12,451
Because the president
is in Chicago

5
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,338
to make a speech,
and they're up to something,

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,495
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

7
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:17,607
So we blackmail her.

8
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:18,858
In exchange for what?

9
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:21,074
A presidential pardon.

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,012
Are we gonna keep crying about money

11
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:24,617
you've already got coming to you?

12
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:25,921
Or do you want to make some more?

13
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:27,866
- I'm listening.
- Ever been to Mexico?

14
00:00:27,974 --> 00:00:30,362
When's the meal coming around?
I'm starved.

15
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:33,379
Freshen me up
when you get a chance, darlin'.

16
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:37,396
<i>Tia, ella es Maricruz.</i>

17
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,920
I'll check this bag for you, sir.

18
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,538
That's coming with me. Give it back.

19
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:44,394
Sir, I know that bag
is way over the weight limit.

20
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:46,438
Your bag will be safe.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,982
They're watching you. But from where?

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,592
There.

23
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:53,447
President Reynolds ruined your life;
she ruined my life.

24
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:54,752
You want to take that bitch down?

25
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:57,951
You just found your inside man,
but it's got to be right now.

26
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:59,903
Have either of these men checked in?

27
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,959
Yeah. Room 1006.

28
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,902
Today,
you'll get a package in your cell.

29
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:06,599
It's gonna be from me.
I need you to use it. Okay?

30
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:27,374
Open on four!

31
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,229
I need a hand in here!

32
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,789
- I need a medic in B-4!
- Let me die.

33
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:50,795
Let me die.

I think you'd better go.

You sure?

44
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,142
Thank you for your help,
but, there's nothing more

45
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,571
- you can do for us.
- It doesn't feel right, just leaving.

46
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:42,405
I don't think you want any part of this.
Thank you.

47
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,942
- It's ten minutes away, right?
- At least.

48
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,086
Listen, if this doesn't work,

49
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,757
we're gonna need a way out. For good.

50
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,513
Well, that's on you.

51
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,022
What about Derek?

52
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:04,979
Derek Sweeney?

53
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:08,677
- You think he'll be up for this?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:09,777
All right.

00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,648
You want to meet at the park?

57
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:16,193
How's Third and Racine?

58
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,690
Third and Racine?

3:15, the corner.

60
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,201
I'll be there.

61
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:24,874
If anything happens...

62
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:28,109
I love you both.

When were they here,
5 minutes, 10 minutes?

67
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,107
- They were never here.
- I know they were here.

68
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:29,274
Where did they go?

69
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,620
- I don't know.
- No, you do know.

70
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:37,059
He decided it was for the best,
and I couldn't take this anymore.

71
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:38,973
It's over just like that?

72
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:40,965
- Yeah.
- It's over like the time

73
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:43,192
you flew to New Mexico
on dead woman's ID to meet him?

74
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,948
Or it's over
like the time that you met up

75
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,247
and got back together
at the train station in Evansville?

76
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,868
Or maybe like the day, today,

77
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:51,029
when you checked into this hotel here
2 h ago?

78
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:53,814
- Which one is it like ?
- I don't care you believe me.

79
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,632
- I'm telling you the truth.
- He's not going to call you?

80
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:57,859
Don't lie to me.

81
00:06:58,061 --> 00:06:59,505
You don't want to do that.

82
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,795
Can you tell me what the sign
means over there?

83
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:36,098
I'm just wondering.

<i>No hablo granjero.</i>

85
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:47,695
I need the phone.

86
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,567
Listen to me, man, it needs to be today.

87
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:52,230
My family is in trouble, all right?

88
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,732
There's man out there
who's trying to hurt my family.

89
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,244
Your family is fine.
There's nobody after your family.

90
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,444
No, look at me, man.

91
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,435
Look, I'm not crazy, okay?

92
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:03,511
I know the rules.

93
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:08,681
I wouldn't be asking you
if it wasn't an emergency.

94
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:12,087
Please, just let me use that phone.

95
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:27,106
- Agent Lang.
- <i>I need to speak to Mahone, please.</i>

96
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,401
Can I have him return?

97
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,624
Listen, this is Benjamin Miles Franklin,

98
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,497
and I need to speak
to Mahone right away.

99
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:39,112
- It's Franklin for Mahone.
- I'll take it.

100
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,268
Mr. Franklin? This is agent Wheeler.

101
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:48,108
<i>- I don't believe we've met before.</i>
- I need to speak to Mahone.

102
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:50,842
Something I can help you with?

103
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:53,786
Listen...

104
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,669
I want to leave a message for him.

105
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,089
<i>You tell him...</i>

106
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:02,793
You tell him that I'll do
what he wants me to do, okay?

107
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,697
I just need a little bit more time.
I'll do it.

108
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:07,514
Just don't hurt them.

109
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,536
<i>You hear me?</i>

110
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,412
Don't hurt them.

111
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:16,962
What's up?

112
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Excuse me.

113
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:56,121
- What the hell are you doing here, man?
- Keep your voice down. Keep it down.

114
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:03,134
How you been?

115
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,385
- You all right?
- It's good to see you, man.

116
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:07,445
You, too, brother.

117
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,261
If some of the guys knew you were here,
they might not be too cool.

118
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:12,982
Well, I ain't hanging around;
I need a favor.

119
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:14,529
- You owe me.
-I do.

120
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:15,626
You know I do.

121
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:17,573
Look, it's just...

122
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,962
Look, it's just your situation
right now.

123
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,718
I mean, I just had a kid, a baby boy,

124
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,193
and I promised Marie...

125
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:25,699
I didn't come here to cause trouble.

126
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:28,293
I'm short on friends.
I need you to hook me up.

127
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,395
I know you can do it
without the green up front.

128
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,289
I'm serious about this, man.

129
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:34,652
Here. I need it.

130
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,108
I'll give it a shot.

131
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:48,287
- By when?
- ASAP.

132
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,470
- Tomorrow? The next day?
- Now.

133
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,267
Now.

134
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:01,963
All right, Linc.

135
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:03,555
Come with me.

136
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:04,146
Who saw him go down?

137
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,109
- Any press?
- We got him down pretty quick,

138
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,165
but you never know.

139
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:08,517
Some may have gotten a shot.

140
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:09,518
Check around.

141
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,014
Confiscate cameras if you need to.

142
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:14,652
Put out a statement
before rumors get started.

143
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:17,606
And get everyone out of here.

144
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,634
Now.

145
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,482
We're waiting for the response
from Counter...

146
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:28,161
You and I both know that this situation
requires us to abandon protocol.

147
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:32,826
I don't know what you need to tell them,
but I need your men to leave.

148
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:35,832
Now.

149
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,490
Yes, sir.

150
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,374
Where's your brother?

151
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,626
- I need to see the president.
- Really?

152
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,154
And you think that's a possibility?

153
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,244
She'll want to hear what I have to say.

154
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:55,578
Oh, I highly doubt that.

155
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,828
The only person you get to talk to...

156
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,610
...is me.

157
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:11,457
And the only way you're going
to live through the next hour

158
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:14,229
is if you tell me
where to find your brother.

159
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,931
Okay.

160
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:20,746
He's in a safe place.

161
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:21,789
Be more specific.

162
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,559
Specifically...

163
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,003
a place you will never find him.

164
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:41,899
I had the honor...

165
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:46,424
to attend Mountfort military academy.

166
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,578
whose mission it is

167
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,212
to ensure the greatness of this country
and his future leadership,

168
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:58,734
encouraging patriotism,

169
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:00,906
building a strong moral foundations

170
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:02,749
and providing the service of men

171
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,275
committed to the values of honor,

172
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,925
freedom and country.

173
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,657
But...

174
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,739
first and foremost,

175
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:14,407
they taught you this.

176
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:34,571
How do you say "cherries" again?

177
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,829
<i>Cereza.</i>

178
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,885
Looks like you have to get more <i>cerezas.</i>

179
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,630
I've just got you 100 <i>pistachios,</i>

180
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:44,043
with the right amount of salt, too.

181
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,292
Well, it's the combination.

182
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,298
I need both.

183
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,059
Why I am I a sucker for you, huh?

184
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,170
What? What's she saying?

185
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,244
That looks like T-Bag.

186
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,832
He said he was trying to steal luggage
from the airport,

187
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,936
He's got $5 million. Why would he...?

188
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,637
Unless he doesn't have it.

189
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:37,739
Unless he lost it there.

190
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,492
- Stop it, Fernando. - What?

191
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:42,724
Do you really believe
that that money is at the airport?

192
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:45,362
Forget it.

193
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:47,649
Look at what we have together.

194
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:50,405
Do you really want to risk that?

195
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,955
We have everything that we need.

196
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:55,715
- Except your <i>cerezas.</i>
- Right.

197
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,422
I'll be right back.

198
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,759
I'll be right back.

199
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,788
You got to know it's not real hard
for me to recognize a junkie.

200
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,008
I'm...

201
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,018
I'm saying

202
00:18:58,327 --> 00:18:59,499
you don't look so good.

203
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:03,867
I'm fine.

204
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:04,993
Yeah.

205
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,653
You mind me asking what you're taking?

206
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:12,037
Here. You want one?

207
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:13,401
- No, that's okay.
- Here.

208
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:16,849
Save it for later.

209
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:22,604
Varatril.

210
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,931
Benzodiazepine's a hard-core
tranquilizer, man.

211
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:29,856
You take these every day?

212
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:32,775
20 milligrams.

213
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,561
You must feel like you're walking
underwater.

214
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:40,822
I do.

215
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:43,273
It's very quiet, down here.

216
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,878
That's why you started, right?
Peace and quiet.

217
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,436
That's not why you do it anymore,
though, is it?

218
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:54,713
Now it's the headaches, right?

219
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:56,487
And you probably don't sleep.

220
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,110
And you know you're gonna
destroy yourself, right?

221
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,308
I haven't ruled that out
as a possibility.

222
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,608
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.

223
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,027
There's one difference between me
and Agent Mahone.

224
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,696
He doesn't know the value
of a bird in the hand,

225
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,792
he just keeps beating and beating
around that bush.

226
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:26,356
But if you don't give up Burrows,
I don't care.

227
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,015
One down, one to go.

228
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:34,545
I need to talk to Mr. Scofield.

229
00:20:35,204 --> 00:20:36,205
Alone.

230
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,115
Madam President...

231
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:08,616
could I...

232
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:11,577
have a word?

233
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,154
It wouldn't be prudent

234
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:17,684
- for me to leave you alone...
- My men...

235
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:20,589
are right outside this door.
I have a right to privacy.

236
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,087
Your rights

237
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,408
aren't my first concern.

238
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,020
Do I need to remind you
who you are talking to?

239
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:29,124
Step outside,

240
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,432
and close the door behind you.

241
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:59,105
The things you do for your brother.

242
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:01,310
It's impressive.

243
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,077
I could say the same for you.

244
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:08,176
But I won't.

245
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:11,013
Bear in mind,
your opinion means little to me.

246
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,500
This tape.

247
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:16,048
You have it with you?

248
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:21,990
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

249
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:29,206
You don't make arrangements
for me, Mr. Scofield.

250
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:31,109
I have people for that.

251
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,497
I'm not exactly sure
what is on this tape,

252
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,318
but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

253
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:42,582
It's a recorded conversation
between you and your brother.

254
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:44,609
Well, out of millions of conversations

255
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,186
that I had with my brother
during his lifetime...

256
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:48,517
I'll narrow it down for you.

257
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:52,255
It was recorded sometime...

258
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:53,961
after his death.

259
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:56,962
And this...

260
00:22:58,014 --> 00:22:59,936
particular conversation...

261
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:05,038
you might want to keep in the family.

262
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:09,821
And where is it?

263
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:13,713
20 different copies
in 20 different locations.

264
00:23:14,508 --> 00:23:16,357
I can call my brother right now.

265
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:18,451
He can play it for you.

266
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:19,862
Not on the phone.

267
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:21,943
Have him bring it here.

268
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:24,632
These are the terms.

269
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:28,245
You can hear it over the phone,

270
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,431
or you can hear it on the news.

271
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:34,625
It's up to you.

272
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:41,084
You know, it's why I started.

273
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:43,318
Started what?

274
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:45,377
Using.

275
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:46,586
Same reason as you.

276
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:49,195
Why, because you had to stay up
all night during residency?

277
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:54,478
Because the bass player dumped you
in front of the whole sorority?

278
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,602
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.

279
00:23:57,817 --> 00:23:59,339
I've seen people die, too.

280
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,689
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

281
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:05,281
You need help.

282
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:07,745
Not what I'm looking for.

283
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,773
For your sake, I hope your boyfriend
calls back real soon.

284
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,419
Where the hell is everybody?

285
00:24:57,786 --> 00:24:58,786
<i>Mami!</i>

286
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:06,091
Lookie here, good old Sucre.

287
00:25:06,094 --> 00:25:07,146
What did you do to them?

288
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,346
Where are they? Maricruz!

289
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,636
Keep your cap on.

290
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,225
They're out picking apples
for the Snuffleupagus.

291
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,843
- If you ever...
- Calm down!

292
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:17,022
They're going to walk back in here
any minute...

293
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,054
which means trouble.

294
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,997
Now, unless you want to see me try out

295
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:25,345
the new T-20Z on your
<i> bella muchacha</i>, Mari-poon.

296
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:28,642
I think you'd better come with me.

297
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:45,694
I understand you have something for me.

298
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:51,984
You still there?

299
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:53,235
<i>I'm here.</i>

300
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,199
It's good to finally talk to you.

301
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:59,388
Wish I had the chance
one of those 242 nights

302
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,989
<i>I spent on death row.</i>

303
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,062
Please, just play the tape.

304
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,797
<i>It's awful, I know.</i>

305
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:17,514
<i>But the choice was clear.</i>

306
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:20,521
<i>You need to be far away
from all of this.</i>

307
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:21,585
<i>I am.</i>

308
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,127
I'm the Isle of Terrence,

309
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:24,214
far off to sea.

310
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:26,132
<i>Look, I'm still here for you.</i>

311
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:30,016
<i>Now, listen to me.
Don't dwell on the negative.</i>

312
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:32,452
Some people deserve to dwell, Caroline.

313
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:35,328
You know I'm only a phone call away.

314
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,305
And 3,000 miles.

315
00:26:42,706 --> 00:26:43,786
Do you know

316
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:45,603
<i>how cold it is here?</i>

317
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,882
<i>We talked about this, Terrence.</i>

318
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,312
<i>You knew that you would be
lonely, but it's only temporary.</i>

319
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:53,815
<i>His appeals process has started already.</i>

320
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:56,386
<i>This is gonna fly by
quicker than your 20s.</i>

321
00:26:57,025 --> 00:27:00,255
<i>And soon the world
will forget all about him</i>

322
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:02,637
<i>and they'll forget about you, too.</i>

323
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:03,659
I promise.

324
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:04,876
But...

325
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,026
it's killing me

326
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:09,853
not being able to see you,

327
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,744
sweet Caroline.

328
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:13,333
I want to see you, too.

329
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,997
<i>But that can't happen right now.</i>

330
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:17,202
This house is so big.

331
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:18,916
I just think of you...

332
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,115
lying in bed...

333
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,802
I know. Me, too.

334
00:27:24,813 --> 00:27:26,414
Your warmth... your touch.

335
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:37,265
Was it quick

336
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:40,468
when he killed himself?

337
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:44,380
It was a lot quicker
than how my father died.

338
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:46,534
They shot him in the back.

339
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:49,367
He died in my arms.

340
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:52,884
I just want to know what happened.

341
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,607
Your brother apologized.

342
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:00,097
He said he was sorry,

343
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:03,253
and then he blew his brains out
all over the wall.

344
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:06,668
It was quick.

345
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,150
And it was his decision.

346
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:12,861
And now it's time for you to make yours.

347
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,939
You know, I can't do it.

348
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,244
I can't do that.

349
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:25,995
Yes, you can.

350
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,593
There's nothing to be afraid of.

351
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,348
You don't get it, do you?

352
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:33,611
You can't stop this guy.

353
00:28:34,806 --> 00:28:36,464
Not without your cooperation, I can't,

354
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,753
but if you talk to me,

355
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:40,816
if you tell me what's going on,

356
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:42,428
I can take care of you, okay?

357
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,562
You've got to trust me, Mr. Franklin.

358
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,564
I can help you.

359
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,146
C- Note, right?

360
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:53,850
Yeah. Whatever, man.

361
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,161
All I need you to do

362
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:03,878
is tell me exactly what
Agent Mahone told you.

363
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,996
If you give me Mahone,

364
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:08,513
I'll give you your life back.

365
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:12,852
God's been smiling down on me,
I can tell you that.

366
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,997
First, I caught up to
Haywire up in Algoma.

367
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:16,931
He did a swan dive off a grain elevator

368
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:19,328
before they could put him away,
but I still get the reward.

369
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:20,674
Wait, wait. He's dead?

370
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,402
Yep, like a gnat on a Peterbilt.

371
00:29:22,414 --> 00:29:24,143
Hope you don't take
the same route, Sucre.

372
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:25,843
Oh, hell no, I got plenty reasons
to live.

373
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:27,955
I hope a few of them are in Fox River.

374
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,301
And maybe, if you play nice,

375
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,049
I'll throw your Maricruz a couple bills

376
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:32,541
after I turn you in.

377
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:34,047
How much are you getting for this?

378
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:35,059
A hundred grand.

379
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,835
I bet you never thought your
ass'd be worth all that.

380
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:39,321
Wait, wait.

381
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:44,141
What if I know where you
can get five million dollars?

382
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,286
You hear me?

383
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:51,037
Where is it?

384
00:29:51,343 --> 00:29:52,620
I could take you there,

385
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:55,202
if you didn't have to take me
back to the States

386
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:56,272
and turn me back in.

387
00:29:58,051 --> 00:29:59,051
Where is it?

388
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:03,457
T- Bag's in town.

389
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:07,514
I made my commitment a long time ago.

390
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:12,917
I agreed to put my country
ahead of myself,

391
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:14,954
like a mother does for a child.

392
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:18,526
And I thought

393
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:23,906
that what I was doing was noble
and that I would be rewarded.

394
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,373
You were wrong.

395
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:28,782
Don't you see that
I'm a pawn in this, too?

396
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:34,395
The power that has taken over
this country is like a cancer,

397
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:36,422
and it will stop at nothing.

398
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,728
It is out of my control.

399
00:30:39,764 --> 00:30:40,764
So is this.

400
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,174
Tell me what you want from me.

401
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:46,717
Uncuff me.

402
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,872
I don't have the keys.

403
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:51,277
You'll get them.
Second, I want you to arrange

404
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:53,040
for me to walk away, alone.

405
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,451
No surveillance.

406
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:57,536
Okay.

407
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,683
And finally,

408
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:03,640
I want a presidential pardon for me

409
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:05,506
and my brother,

410
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,590
fully exonerating us of all our crimes.

411
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:11,584
And I want it today.

412
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,332
I can't just hand out pardons

413
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,672
to anyone I choose.

414
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,541
There is a process, rules.

415
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:24,813
This is no exception.

416
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:29,042
A document will be delivered
for your approval just like any pardon.

417
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
You'll sign it

418
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:32,257
and then file it
with the attorney general

419
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,369
who'll submit
to the presidential record.

420
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,721
Fine. I will sign
whatever you need me to sign.

421
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:40,125
That's very kind,
but we both know that's not enough.

422
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:42,982
What do you want from me?

423
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:46,205
I will unlock you myself,
walk you out of here.

424
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,639
What, you want me to drive you
to the airport?

425
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:52,140
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used
to be, especially with paperwork.

426
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:53,935
It's so easy to lose.

427
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,875
Now, I want you to go out there
in front of everyone and announce

428
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:01,037
our full pardon on live TV.

429
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,790
You're insane.

430
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:06,421
That is not the way things are done!

431
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:09,266
This is not a vacuum,
people will ask questions.

432
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:10,275
Pardon!

433
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:11,293
On stage!

434
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:12,297
Now!

435
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:18,014
And how do I know

436
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,907
that you won't release the tape
an hour later?

437
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,500
You don't.

438
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:27,720
You'll just have to take my word for it.

439
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,966
Well, I need more than that.

440
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,366
Well, you're not going to get it.

441
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,891
It's time.

442
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:43,245
Make your choice.

443
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:55,262
Adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee
and bring him here to be released.

444
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:57,827
What...

445
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,124
are you doing?

446
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:03,976
I am going to make an announcement
pardoning Mr. Scofield and his brother

447
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:06,279
and he will walk away unharmed.

448
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:08,164
Are you out of your mind?

449
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:12,630
He has brought
some indisputable evidence to light.

450
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:13,851
We could end this all.

451
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:15,806
Right now.

452
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:17,656
And you're gonna let them walk?

453
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:21,924
I am the commander in chief,
and you are a corporate lackey.

454
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:25,914
I am making the calls now.
You have no authority.

455
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:29,940
My men will see to it

456
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:31,978
that Mr. Scofield walks away

457
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,095
without the interference of you

458
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,957
and your pit bulls.

459
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,377
- You alone?
- Yeah.

460
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:14,395
How'd you do?

461
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,662
Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

462
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:17,845
Nice.

463
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:19,499
I owe you.

464
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:20,677
No, we're even.

465
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,791
- These are for you.
- Nice.

466
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,663
And this.

467
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,782
- What's this?
- Eddie,

468
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:31,423
when you broke out,
bet me a hundred bucks

469
00:34:31,424 --> 00:34:32,813
you'd be caught in a week.

470
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:34,560
I said, "No way. Not the Linc I know."

471
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:36,582
Figured I'd split it with you.

472
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:40,691
So this is it ?

473
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:42,913
Yeah.

474
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:45,492
Good luck.

475
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:50,012
- You take care.
- You, too. All right.

476
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
You be safe.

477
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,225
Your neck of the woods.

478
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:19,782
Yeah, how's Third and Racine?

479
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:20,812
I'll be there.

480
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:31,040
I don't want to do this, I really don't.

481
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:33,972
What are you,
what are you talking about?

482
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:35,955
You can't say
that I didn't give you a choice

483
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:38,348
but you, you know,
you never take the easy way, you...

484
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:40,923
And I noticed that about you, you...

485
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:45,582
I should never expect it to be
any different, but I have a job to do,

486
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,769
a job that I'm being made to do.

487
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:52,492
Pick it up, Sara.

488
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,084
Sara, pick it up.

489
00:35:56,055 --> 00:35:57,055
Pick up the phone!

490
00:35:57,142 --> 00:35:58,205
Wait, wait!

491
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Don't move.

492
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,470
Just...

493
00:36:04,187 --> 00:36:05,222
Don't move.

494
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,717
I need the phone.
Give me the phone.

495
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,420
Stay right where you are, please.

496
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:16,192
You don't really want to do this.

497
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:18,200
You don't know the first thing
about what I want.

498
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,870
Get my message?

499
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:39,226
<i>Yeah.</i>

500
00:36:42,274 --> 00:36:43,984
- I got her.
- She's on her way out.

501
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:47,738
<i>Follow her;
she'll take you right to Scofield.</i>

502
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:09,930
Sir...

503
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:12,079
we need to talk.

504
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:16,334
In just a few minutes,

505
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,341
the president

506
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,411
is going to announce a pardon

507
00:37:19,735 --> 00:37:21,123
for Burrows and Scofield.

508
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,717
As you're well aware,
this is quite a departure.

509
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:26,956
She's always been willing to play ball,

510
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:28,918
but I think
we need to take some sort of action.

511
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,599
Sir...

512
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:35,916
I hate to disturb you,

513
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,306
but I'm not sure you realize the gravity

514
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:41,251
of what she's about to do.

515
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:01,854
Michael.

516
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:02,904
Sara, it worked.

517
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,166
The pardon?

518
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,332
She's announcing it any minute.

519
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:11,972
Oh, my God.

520
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,902
Oh, my God. Michael, that's amazing.

521
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:17,772
<i>Just get here, Okay ?</i>

522
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:20,668
I'm on...

523
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:22,955
Highland.

524
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:25,100
It's a warehouse.
It runs right down to the water.

525
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,329
Yeah, I'm on my way.

526
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:07,725
We did it.

527
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:09,832
Yeah?

528
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:14,320
What happened to your face, man?

529
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,342
If you want to take the ride...

530
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:19,752
you got to buy the ticket.

531
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:23,302
Yeah, right.
Well, Derek hooked us up with a cabin

532
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:24,423
on one of those freighters.

533
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:26,508
South America via the Great Lakes.

534
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,389
We're not gonna need that, but,

535
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:31,524
this is appreciated.

536
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,258
One more time, bro.

537
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,385
We did it?

538
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
It's done.

539
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:38,679
We're done.

540
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,083
I...

541
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:44,509
I wish I could have seen
the look on her face.

542
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:47,075
No, you don't.

543
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:49,636
Oh, yeah, I do.

544
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:55,852
Unbelievable.

545
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:57,677
She's going to do it.

546
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:00,362
Unbelievable.

547
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:06,673
<i>The president is now taking the stage
here at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.</i>

548
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,474
<i>The two-hour delay in her appearance</i>

549
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,933
<i>due to an investigation characterized</i>

550
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:14,288
<i>by Press Secretary Ryan Berg
as "an overzealous fan..."</i>

551
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,470
You are not going to do this.

552
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,639
I'm afraid I am.

553
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,754
There are some developments
you need to be aware of.

554
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:28,051
I have made my decision.

555
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,072
And I would appreciate you
not second-guessing me.

556
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,079
I don't think you understand.

557
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:35,064
We know your secrets, too.

558
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:39,073
And we can reveal them just as easily.

559
00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:41,290
You need to ask yourself
who you fear more,

560
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,291
Michael Scofield?

561
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:44,380
Or us?

562
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,103
You got 30 seconds.

563
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:47,901
I won't keep you.

564
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,431
The world is waiting.

565
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:51,771
Ten seconds.

566
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:53,133
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

567
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:54,703
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

568
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:57,265
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

569
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,779
<i>six, five,</i>

570
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:02,579
<i>four, three,</i>

571
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:04,961
<i>two, one.</i>

572
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:09,917
Thank you for waiting so patiently
all afternoon.

573
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:14,850
If it were not for the support
of this great state,

574
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:17,146
my home state of Illinois...

575
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:23,849
<i>... I would not be here today.</i>

576
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:26,309
<i>Which is why I have chosen</i>

577
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,495
today to make
this very important announcement.

578
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:33,235
A situation

579
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,283
<i>has recently come to light,</i>

580
00:41:35,883 --> 00:41:38,465
<i>and I feel that I must take action.</i>

581
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:43,030
<i>It is my job as president
of this great country,</i>

582
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:48,598
<i>to make rational decisions
when I am given facts.</i>

583
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:53,763
Decisions that are best not for me,
but for the people.

584
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,549
And so,

585
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:00,407
after much consideration,

586
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:04,024
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

587
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,921
that I have been diagnosed

588
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:10,083
with a highly malignant form of cancer.

589
00:42:14,422 --> 00:42:16,583
<i>And because of that reason,</i>

590
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:19,200
<i>I am no longer fit</i>

591
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:22,008
to serve as your commander in chief.

592
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:26,015
In the best interest of this country,

593
00:42:26,016 --> 00:42:27,238
effective immediately,

594
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:32,326
I am stepping down as president

595
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:34,433
of the United States.

596
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,426
If she ain't the president,
the tape's useless.

597
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:46,340
She can't pardon anyone.

598
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:49,169
We got nothing.

599
00:42:54,535 --> 00:42:56,368
There's only one thing we can do.

600
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:00,287
We got to disappear...

601
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:03,346
forever.
