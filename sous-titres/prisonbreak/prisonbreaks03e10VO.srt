1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,870
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,370
How does a simple fishman

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,130
Know so much about the company?

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,220
You gonna do this or not?

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,310
Yes, but once we're out, I consider you collateral.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,440
Lincoln causes as many

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,810
Problems as he solves.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,180
He needs to get out of his own way, and I think

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,620
You can assist him. I stay one step ahead,

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,120
And you get 50 grand.

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,050
What happened?

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,380
She came up to me just like you said

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,930
And offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,000
So we stick to the plan, right?

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,020
Yeah. cool.

16
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,740
I found a passport. who's Gary Miller?

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,950
I've been working on a way for us to be together.

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,190
James, how-how can I believe you?

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,950
Hocan I believe anything anymore?

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,590
We got a way out of this?

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,400
We need some kind of support brace for thtunnel.

22
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,730
Or what? or the whole thing collapses, and we're buried alive.

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,830
No more excuses.

24
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,100
Papa's dead because of this yankee.

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,490
I'll kill him myself if I have to, all right?

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,850
He survived the box.

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,870
So what?

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,310
The guards went after Scofield.

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,650
Scofield won.

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,160
He's a folk hero now.

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,620
Look, I want Scofield dead as much as you,

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,820
But not at the cost of an uprising.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,050
Mail call.

34
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,890
Who's that?

35
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,750
That's my son.

36
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,460
Bagwell gave the okay. the coast is clear.

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,850
We gotta go.

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,880
I didn't think I'd see you again.

39
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,030
Once someone goes into the box, it's...

40
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,790
It was a misunderstanding.

41
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,120
They wanted to talk to you about the helicopters, right?

42
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,980
What helicopters?

43
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,090
Were you really trying to escape?

44
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,580
I don't know what you're talking about, and neither do you.

45
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,570
Just so you know, Bagwell's coming with us.

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,610
You were gone.

47
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,880
He had something we needed.

48
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,030
I didn't have a choice.

49
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,180
Fine.

50
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,610
So what's the new plan?

51
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,900
Did you tell him?

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,610
Yeah.

53
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,960
I am coming with you.

54
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,100
Okay by me.

55
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,990
Everyone hear that? you hear that, lawman?

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,150
But you're staying up here.

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,140
Maybe I didn't enunciate myself.

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,720
The work downstairs requires two hands.

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,640
Hey. we need somebody to stay outside in case Sammy returns.

61
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,830
I thought we couldn't dig through this stuff.

62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
The bracing's gonna be tricky.

63
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,830
Unless the tunnel gets the proper support,

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,580
It's all going to come down on our heads.

65
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,410
We should have the materials for the braces,

66
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,150
But we'll need a a saw to cut tto size. and a hammer.

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,750
Can you help us out?

68
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,340
Yeah. I can do that.

69
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,560
Two days.

70
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,180
And if not?

71
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,990
Two days.

72
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,170
Guillermo should have everything we need.

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,280
You know where he is, right?

74
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,200
I think it's, uh...

75
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,860
It's down this corridor on the left.

76
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,370
Halfway down. cell 40.

77
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,900
Down the corridor on the left.

78
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,940
Cell 40. okeydoke.

79
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,030
Are you lost already, Teodoro?

80
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,110
No.

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,970
But you are.

82
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,350
This is my room now.

83
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,900
You're done in here.

84
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,950
If you had gone after Scofield today,

85
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,720
All would have been forgiven.

86
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,750
This is suicide.

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,080
Shut up, old man!

88
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,020
I'll take my chances.

89
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,030
You think you can run sona?

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,870
You couldn't even run shipments from one dock to the other,

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,250
But I still keep you by my side.

92
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,130
I'll let you walk out of here

93
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,410
Out of respect for what you were.

94
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,380
Come on!

95
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,740
Get the hell out of here!

96
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,860
All of you ready to do this?

97
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,970
Until Lechero gets back,

98
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,170
We should start looking for pieces

99
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,730
About four feet in length.

100
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,030
I'm running things now!

101
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,380
Anyone got problem with that...

102
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
...come get it!

103
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,420
Good.

104
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,590
First order of business,

105
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,610
A case of rum to the man who brings me Michael Scofield!

106
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,440
Don't worry.

107
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,440
We'll be there with all the cash.

108
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,150
Okay? gracias.

109
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,590
Osberto. that's who you want to talk to.

110
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,020
This guy on the up-and-up?

111
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,750
The guy I was running things into sona for arranged this,

112
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,160
So it's as up as it's gonna get for this kind of deal. so, yes.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,590
Osberto doesn't speak english, though,

114
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,250
So how do you want to work it?

115
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,780
I need to meet with Susan.

116
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll take Sofia. she can translate for me.

117
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,530
Don't worry about it.

118
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,700
So when I meet with Susan, what do you want me to tell her?

119
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,960
Tell her whatever you think she wants to hear.

120
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,090
Just buy us enough time to do our thing, all right?

121
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,750
Home stretch, papi.

122
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,330
Listen, man. I want to thank you for everything.

123
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,690
Oh, linc, please. when we get home, I got your back--

124
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,280
Whatever you need, whatever you want.

125
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,860
That won't be necessary.

126
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,910
When I'm back home, I'm a saint.

127
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,420
I'm not even jaywalking.

128
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,100
Osberto. don't forget.

129
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,500
Osberto.

130
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,810
Scofield steps outside that tunnel, he's a dead man.

131
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,270
Far as I can tell, we have two options.

132
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,090
We can invite Sammy on the escape...

133
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,460
He can go to hell.

134
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,910
Which brings us to option number two.

135
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,500
You wouldn't last a second in there with Sammy.

136
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,690
Would you?

137
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,620
Then I guess we'll just have to outsource.

138
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,940
I felt sorry for the guy,

139
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,690
But you don't chicken-foot an ex-delta force

140
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,280
And expect to make it out alive.

141
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,630
You're delta force? like Chuck Norris?

142
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,160
Norris? he wouldn't have made it through boot camp.

143
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,500
Excuse me a second.

144
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,780
I see you're making friends.

145
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,090
Hey, once you get the hang of it,

146
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,530
This place ain't so rough.

147
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,060
Yeah. too bad.

148
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,280
Too bad what?

149
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,080
You were right. we got

150
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,840
A little plan going on. but, you know, if you're putting down roots...

151
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,220
No, no. you were saying...?

152
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,920
We're supposed to be out of here in 48 hours.

153
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,500
Not through Scofield.

154
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,810
You heard the town crier.

155
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,980
College boy's life is barely worth a case of booze.

156
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,900
Hence our current conversation.

157
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,080
I know how you got your cherry yesterday,

158
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,240
Daubing your wraps in acetone,

159
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,370
Smothering the guy until he passed out from the fumes.

160
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,360
You do the same thing to Sammy, and you're in.

161
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,420
Chicken-foot Sammy?

162
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,520
Chicken-foot Sammy.

163
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,430
It's all riding on you, champ.

164
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,870
Here you get it.

165
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,090
Thank you.

166
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,340
This shouldn't take long.

167
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,650
What are you getting?

168
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,340
Supplies. for?

169
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,830
I don't want to get caught flat-footed again.

170
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,020
You know no.what that means?

171
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,460
Well, these people obviously have a plan.

172
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,650
We're gonna need one, too.

173
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,790
Does that plan include screwing over James?

174
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,780
Is it James or gary Miller?

175
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,620
Whatever his name is, there's a part of me

176
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,490
That doesn't want to believe he works for them...

177
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:55,730
Cause he's

178
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,910
The man I loved,

179
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,520
The man who went to prison for me,

180
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,170
The man who was going to take me to my first trip to paris.

181
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,110
I haven't turned my back to that man.

182
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,720
Do I have your word that he's gonna be all right?

183
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,440
Yeah. now get in.

184
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,020
Do I have your word?!

185
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,230
Yeah, you got my word.

186
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,650
Now get in.

187
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,630
Ed, we'll be in contact soon. Sales are through the roof!

188
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,500
Hope you're working on your putting...Gary

189
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,880
You know what st found out?

190
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,090
That "Sucre" means "sugar."

191
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,720
Yeah.

192
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,820
So every time I say your name,

193
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,310
I'm calling you "sugar."

194
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,090
Basically.

195
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,590
I like that.

196
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,260
Look, I don't have a lot of information.

197
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,280
Which, I guess, that's good ws for you, right?

198
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,430
You care to elaborate?

199
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,160
Lincoln isn't cooking anything up.

200
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,240
He's still planning on exchanging Whistler for lj.

201
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,230
He hasn't been talking about running any games.

202
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,150
And did he become an eagle scout last night, too?

203
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,490
Lady, he got the message. he knows he doest have

204
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
A choice, he has to play it straight.

205
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,820
Look, I could have come up here and made something up

206
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,140
Just to get paid, but...

207
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,430
I'm not trying to get on your bad side either.

208
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,610
You know what?

209
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,020
I believe you.

210
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,980
So, I'll call you if anything comes up.

211
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,720
Whoa, whoa! what am i, a toothless crack whore?

212
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,000
Sit down.

213
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,160
I keep my promises.

214
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,520
The people I work for, they don't like

215
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,340
To deal in greenbacks; it's just too bulky.

216
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,040
Cashier's check payable to cash. same thing.

217
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,760
Half now and half when you're done.

218
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,390
Keep your ears open, sugar.

219
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,970
Alex, come on!

220
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,890
Hold it steady! I am! I am!

221
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,570
I'm gonna need a little help here!

222
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,870
Come on.

223
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,300
I got it. I said I got it.

224
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,800
Thittle piece of metal's gonna hold all this weight?

225
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,280
All right,

226
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,590
Let go, let go.

227
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,190
So, how many more are we gonna need

228
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,500
Before we get to the top?

229
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,050
20 maybe.

230
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,660
That gets us to no-man's land. then what?

231
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,970
Helicopter'd be nice.

233
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,790
I was supposed to kill you.

234
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,580
Oh, so you're not a fisherman?

235
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,770
They threatened to come after my family

236
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,010
If I didn't kill you and jump on that helicopter,

237
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,530
But I didn't.

238
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,830
I'm so grateful.

239
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,420
So what happened to your family?

240
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,330
I don't know. maybe I'll find out if we ever get out of here.

241
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,990
Well, it's a crazy world, isn't it?

242
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,430
We all agreen that.

243
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,410
And we have a lot of work to do.

244
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,550
Where the hell is Lechero?

245
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,010
Is everything set? huh?

246
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,820
Is everything set?

247
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,250
Yeah, noblemo.

248
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
Excuse me, sir.

249
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,200
Do we come to you if we need the chicken foot?

250
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,140
Tiger pants.

251
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,310
Who you got a beef with?

252
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,600
I don't know his name. some caribbean guy.

253
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,570
Stole my wallet a while back.

254
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,590
Better think long and hard

255
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,720
Before you say another word, eh?

256
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,090
He's got this fruity little mustache

257
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,850
And this ly-ass vest.

258
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,170
Please, I'm beggin' ya.

259
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,720
In the ring. 15 minutes.

260
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,170
I never thought I'd say this,

261
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,860
But I envy you, Brad. I've wanted

262
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,500
To shank that little calypso kid

263
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,810
Ever since I first met him. I'm not a violent guy by nature,

264
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,150
But if a man makes me walk around in my grunts for two days...

265
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,290
Yeah, that's great. just don't take too long to finish him off, okay?

266
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,030
The sooner he's dead, the sooner we can get on the escape.

267
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,610
No games. I'm in.

268
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,670
You're in.

269
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,100
No, no, no. what's wrong?

270
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,600
We got to call off the fight.

271
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,030
No, that's an impossibility.

272
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,790
No, no, no,

273
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,110
You don't understand!

274
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,220
There's got to be more acetone around here.

275
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,640
No, that's it! I can't go against

276
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,270
Sammy straight up! I'm a dead man!

277
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
If you don't kill him, we are all dead.

278
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,900
This isn't the best neighborhood.

279
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,970
I've been in a lot worse.

280
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,260
Just stick close.

281
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,210
Osberto?

282
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,030
Si.

283
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,840
You want to do this?

284
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,380
iene el dinero?

285
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,600
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

286
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,030
onde esta?

287
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,720
"where is the money?"

289
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,850
I want to see the product.

291
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,080
Primero el dinero.

292
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,940
"money first."

293
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,040
Show me the stuff.

294
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,270
El dinero!

295
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,810
Lincoln, please, let's get out of here.

296
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,190
Tell him to stop wasting my time.

297
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,200
No.

298
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,750
Tell him.

300
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,510
Oh, my god!

301
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,280
Big? it's grande?

302
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,060
Si.

303
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,620
Ask him how do I trigger it by remote.

306
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,250
Boom.

307
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,600
"dial one-one, send."

308
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,840
One-one, send?

310
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,960
Adios.

311
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,130
Adios.

312
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,360
Buena suerte.

313
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,500
Why didn't you tell me you were gonna buy a bomb?

314
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,370
You never d have come otherwise.

315
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,030
We need that saw.

316
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,610
You know, uh,

317
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,330
I am a fisherman.

318
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,850
I am. I'm just maybe

319
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,600
A little bit more connected than I've let on.

321
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,080
I think this is gonna work.

322
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,130
Yeah.

323
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,080
You know, I run charters, just like I said...

324
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,370
I have for years.

325
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,460
Then one day, that brunette, Gretchen well, she asked me

326
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,860
If I wanted to be exclusive to her corporation, right?

327
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,460
And, uh, well, with the money she was offering,

328
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,590
I had a pretty good idea she wasn't

329
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,910
Just trawling for salmon.

330
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,210
So you two have history.

331
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,290
Yeah. and she's

332
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,110
Been an absolute nightmare in my life

333
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,770
Ever since that first job.

334
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,790
Alex, I need a wedge.

335
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,470
Wedge.

336
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,890
Look, I took 'em where they wanted me to take 'em.

337
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,170
I have to figure outhese coordinates

338
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,490
And I have to take them back there.

339
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,840
Quit embarrassing yourself.

340
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,980
What?

341
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,930
We're not two chicks at a bar you're trying to pick up.

342
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,920
This?

343
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,220
No. all right, good. you work for the company.

344
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,430
And when you break out of here, you're gonna do whatever

345
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,680
The company asks you to do,

346
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,480
Period. well, they're using me

347
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,810
Just like they're g you.

348
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,330
Good, I'm glad you shared that with me.

349
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,220
So why don't we go back to work? how's that sound?

350
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,760
Let those idiots chickenfoot themselves all they want, huh?

351
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,600
But if one of them tries to use it on us...

352
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,290
You don't have to fight that guy.

353
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
It's my farewell tour.

354
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,110
The rest of those pieces are no good.

355
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,050
We're going to need those tools, Michael.

356
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,540
I guess we'll just have to wait.

357
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,520
That book of yours-- it's just a bunch

358
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,730
Of coordinates in there, right?

359
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,490
Among other things.

360
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,460
So you wouldn't mind.

361
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,520
It's just a bunch of, uh, numbers and dates.

362
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,740
"gate."

363
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,360
Gate netting company.

364
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,980
That's where I rent my trammels.

365
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,610
"stampede."

366
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,070
That's my buddy's cape islander.

367
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,700
And this is important to us how?

368
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,510
It's important because I'm being accused

369
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,940
Of being someone I'm not. and I don't want

370
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,100
Scofield ditching me

371
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,310
Once it's time to leave... he's not ditching anybody.

372
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,680
If he could have gotten rid of anybody,

373
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,980
He would have gotten rid of me.

374
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,390
And if he tries to leave the city

375
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,050
He knows that we're gonna turn him in before he gets out

376
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,700
Of the city. I'm going upstairs to find Lechero and his equipment.

377
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,160
I'm with Alex.

378
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,300
Do you mind?

379
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,700
Sounds like someone's up there.

380
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,260
If Lechero gets stranded up there,

381
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,380
We're not getting out of here.

382
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,930
So when you think it's safe,

383
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,870
Or it feels like

384
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,010
It's safe, we got to go, we got to go up.

385
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,670
We've been talking about chickenfooting Sammy for months.

386
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,750
No one had the courage.

387
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,690
Do you have any paint thinner?

388
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,920
Paint thinner?

389
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,060
Shoe polish,

390
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,970
Lighter fluid, glue?

391
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,060
There you are, champ.

392
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,940
It's time. stomp his face, Brad!

393
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,760
You know, this has all been one big misunderstanding.

394
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,420
I wasn't talking about Sammy.

395
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,080
It was... that's him.

396
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,820
That's the guy I was talking about.

397
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,630
Yeah, I don't see no "fruity moustache,"

398
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,500
And where's his "ugly-ass vest," Brad?

399
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,280
Don't worry, you stand a real chance of winning this one.

400
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,870
You cannot just hide out all day.

401
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
What else can I do, huh?

402
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,100
I've ruledhese men for a year with blood.

403
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,800
You don't think those men want to take the head of the man

404
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,990
Who wore the crown? be that as it may,

405
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,580
Bellick is about to lose his head to Sammy.

406
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,170
You may not want to hear this,

407
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,810
But once that happens, we are both very much

408
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,200
Aware that Scofield is gonna start

409
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,690
Getting curious about where the hell you are.

410
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,450
He's going to come crawling out of his hole

411
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,560
And right into Sammy's arms,

412
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,600
And then he and our escape

413
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,170
Are gone forever.

414
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,820
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,

415
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,490
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,

416
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,730
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,

417
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,140
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,

418
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,700
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick...

419
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,690
Wait. we get the tools and we come straight back.

421
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,960
Come on 

422
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,130
Hey.

423
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,350
You guys want to watch the fight?

425
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,470
You know, chill out.

426
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,930
I'll get you a beer.

427
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,370
You like that?

428
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,230
You like that?

430
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,260
Stop it.

431
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,650
Scofield!

432
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,060
Scofield's in there.

433
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,220
It's locked. open the door.

434
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,990
I don't have the combination.

435
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,650
I said...

436
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,180
Open it now.

437
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,020
Do it.

438
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,650
We can't.

439
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,910
We can't.

440
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,830
Open it now.

441
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,530
I don't have the combination.

442
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,270
I've got your man out here.

444
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,870
If you don't open the door,

445
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,990
He's the one who's going to pay the price.

446
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,990
I need him alive!

447
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,260
You saw those guys. what do you think they've got planned?

448
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,290
All of you is trying my patience.

449
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,050
What do you suggest, Alex?

450
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,120
Let's be ready for them.

451
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,210
Time's up.

452
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,620
You want another one?

453
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,900
Then you better be persuasive.

454
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,520
Michael.

455
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,540
Don't open the door!

456
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,120
He's got a gu...!

457
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,210
Are you going to tell me what it's for? no.

458
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,250
Because you think I might tell James?

459
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,680
Because you don't need to know.

460
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,280
Hey.

461
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,220
It's going to be all right.

462
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,750
How'd it go? good. I told her what she wanted to hear,

463
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Just like you told me.

464
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,840
That it? yeah.

465
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,100
Cool. listen, I want you to call her up,

466
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,440
Tell her you've got some information.

467
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,890
Make sure she picks you up, and get in the car, all right?

468
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,590
Okay. is everything okay?

469
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,040
Yeah. why?

470
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,300
She looks upset.

471
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,360
I'll call you later.

472
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,390
Got something down here we can use, Michael.

473
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,350
If they come through that door...

474
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,670
You hit 'em right here.

475
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,410
Go ahead, take it.

476
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,200
Go ahead.

477
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,890
It'll puncture the heart.

478
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,480
You were hiding

479
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,930
Scofield in your room?

480
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,240
Look at you-- the power make you mad already.

481
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,310
Come along, Norman.

482
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,820
Let's go.

483
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,360
What is so urgent?

484
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,520
Lincoln bought a gun.

485
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,700
I... I asked him what he planned on doing with it,

486
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,000
But he wouldn't answer.

487
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,110
So I just... I just thought you might want to know.

488
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,750
If anything changes, I'll get back to you, okay?

489
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,940
You ow, the other day

490
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,180
When you and lincoln had your little spat in the lobby

491
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,690
And you-- all distraught and jilted--

492
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,100
Went across the street to the bar,

493
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,910
A cynic might think that was staged.

494
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm a cynic, sugar.

495
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,570
You're high, sugar.

496
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,160
If it's any comfort, you guys almost pulled it off.

497
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,980
The puerto rican and the gorilla--

498
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,310
You really had me scrambling there for a minute.

499
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,330
Hey, if you don't want my help, fine, I'm out, okay?

500
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,980
It's a little thing called a tracing number--

501
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,490
On the check I gave you.

502
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,440
Apparently your extensive expertise

503
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,610
In banking

504
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,910
Failed you that day.

505
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,180
You promptly wired all 25 k

506
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,670
To maricruz delgado

507
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,900
In chicago

508
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,780
At 123 please don't hurt me lane.

509
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,320
I swear to god, if something happens to her...

510
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,620
If what?!

511
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,310
What, jackass?!

512
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,320
You're going to go back there and you're going to get me

513
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,700
Some real information,

514
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,410
Or Maricruz and her head are going to part ways.

515
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,870
Get out of my car.

516
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,750
Now.

517
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,720
Hey, Blanco.

518
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,670
I got your good buddy Lechero here.

519
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,680
Why don't you give it the secret knock so he knows it's you, huh?

520
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,370
The combination.

521
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,050
What makes you think I have the combination?

522
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,140
Just do what he says. huh?

523
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,300
How many times you gonna pull that little thing out?

524
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,720
As many times as I feel necessary.

526
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,440
What, you think it make you look strong?

527
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,100
All it does is magnify your weakness.

528
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,860
Funny, I'm feeling pretty

529
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,370
Secu right about now.

530
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,150
Now, the combination, old man. we're not asking again.

531
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,480
Sammy!

532
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,840
I'm opening the door.

533
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,240
Michael, do not open the...

534
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,140
Drop 'em!

535
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,610
Drop them, I sai

536
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,360
Now move!

537
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,380
You're escaping with him?

538
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,360
I was gonna tell you all about this, bredda.

539
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,620
It just never camep, eh?

540
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,020
Take it.

541
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,290
It's yours.

542
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,170
The tunnel,

543
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,710
The escape plan, everything.

544
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,150
We can go together.

545
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm taking everything you t.

546
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,860
But you ain't going nowhere.

547
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,810
How you finishing up this hole?

548
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,960
Promise me you'll take Whistler with you.

549
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,520
You making demands on me?

550
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,780
Hu

551
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,070
I understand...

552
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,180
Why you're going to kill me,

553
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,680
But he's done nothing wrong.

554
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,350
I'll tell you everything you need to know,

555
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,630
Just take him with you.

556
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,600
You need him.

557
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,040
He's the only one who figured this one out.

558
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,320
Don't you worry, I'll take care of yoriend.

559
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,060
All right.

560
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,960
First, you need to keep building braces

561
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,720
To support the tunnel as you go.

562
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,880
How you do that?

563
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,340
Whistler can show you how.

564
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,900
Look like you just

565
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,010
Make some wood squares from these boxes here.

566
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,440
Like I said,

567
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,700
Whistler can show you.

568
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,000
How much further to the surface?

569
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,020
Not far.

570
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,630
Can't be more than ten feet.

571
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,200
Impressive, Blanco.

572
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,730
Too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.

573
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,650
How long is this going to set us back?

574
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,840
What's gonna set us back is if the tower guards are looking at

575
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,640
A giant sinkhole out in no man's land.

576
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,620
Michael?

577
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,160
We're good.

578
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,420
Yeah.

579
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,750
We're good.

580
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,720
Back in business.

581
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,730
I'm in.

582
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,440
For what, getting your ass kicked?

583
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,010
I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops.

584
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,190
You're in, champ.

585
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,260
Okay, you need to stay here.

586
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,770
I got to get something, all right?

587
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,900
Don't move.

588
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,640
Can you get home from here?

589
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,460
Yeah, I'm two blocks away.

590
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,730
If he doesn't take you, I will.

591
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,100
Here.

592
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,290
Use this.

593
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,350
Thanks.

594
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,560
Right there.

595
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,610
You know, for all the times you wanted me

596
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,100
To prove I was a fisherman,

597
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,340
I should have been asking if you were a real engineer.

598
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,510
That could've been one of us buried down there.

599
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,820
I'll do bett next time.

600
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,790
I'm gonna go back down and try to salvage some of those braces.

601
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,130
Yeah, I'll go with you.

602
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,090
Never gets any easier.

603
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,710
Scofield, visita.

604
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,170
Scofield, visita.

605
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,070
All the side jobs I do at Sona for three years. I save all of my money.

606
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,810
It's $173.

607
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,600
If you're really leaving, it's yours.

608
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,040
Take me with you.

609
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,460
Please?

610
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,760
I don't want to be here anymore.

611
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,900
You don't want any part of this.

612
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,950
You got a plan or are we back to square one?

613
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,600
I have a plan. good, 'cause I got something cooking on tutside.

614
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,640
I ain't walking into a buzzsaw again.

615
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,640
How you dealing with the animals in here?

616
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,550
Actually, it's starting to feel like home.

617
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,110
Whistler still pretending he's a fisherman and all this?

618
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,190
Why? Sofia found a passport in one of the apartments he kept.

619
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,540
Name's Gary Miller.

620
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,650
I'm shocked. guy's a fraud, michael.

621
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,170
As far as I know, there ain't fish in Scottsdale.

622
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,200
Well, if he's not a fisherman... what is he?
