1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,200
meet sarah carver.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,010
Three months ago,
sarah's husband andrew was killed.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,540
They'd been married a little over a year.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,990
Remember the plane crash that killed richard billings,
the real estate mogul?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,700
The press called him the west coast's donald trump.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,900
Well,andrew was billings's lawyer 

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,720
and one of the four others also killed.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,240
They were at 30,000 feet when the blowout occurred.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,830
Passengers and pilots passed out in just seconds.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,010
Died a few minutes later from oxygen deprivation.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,350
The autopilot sailed their ghost ship out to sea,

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,400
where it ran out of fuel and crashed.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,450
It's not such a bad way to go,
really...quick,painless.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,600
Except maybefor the four others.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,070
Tough to die with somebody famous

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,880
because their death 
is the only one everybody remembers.

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,200
Well,almost everybody.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,670
The hard truth,the hardest of all, maybe,

19
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,390
is that behind everybody we love 
lies the inevitability of their loss.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,130
But that knowledge doesn't make it any easier
when they're gone,

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,390
and you're left alone,
trying to come to terms with what's lost.

22
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,020
- you told me to be patient. 
- Sarah...

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,980
you said let the ntsb investigate.

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,870
And if they didn't find anything,
you'd look into it.

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,050
What if they're right?

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,410
Do you know how often a fatal plane crash
occurs in this country?

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,360
One in every 4 million departures.

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,070
Billings was receiving death threats.

29
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,110
Then a few weeks later,his plane goes down?

30
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,890
You think that's a coincidence?

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm not even sure we have jurisdiction.

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,030
Yeah,the plane was based in santa monica,
it crashed in the pacific.

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,440
I doubt anybody's gonna fight us on it.

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,600
I just don't think--

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,770
if your wife was killed,
you'd wanna know why.

36
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,210
Right?

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,450
You owe me this much.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,260
Both of you.

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,030
Hey,carolyn.

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,090
Who's that?

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,940
Her name's sarah carver.

42
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,920
What's she doingwith lewis and raines?

43
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,360
Her husband was killed 
when richard billings' plane crashed.

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,110
As of this morning,
they ruled the crash an accident.

45
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,650
Okay,so she's a widow?

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,660
I'm gonna pretend you didn't just say that.

47
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,580
What? You think it's too soon?

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,980
I think I'm losing the small bitof respect I had for you.

49
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,680
And I think you should forget about her.

50
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,330
Why's that? Because you wanna keep me all to yourself?

51
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,180
Sarah's raines' ex-wife.

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,020
she's wrong.

56
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,290
You don't owe her anything.

57
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,830
No,that's not why I want this case.

58
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,820
Oh,come on,michael,this isn't about a case.

59
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,540
This is about a woman who needs closure,

60
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,170
and I'm a captain 
who needs his best detective here solving murders,

61
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,770
not investigating something the ntsb has already¡ª

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,410
who don't conduct criminal investigations.

63
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,570
Has already decided was an accident.

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,700
There's also the conflict of interest to consider.

65
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,650
Why don't you tell me 
what's really bothering you about this.

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,810
Okay.

67
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,110
Do you remember what you were like when she left?

68
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,840
I should've bought stock in jim beam.

69
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,190
I can't have you going through that again.

70
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,010
Not on top of everything else.

71
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,020
Everything else?

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,750
I'm sorry,

73
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,450
were you speaking to me just then 
or were you talking to yourself?

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,140
Um,it's been almost,uh,four years since she left.

75
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,470
And those feelings are dead.

76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,140
You're not the only cop in L.A.

77
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,340
No,but I'm the only one who'll do it right.

78
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,610
How's it hanging,guy?

79
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,250
Uh,just--just fine,thanks.

80
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,250
Word is you're investigating
your ex-wife's husband's death.

81
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,000
How'd you get saddled with that?

82
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,830
I volunteered,actually.

83
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,910
Wow,you're a better man than I.

84
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,990
I'd have told her to go stick it.

85
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,590
How kind of you.

86
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,330
But maybe I can give you a hand.

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,150
I take it you don't mean that literally.

88
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,480
Not this second,no.

89
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,590
While I appreciate the offer,
I'd rather handle this one solo,

90
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,410
if it's all the same to you.

91
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,450
You sure about that?

92
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,680
Yeah,very sure.

93
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,740
Never been so sure of anything in my entire life.

94
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,300
Then why am I here?

95
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,470
I don't know...

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,530
andrew.

97
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,370
And I don't imagine you can tell me.

98
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,120
I need everything you can find on richard billings:

99
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,260
Projects,threats,wife,lovers,enemies,competitors.

100
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,480
Anything that might providea motive
for tampering with his plane.

101
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,530
You take the ntsb: What wentwrong with the plane?

102
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,040
Why? Who might be to blame?

103
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,850
Every aspect of the crash,pilots,mechanics,everything.

104
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,620
No problem,boss.

105
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,910
And me,I'm gonna start at andrew carver's office.

106
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,010
I like that.

107
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,960
- Hey,what's the nt--  
- national transportation safety board.

108
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Thanks.

109
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,480
I never could please her the way you did.

110
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,620
You know,physically.

111
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,740
She always talked about what an attentive lover you were.

112
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,850
And how pathetic is it 
that you're actually making me say this?

113
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,880
This doesn't have to be personal.

114
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,790
Let's just figure out what happened,shall we?

115
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,520
What happened is you're a workaholic,
emotionally distant,

116
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,030
and sarah couldn't take it.

117
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,380
I meant what happened with the crash.

118
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,420
The crash?

119
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,450
Oh,come on.

120
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,020
You're only working this case 
as an excuse to get close to her.

121
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,470
Hey,if you recall,she came to me.

122
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,510
You actually think you'll solve the case,
save the day,and win her back,don't you?

123
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,340
That's ridiculous.

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,260
My interests here are purely professional.

125
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,800
Try being a little less defensive.

126
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,930
I'm not defensive.

127
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,140
Saying you're not defensiveis being defensive.

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,130
She had to marry a lawyer.

129
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,210
Marshall brekken.

130
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,560
Raines,lapd.

131
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,490
As you know,I'm looking into the circumstances
surrounding a plane crash

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,900
that killed one of your colleagues,andrew carver.

133
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,770
Well,that was three months ago.

134
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,100
- I'm aware. 
- So why now?

135
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,570
Has new information surfaced?

136
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,590
Not yet,no.

137
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,500
Well,however I can help.

138
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,900
In what capacity was andrew working for billings?

139
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,940
He was overseeing contracts
and negotiations for richard.

140
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,330
Was your firm aware that billings' life
was being threatened?

141
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,160
We were.

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,870
But we'd been told that the threats
were being handled within his organization.

143
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,670
Aside from his associations with billings,

144
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,620
was there anything
that might have made andrew a target?

145
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,100
Bad blood,debts,shady associates?

146
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,220
No.

147
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,900
You sure?

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,550
You didn't know andrew.

149
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
Enlighten me.

150
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,830
He got into college on a baseball scholarship,

151
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,720
paid his way through law school bartending,

152
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,430
and still finished in the top ten of his class at usc.

153
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,410
Don't cop that attitude,
it's a better school than you think.

154
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,210
And top ten is top ten.

155
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,730
Detective?

156
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,450
Go on,I'm fascinated.

157
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,880
He made partner at 33.

158
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,580
Worked hard,was in shape,recently married.

159
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,440
Always took care of the people around him.

160
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,520
And marched for greenpeace 
and was a volunteer fireman,right?

161
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,760
Selling andrew as a choirboy doesn't help me.

162
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,480
I need to know what might've gotten him killed.

163
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,300
Objection. Leading.

164
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,420
He never had a losing client who held a grudge?

165
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,100
Andrew didn't make a habit of losing.

166
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,430
What about his personal relationships?

167
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,650
Anyone in this firm will attest to his character.

168
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,590
How would you characterize his marriage?

169
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,010
He was very much in love.

170
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,540
No chance he was,uh,messing around?

171
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,530
Objection!

172
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,310
Relevance?

173
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,420
I don't see how that's relevant.

174
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
It's called jealousy.

175
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,770
I'm guessing that 
it pays a fair amount of the bills around here.

176
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,990
No.

177
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,770
What about her?

178
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,760
This is absurd.

179
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,040
What's absurd is that your friend,
an esteemed colleague,is dead.

180
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,640
And you can't contribute a single useful fact
to this investigation.

181
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,280
Andrew didn't love working for billings,
but he did what he had to.

182
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,360
And the money the account brought in freed us up
to do other things.

183
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,080
Yes,yes,you guys are doing real charity work over here.

184
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,920
Drew wasn't perfect.

185
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,350
But he was a great guy.

186
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,990
And you can't imagine how hard it is to have him gone.

187
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,210
Now,if you have some real questions,
I'm happy to help.

188
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,690
But if your intention is to try
and smear the man's memory...

189
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,980
do it somewhere else.

190
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,810
What?

191
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,950
Oh,now I can't even have a conversation with myself?

192
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,740
Sure you can,just pull out your phone 
and pretend you're talking to a real person.

193
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,600
What's your problem-- 
I mean,my problem--I mean¡ª

194
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,420
you don't think some of those questions
were slightly inappropriate?

195
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,300
Nobody ever volunteers,"the guy was a wife beater,
and I'm glad he's dead."

196
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,760
Romanticized memories don't help.

197
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,530
You just don't want to accept that
I wasn't some rich schmuck lawyer.

198
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,470
I'd be happy to,if I heard something
that made me think otherwise.

199
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,070
I thought you just did.

200
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,710
Billings was lobbying city council
to use eminent domain to

201
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,790
seize and tear down almost 100 housesin bell gardens,
southeast of downtown.

202
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,980
A report said he was attempting to position the land
as a site for a new football stadium.

203
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,520
Great,so there wereonly a few hundred people
who wanted this guy dead.

204
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,780
Find out who was spearheading the protest. 
What else?

205
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,020
Billings' wife,angelina,is an actress.

206
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,640
Really?

207
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,960
Anything I'd know?

208
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,010
She played drake van houghton's wife
on paradise island.

209
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,480
Right. Anyway.

210
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,160
She,uh,inherited the bulk of his considerable assets.

211
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,340
Let's do a full profile on,uh,
the no doubt extremely talented mrs.Billings.

212
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,740
And one carlton hayworth replaced billings as ceo.

213
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,920
I'm trying to get him
to come down here for an interview,

214
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,110
but his secretary keeps stonewalling me.

215
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,970
Really?

216
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,000
Next time you call,
make sure the secretary understands

217
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,470
how embarrassing it is 
when cops show up at the ceo's office.

218
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,950
Uh,permission to speak freely,soldier.

219
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,480
Okay,the plane was
returning to santa monica from sacramento.

220
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,910
And apparently they lost radio contact around modesto.

221
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,220
National guard planes scrambled out of fresno,

222
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,730
visually confirmed that the plane's windows were iced,

223
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,770
and that there was a lack of cabin movement.

224
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,160
Did the ntsb comment on the chances of foul play?

225
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,310
Oh,yeah,absolutely.

226
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,420
They said that if you were gonna sabotage a plane,

227
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,700
that a valve or a seal would be a good way to go.

228
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,060
Because,you know,between the,um...

229
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,500
how hard the plane hits...

230
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,390
the impact's force?

231
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,840
Yeah,and the,uh,water deepness?

232
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,310
Ocean's depth?

233
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,900
Right,there's almost no sign of wreckage.

234
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,590
So,can't prove sabotage.

235
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,760
And no way to prove there wasn'T.

236
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,870
Who was the head mechanic in charge of billings's plane?

237
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,660
Craig fuhlman,detective.

238
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,240
Been head of operations for the last three years.

239
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,450
What does that entail,exactly?

240
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,610
Maintenance,parts,scheduling,personnel,you name it.

241
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,860
So you oversaw the work on billings's plane?

242
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,760
I dropped out of college when I was 19.

243
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,750
Got my training as a mechanic.

244
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,720
The first plane 
I ever worked on was billings' cessna citation.

245
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,370
I've known the man nearly half my life.

246
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,110
So,yeah,I oversaw the work on his plane.

247
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,250
What happened?

248
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,320
Wish I knew.

249
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,070
Flow valve,seal-- it's hard to say.

250
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,530
The ntsb cleared your outfit.

251
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,210
It doesn't matter what the ntsb said.

252
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
What do you mean?

253
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,050
Whatever happened,it's because we missed something.

254
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,720
Well,you think a member of your team,
uh,might have been at fault?

255
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,760
Well,we were cleared,but...

256
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,740
doesn't mean we don't all feel the loss.

257
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,810
One way or another,we'll always wonder what happened.

258
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,330
I know that billings was heading back 
from sacramento when the plane went down.

259
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Is it possible that somebody up there tampered with it,
or...

260
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,250
I suppose,though I don't know why they'd have reason.

261
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,860
Detective boyer speaking.

262
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,680
Yeah,this is raines.

263
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,630
I need you to go up to sacramento and interview
the mechanics that handled billings's plane.

264
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,550
You're joking,right?

265
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,860
No,a joke would be if I said 
I'm really glad to have you on this case.

266
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,590
Sacramento's like a six-hour drive.

267
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,670
Yeah,drive up today,you can be back tomorrow.

268
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,630
And,uh,when you come back,I hope you've changed.

269
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,880
We were happy. You don't know.

270
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,320
I'm sure you were.

271
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,930
But things change,mike.

272
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,450
She'd moved up.

273
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,560
It's about finding the place that fits.

274
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,070
This place just fit her better.

275
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,080
It's a nice place.

276
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,410
Don't start this again.

277
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,910
Start what again?

278
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,510
No,no,I-I'M...

279
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,360
I was merely commenting on what a nice home you had.

280
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,940
- Really? 
- Yeah,of course. 

281
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,450
Why? W-what'd you think I meant?

282
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,930
Never mind.

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,450
You're not gonna feel better about yourself
until she's in tears,are you?

284
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,690
I just thought that you always hated
that andrew was a lawyer.

285
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,390
You resented that he made money doing a job
that you considered insignificant.

286
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,350
Hey,you--you said it.

287
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,450
So you just meant "nice house."

288
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
Yeah,I did.

289
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,300
Fine.

290
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,120
How can I help?

291
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,660
I was curious about whether you 
and andrew were ever subjected to threats.

292
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,190
They were directed primarily to billings and his family.

293
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Oh,I see.

294
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,830
Uh,did andrew ever talk about who he thought
might be behind them,anybody specific?

295
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,500
No.

296
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,010
Had he hired anybody to look into it?

297
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,590
I don't know.

298
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,430
Did you talk to billings' people about all this?

299
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,550
Of course not.

300
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,630
Um,uh,we're working on it.

301
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,890
Billings' wife?

302
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm trying to gather information about the threats
before confronting a possible suspect.

303
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,700
Look,if I knew anything,
I would've told you at the station.

304
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,770
Andrew didn't talk about it.

305
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,730
Hated bringing work home with him.

306
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,970
That must've been a nice change for you.

307
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,820
Don't do this.

308
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,450
This isn't about us,michael.

309
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,180
No,it's not.

310
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,580
It seems to be about billings
cheating people out of their homes,

311
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,930
and your husband helping him to do it.

312
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,890
But what would you care,
as long as it provided you with,uh,all this.

313
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,820
I knew it.

314
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,940
Unbelievable.

315
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,660
How could you have been this naive?

316
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,980
Didn't you realize what they were doing?

317
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,740
It wasn't illegal.

318
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,850
No.

319
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,440
But,uh,that doesn't make it right.

320
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,300
So you think they deserve to die.

321
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,810
No,but it looks like somebody did.

322
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm sensing some anger from you,my dear.

323
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,090
Some anger?

324
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,490
I resent people for being alive.

325
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,370
Including you.

326
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,680
Get out of my house and go do your job.

327
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,850
- hi,I'm with lapd. 
- License and registration.

328
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,320
I'm just headed up to sacramento to conduct interviews
regarding a high-profile murder investigation.

329
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,090
You know how fast you were going?

330
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,180
I was trying to get her up over 100.

331
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,870
I clocked you at 96.

332
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,330
Like I said,an ordinary citizen might
have trouble controlling a vehicle at that speed,

333
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,840
but,uh,as a fellow officer of the law¡ª

334
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,260
you should follow its constructs even more rigorously.

335
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,220
Set an example.

336
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,870
Okay,much as I appreciate your attempt at guidance,

337
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,320
uh,we both know you're not actually gonna write me a ticket.

338
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,830
So,if you'd just hand me back my documents,
go back to bustin' balls,

339
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,250
I'm gonna go ahead and handle my interviews,

340
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,020
see if I can't help solve a real crime,okay,pal?

341
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,580
Okay,pal.

342
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,520
She's right,you're making this personal.

343
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,910
It's affecting the investigation.

344
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,840
What do you know?

345
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,270
Everything you do.

346
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,090
Including that there were four other people
on that plane.

347
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,880
Any of them could've been a target.

348
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,510
Right,so why are you only seeing him?

349
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,770
Damn it,stephen,
didn't you check the valve control before takeoff?

350
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,670
We definitely should've stopped after the fifth martini.

351
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,940
So this is what I getfor being hot?

352
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,850
- I have to be the big shot's assistant. 
- ****So incompetent,

353
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,270
- I mean is it really that hard to fly a plane? 
- Shut up,shut up,shut up.

354
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,330
All right,the ntsb ruled out pilot error,

355
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,290
so unless somebody was trying to kill you guys,

356
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,550
you can't help me.

357
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,150
You worked for billings,
which means he knew as much as you did,if not more.

358
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,450
So you can't help me either.

359
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,360
What about me? I was the one receiving death threats.

360
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,780
I am this investigation.

361
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,910
Okay,fine,you can stay,but you three have gotta go.

362
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,940
Excuse me,why does he get to stay?

363
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,220
'Cause he may still have some important information
about the threats.

364
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
Yeah,but haven't you pretty much
figured out that he doesn't?

365
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,350
Well,how many of the rest of you
were sleeping with my wife?

366
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,410
That's very funny.

367
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,900
H-h-hands down.

368
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,840
so...where we going?

369
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm going to your house,mr.Billings.

370
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,140
who's this guy?

371
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,300
Raines,lapd.

372
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,190
I'm here to speak with angelina billings.

373
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,280
Do you have an appointment?

374
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,600
No,I have a badge.

375
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,100
Hey,this is,uh,detective raines.

376
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,900
He's here to talk about richard.

377
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,010
Imagine a society 
where people just show up at your door.

378
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,210
No phone call,no nothing.

379
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,770
I'll be inside if you need me.

380
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,230
He seems underdressed for a butler.

381
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
And you seem overdressed for a cop.

382
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,230
What can you tell me about the threats
made against your husband's life?

383
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,230
Broken windows,slashed tires,protests.

384
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,510
It wasn't the first time.

385
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,260
Did the two of you discuss them?

386
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,090
Did he hire anybody to investigate?

387
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,170
Are you,uh,purposely ignoring me?

388
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,120
Are you married,detective?

389
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,350
Divorced.

390
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,640
Then you of all people should understand the lack of
communication that sometimes exists within a marriage.

391
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,330
So you didn't discuss them?

392
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,780
He claimed to have hired someone to look into it.

393
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,040
Didn't say who?

394
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,060
For all I know,he was lying to put my mind at ease.

395
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,030
Was that a common occurrence?

396
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
Richard putting my mind at ease?

397
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,260
No.

398
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,710
Lying to you.

399
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,270
How does one keep a happy marriage
without the occasional white lie?

400
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,520
I never lied to my ex.

401
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,890
Maybe you should have.

402
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,870
How would you characterize your marriage,
mrs. Billings?

403
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,660
We both got what we needed.

404
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,010
Do I need to explain further?

405
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,990
I wouldn't be much of a detective if you did.

406
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,170
What do you knowabout planes?

407
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,530
That they crash.

408
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,710
- I don't mean to be presumptive--  
- then don'T.

409
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,080
But you don't appear to feel
too broken up about all this.

410
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,310
I might be if I felt anything at all.

411
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,740
That's,uh,that's healthy.

412
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,240
Right,figments of your imagination 
are floating in her pool,and she's unhealthy.

413
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,180
When you've lost someone you loved,
then you can judge me.

414
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,510
Until then,you'll pardon me
if I tell you to go to hell.

415
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,300
But have a good day.

416
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,310
Yeah,uh,carolyn,it's raines.

417
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Have lance examine the records of all calls 
made to and from angelina billings.

418
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,620
You think she had a part in this?

419
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,730
Right now,I'd say that mrs.Billings
is auditioning for the role of lead suspect.

420
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,550
Also,I'm gonna need the background materials
on the rest of the crash victims.

421
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,370
Oh,carlton hayworth,
the guy who took over billings' company,

422
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,700
is being taken into interrogation.

423
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,050
Detective...

424
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,770
raines.

425
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,820
Carlton hayworth,pleasure.

426
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,830
Now,detective,I realize you have a job to do.

427
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,580
- But if you could keep this brief-- 
- tell me about billings.

428
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,270
Toughest businessman I ever met.

429
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,390
He was my mentor,a real shark.

430
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,200
He had an uncanny knack for playing the right angles.

431
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,550
Though his latest venture had received some opposition.

432
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,740
Well,when you're in the hostile acquisitions game,

433
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,130
you tend to acquire enemies proportionate to your successes.

434
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,500
So from the number of death threats billings had received,

435
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,240
I'll assume you were quite successful.

436
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,920
Death threats?

437
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,770
Please,detective.

438
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,540
If you're not getting death threats
in this line of work,you're the b team.

439
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,530
If this was par for the course,
why had billings hired somebody to investigate?

440
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,950
Do you have to do that?

441
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,760
I don't know.

442
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,120
But he did.

443
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,800
Ex-cop,I believe,joe something,
last name starts with a P.

444
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,800
Joe podalski?

445
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,480
So,hey,I get a phone call saying that
the great michael raines needs podalski's help.

446
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,960
So you bathed in cologne,
and slicked a tub of crisco through your hair,

447
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,810
put on your best suit,and here you are.

448
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,580
Oh,pretty much.

449
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,240
You know,these people in the private sector,
they kind of expect the stereotype.

450
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,560
You know,I look the part,I get more work.

451
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,810
So,what can i do for you,raines-y?

452
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,180
Uh,I'm,uh,looking into the plane crash
that killed richard billings.

453
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,750
Word is he'd hired you to investigate 
death threats that he'd received.

454
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,200
Which is obviously why he's now dead.

455
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,230
Well,you know,I'm not supposed to divulge
that kind of information.

456
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,670
Joe,the guy's dead.

457
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,180
I don't think he'll mind.

458
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,120
Yes,yes,all right.

459
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,300
He did hire me,
but it wasn't about the death threats.

460
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,440
Billings thought there was a mole in his operation

461
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,960
that was leaking information
about his impending land grab.

462
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Really?

463
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,410
What'd you find out? What happened?

464
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,800
Well,billings was killed,I was let go.

465
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,900
How sure was billings of the mole?

466
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,630
Sure enough to hire me.

467
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,740
Where'd you look?

468
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,020
From the outside in.

469
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,860
Whoever organized those protest rallies
had intimate knowledge of the land grab.

470
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,110
And of billings' where abouts on every single day.

471
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,420
If the plane was sabotaged,
you think the mole could've been responsible?

472
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,890
Well,if they found out I was hired,

473
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,200
and they didn't want it coming back to them,sure.

474
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,620
And I've got my people checking protesters now.

475
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,830
Whoever was passionate enough to execute the rallies
might've hated billings enough to kill him.

476
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,640
Well,either way,you've got motive,right?

477
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,290
When you find them,you should have a leg to stand on.

478
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,880
Let me know if you come up with anything,all right?

479
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,930
If I can be of any help,please...

480
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,030
you can take the guy out of the precinct,

481
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,020
but you can't take the precinct out of the guy,huh,joe?

482
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,630
Yeah,something like that.

483
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,300
Oh,and,um,hey...

484
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
sorry to hear about charlie.

485
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,790
That's nice of you to say,thank you.

486
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,030
They were using a political loophole to acquire the land cheap,
move people out, and build a football stadium.

487
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,140
L.A. Could use a football stadium.

488
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,110
This wasn't about football,it was about money.

489
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,870
People with power screwing people without it.

490
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,890
You see,I know I shouldn't have given you this case.

491
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,230
Are you saying this because of what andrew did to the public,

492
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,000
or what he did to your ex...

493
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,710
you calling me unprofessional?

494
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,050
No,I'm calling you a guy,
which is exactly what I was afraid of.

495
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,180
You know,he wasn't such a bad person.

496
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,250
How do you know?

497
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,670
We all went out once.

498
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,750
You bastard.

499
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,490
What?

500
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,370
I feel like I've been cheated on.

501
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,270
You didn't go to bucciano's,did you?

502
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,010
I can't believe this.

503
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,040
You're a friend-whore.

504
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,280
A friend-whore?

505
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,940
What's that even mean?

506
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,590
Hey,you're the friend-whore,you tell me.

507
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,270
Hey,sarah's here.

508
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,360
- Hi. 
- Hi.

509
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,570
I called the station,carolyn told me you were here.

510
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,400
Oh,you know,perfect timing,
I see,'cause I was just gonna...go.

511
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,880
I'll see you at work?

512
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,090
You got the tab?

513
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,550
- Bye. 
- Bye.

514
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,470
How's it going?

515
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,670
Uh,not bad--a few suspects,a couple leads.

516
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,720
I knew it.

517
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,040
But there's no evidence,sarah.

518
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,410
Circumstance and suspects aside,

519
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,270
you need to prepare yourself
that even if this was sabotage,

520
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,020
I came here to-- to apologize.

521
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,460
For earlier.

522
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,320
Past few monthshave been...

523
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,090
I don't sleep,I can't work.

524
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,920
You can't imagine how hard it is
to lose someone like this.

525
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,780
Well,you're not the only person
who's lost somebody,you know.

526
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,220
Oh,god,of course...

527
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,100
charlie.

528
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,550
But you're not only talking about me,
were you,mike?

529
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,660
how's it been,being back at work without him?

530
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,640
Little tough.

531
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,740
Really,michael,I'm sorry.

532
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,120
I know how much he meant to you.

533
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,150
He was the one person that you could confide in.

534
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,480
Wasn't like that.

535
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,970
Charlie just knew better than to ask.

536
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,020
So...

537
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,280
he enabled you?

538
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,460
To be the best damn cop in L.A.

539
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,810
We didn't have to talkabout it.

540
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,250
We were the same,he and I.

541
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,420
Amen,brother.

542
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,750
And don't you forget that.

543
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,640
Really,michael,how are you?

544
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,540
Fine,I suppose.

545
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,120
You seeing anyone?

546
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,420
Go ahead,tell her.

547
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,030
Oh,on occasion.

548
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,240
But nothing too serious?

549
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,210
It,um,varies.

550
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,340
You know,I-I don't know if I'm too comfortable
having this conversation with you.

551
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,560
It's okay,you don't have to talk about it.

552
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,590
Sarah,if I wasn't there for you
as much as I should've been,it's not,

553
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,180
uh,'cause I didn't want to be.

554
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,800
It's okay.

555
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,530
I know.

556
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,870
No,I don't think you do.

557
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,060
I never told you.

558
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,210
To do this job,to find a dead baby in a dumpster,

559
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,470
and know you gotta come back tomorrow
and do the whole thing all over again...

560
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,630
once you let yourself feel anything,

561
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
you can't help but feel everything.

562
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,300
But you do feel it,michael,I know you do.

563
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,360
That's what makes you a great cop.

564
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,360
No,it's controlling those emotions
that makes me a great cop.

565
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,240
But a lousy husband.

566
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,640
I should go.

567
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,650
No,no,no,you can stay.

568
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,660
Here,here,have,uh,have a drink.

569
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,560
Thanks,but I...

570
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,460
I'm really exhausted.

571
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,230
You let me know if you find anything?

572
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,190
Good night,michael.

573
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,060
Tough to watch her leave,isn't it?

574
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,600
Every time.

575
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,890
My god,this mattress is awful.

576
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,170
How do you get any reston this thing?

577
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,100
It's the same one he had when he was married.

578
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,400
He just can't bring himself to get rid of it.

579
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,390
so who is he?

580
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,450
rodrigo quinero.

581
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,270
Arrested twice in connection with these protests.

582
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,010
Plead guilty for failure to disperse.

583
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,200
Unsuccessfully tried for criminal conspiracy.

584
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,160
He was handing out baseball bats to protesters.

585
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,800
Look at this.

586
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,760
Wrong place,wrong time.

587
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,880
Looks like an angry guy.

588
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,720
I'd love to meet him.

589
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,520
I thought you might.

590
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,070
We tracked him down where he's working,
but he's refusing to come in.

591
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,180
Says we can go down there,
we wanna talk to him so badly.

592
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,160
Where's he work?

593
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,730
Rodrigo quinero? I'm detective raines,lapd. 
Got a minute?

594
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
For what?

595
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,370
Your swing needs work,see,
you're dropping your shoulder.

596
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,830
you came out here to tell me that?

597
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,990
I came out here because that picture
was taken at the santa monica airport.

598
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,480
They already arrested me for this.

599
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,020
That was before billings's plane was sabotaged.

600
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,750
Sabotaged?

601
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,570
How are you getting your information?

602
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,100
I can put you at the scene 
of the crime wielding a baseball bat.

603
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,650
You knew when he flew,the jet he flew in,
and this doesn't get better

604
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,910
until you tell me what I want to know.

605
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,620
- I didn't touch his plane. 
- Maybe not,

606
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,500
but the kind of guy
who hands out weapons to protesters 

607
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,590
wouldn't mind recruiting somebody else to.

608
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,640
You wanna charge me,go ahead.

609
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,380
Otherwise,I got work to do.

610
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,130
I know about your family,rodrigo.

611
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Chavez ravine,1959.

612
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,720
You watched your parents forcefully evicted
from their home,handcuffed,dragged away.

613
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,640
And it didn't stop there,did it?

614
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,630
My parents were immigrants.

615
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,440
After they arrested them,
they deported them.

616
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,430
But you were born here,
so you were allowed to stay.

617
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,570
Yes.

618
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,310
You were,what,five years old?

619
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,320
And I'll bet you still remember what it felt like.

620
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,810
50 years of anger.

621
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,590
Chip on your shoulder the size of dodger stadium.

622
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,450
No wonder you were distributing baseball bats.

623
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,860
Look,I'm trying to keep good people from losing their homes.

624
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,270
What do you want from me,detective?

625
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,230
I know that somebody in billings's camp
was leaking you information-- I need a name.

626
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,140
I have enough here to book you.

627
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,790
The man you were harassing is dead.

628
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,120
Unless you point me in another direction,

629
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,490
I'm gonna use my considerable energies to amass a case 

630
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,970
to prove that you sabotaged that plane.

631
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,890
Fine.

632
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,270
Enjoy prison.

633
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,670
Lots of good your efforts will do anybody from there.

634
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,920
He provided the logistics. I informed the press.

635
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,390
Organized the rallies.

636
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,900
His name,rodrigo.

637
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,660
You better have a really good reason
for bringing me down here again,detective.

638
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,600
I do,actually,mr.Hayworth.

639
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,080
Rodrigo asked me to say hi.

640
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,810
So let's try this again.

641
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,710
This time save the "he was a mentor" crap
for somebody who cares.

642
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,150
You wanted him out,didn't you?

643
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,010
Corporate america is about survival of the fittest.

644
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,440
Billings was out of shape.

645
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,280
You back-stabbing little bastard.

646
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,250
You wanted his job.

647
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,450
If the land deal faltered,
you'd have reason to get him out.

648
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,500
It's just business.

649
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,830
Billings knew about the leak.

650
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,520
He just wasn't sure of the source.

651
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,130
That's why he hired podalski.

652
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,270
You panicked,afraid he'd trace it back to you.

653
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,880
So you paid somebody to sabotage billings's plane.

654
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,700
You fired podalski before he found anything.

655
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,480
That's just not true.

656
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,200
He's lying.

657
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,170
I've subpoenaed the mechanic's financial records
along with yours.

658
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,800
I'm betting one of them had money coming in.

659
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,460
Won't be difficult to link their deposits
to your withdrawals.

660
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,510
I want my attorney.

661
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,440
Hello?

662
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,090
Uh,is this,uh,foghat?

663
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,950
Oh,yeah,sorry about that.

664
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,130
- Hey. 
- Did you find anything in sacramento?

665
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,590
The plane was only there a few hours.

666
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,240
The mechanics had no interaction with it.

667
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
It was pre-fueled for the entire trip.

668
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,990
And there were no maintenance logs.

669
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,930
Hello?

670
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,940
Raines?

671
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,760
how'd I do this time?

672
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,890
104,congratulations.

673
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,850
How'd the interviews go?

674
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,570
Dead ends.

675
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,350
Mm,that's a shame.

676
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,780
Whole trip for nothing.

677
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,380
Hayworth's lawyer just showed up.

678
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,550
Uh...did you offer him a beverage?

679
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,440
Unless you've got something,michael,
he's gonna walk.

680
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,210
I know,I need to make a connection to a mechanic.

681
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,130
Give me five more minutes.

682
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,490
In five minutes,he's gonna own you,me,and the station.

683
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,390
Let's go.

684
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,890
- You let him go,he'll be on a jet--  
- and extradition's a bitch.

685
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,690
Five minutes.

686
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,550
Two,tops.

687
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,290
Lance!

688
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,220
How much do you love me?

689
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,080
Did you find something to link
hayworth to one of the mechanics?

690
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,010
No.

691
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,470
Then...not so much.

692
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,060
I found a different link to a mechanic.

693
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,990
Remember how you asked me to look into
angelina billings' phone records?

694
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,840
Well,she received a number of phone calls
in the months before,around,after the accident,

695
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,850
all belonging to the same mobile number.

696
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
Belonging to craig fuhlman.

697
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,980
Fuhlman is head of operations for the company
that handles billings's plane.

698
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,190
He could've been calling to schedule maintenance,
deal with invoices¡ª

699
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,630
he also sent flowers to the billings address
not long after the crash.

700
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,960
He'd know billings for 15 years.

701
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,170
I'll bet hayworth sent flowers.

702
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,370
Hey,we probably sent something.

703
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,450
Possibly,but by then I was curious,
so I did some poking around into fuhlman.

704
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,450
This is a flight manifest for a trip he took to
cabo san lucas two months before the crash.

705
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,970
Hayworth isn't on it,neither are we.

706
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,510
But guess who is.

707
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,940
You love me. I know.

708
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,780
Angelina billings...

709
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,520
the grieving widow by the pool.

710
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,770
Sorry to drag you away from your pool,mrs.Billings.

711
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,980
Tell me about the affair.

712
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,970
- I don't know what you're--  
- talking about?

713
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,820
This is the manifest for a flight six months ago
from lax to cabo san lucas.

714
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,850
Here you are,3a.

715
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,080
Here's craig fuhlman,3b.

716
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,270
Now,tell me about the affair.

717
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,730
Unbelievable,she was doing the mechanic.

718
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,840
Richard was a very powerful man.

719
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,750
He felt the need to stray.

720
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,760
We talked about it,came to an arrangement.

721
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,350
I used craig to get back at richard.

722
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm sure that's how it started.

723
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,760
But then maybe you developed feelings for craig?

724
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,080
- Decided you'd be happier with him. 
- No.

725
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,300
I know that you signed a prenup.

726
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,640
Divorce richard,you get nothing.

727
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
But if he's killed?

728
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,390
Are you accusing me of killing my own husband?

729
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,280
This is motive.

730
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,100
And we know that craig had the opportunity.

731
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,490
You could've just left richard,

732
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,720
but there was no way that you'd be happy
living on a mechanic's salary.

733
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,420
Just like sarah couldn't live on a cop'S.

734
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,150
How long were you seeing him?

735
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,230
Only a few months. And then I broke it off.

736
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,190
Why?

737
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,700
I thought it would make me feel better
about richard's indiscretions.

738
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,420
It didn'T.

739
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,860
Have you talked to him since the crash?

740
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,910
He called.

741
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,820
I never responded.

742
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,070
Was craig in love with you?

743
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,200
Probably.

744
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,570
Yes.

745
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,500
Do you think craig might have done this?

746
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,260
I still think you might have done this.

747
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,680
I know my marriage wasn't perfect,detective.

748
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,780
No,no,no,no,a no-hitter isn't perfect,
but at least it's close.

749
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,630
Your marriage was a disaster.

750
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,010
- Once richard found out about the affair--  
- wait a minute,

751
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,740
he knew that you were sleeping with fuhlman?

752
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,450
He didn't know who,he just knew I was.

753
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,580
But it changed things,I don't know why.

754
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,820
Richard stopped sleeping around.

755
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,570
We were working things out.

756
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,650
There was love between us.

757
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,130
Right,and now you're so distraught 
with his death that three months later,

758
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,070
you're already seeing somebody else.

759
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,030
What?

760
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,870
You expect me to believe that that guy
at your house was what,uh,the pool boy?

761
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,460
No,detective,but I do expect you
to believe that he's my brother.

762
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,250
She busted you pretty good.

763
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,640
Oh,I'm so glad that you were here to see
that and that you felt the need to bring it up.

764
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,680
You never ask a question...

765
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,480
that you don't know the answer to.

766
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,810
Now why don't we talk about something else?

767
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,260
Okay. You think she's lying?

768
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,650
Of course she is.

769
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,570
I don't know.

770
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,350
Maybe she's not such a bad actress.

771
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,080
I heard she was pretty good
on that show paradise island.

772
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,220
Call me if I can help.

773
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,920
Angie!

774
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,240
We need to talk.

775
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,790
It's good to see you.

776
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,540
You need to stop trying to contact me.

777
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,310
The police have been asking questions about richard.

778
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,620
They think I have something to do with his death.

779
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,830
But that's crazy.

780
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:26,920
You know that,and I know that.

781
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,670
But they don't know that.

782
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,520
They think we're in on this together.

783
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,880
They don't realize that
what we had was just a fling.

784
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:33,900
but it wasn'T.

785
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,780
of course it was,you never really loved me.

786
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,620
yes,it was.

787
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,710
You don't love me,craig.

788
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,010
You're young,inexperienced.

789
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,350
You don't even know what real love is.

790
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,640
you're just inexperienced.

791
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,400
You don't know what real love is.

792
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,210
What that feels like.

793
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,610
How can you say that?

794
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,790
We had some fun,but that's all it was.

795
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,610
We had fun.

796
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,380
You were never gonna be the person 
that I'd spend the rest of my life with.

797
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,830
You're not the man 
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

798
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,030
You weren't good enough for me.

799
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,130
Don't do this to yourself.

800
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,810
you couldn't have kept me happy.

801
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,260
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

802
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,660
just let it go,move on.

803
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,030
You and I'll never be anything again.

804
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,940
And there's nothing you can say to change that.

805
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,570
That's it,man,let it go,just move on.

806
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,370
there's nothing you can say to change that.

807
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,570
I killed him,ange.

808
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,980
the plane crash...

809
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,130
I engineered it.

810
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,730
That's why I wanted to see you.

811
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,730
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

812
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,440
Weeks before the crash,
I replaced the baggage floor panel.

813
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,560
I layered it with sulfuric acid.

814
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,300
That's what blew out.

815
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,140
That's why the plane crashed.

816
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,440
I did it for you.

817
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,530
For us.

818
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,100
So we could be together.

819
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,390
Son of a bitch.

820
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,960
- I had to have you. 
- You killed my husband?

821
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,690
But I'm in love with you.

822
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,530
Angie!

823
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,780
That's it,that's it.

824
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,430
you don't understand.

825
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,050
She was the most beautiful woman
that I've ever seen.

826
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,760
The thought of her being with anyone else
drove me crazy.

827
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,760
And he didn't even appreciate her.

828
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,830
Richard didn't deserve her.

829
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,190
Richard billings may not have been the greatest guy
to ever walk the face of the earth,

830
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,090
but he certainly didn't deserve to die
for his indiscretions.

831
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,490
Well,I guess that's about as good as I'll get.

832
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,570
well,I watched him.

833
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,130
Every week a different girl.

834
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,940
Flying them to hawaii,mexico.

835
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,310
Lying to angie.

836
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,630
Craig,you killed four completely innocent people.

837
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,900
I know.

838
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,630
Including jamison wallace.

839
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,290
He was the pilot.

840
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,020
He lived in orange county with his wife of 33 years.

841
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,080
He had a 12-foot sailboat.

842
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,970
Two years ago,his oldest son gave him a grandchild.

843
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,500
He was a grandfather for the very...

844
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,100
very first time.

845
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,320
Stephen arnette was the copilot.

846
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,660
He'd only gotten his pilot's license a few years ago.

847
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,260
He spent eight years driving trucks.

848
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,420
That's how he earned the money for flying lessons.

849
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,740
Billings' assistant kara had just graduated from ucla.

850
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,880
She lived in westwood with her three best friends.

851
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,850
She'd lost her parents when she was very young.

852
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,080
Her friends were all she had.

853
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,380
They took up a collection to pay for her funeral.

854
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,410
They managed to get more than enough.

855
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,480
She was very much loved.

856
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,010
And the fourth was andrew carver.

857
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,280
He was successful,well-liked,caring.

858
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,700
And recently married.

859
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,750
He lived with his wife in a beautiful home.

860
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,730
They were getting ready to start a family.

861
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,500
Hey.

862
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,340
Congratulations on grabbing fuhlman.

863
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,450
That's why you put me on the case,right?

864
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,360
You tell sarah yet?

865
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,210
No.

866
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,880
Well,she should be pleased.

867
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,210
I imagine she will.

868
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,820
You okay?

869
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,930
Yeah,fine.

870
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,560
Liar.

871
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,150
Friend-whore.

872
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,380
Good night,michael.

873
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,230
Good night,daniel.

874
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,370
Rough deal,you getting killed because of billings.

875
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,950
I didn't have to work for him.

876
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,700
Maybe that's what I get.

877
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,960
Karma.

878
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,450
You were doing your job.

879
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,950
It's not your fault.

880
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,960
You don't have to be the nice guy.

881
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,900
It's natural to have animosity towards me.

882
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,080
I understand.

883
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,090
It's not about who you were.

884
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,780
It's about you you were with.

885
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,170
Which makes it my problem,not yours.

886
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,510
Well,that's very gracious of you.

887
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,330
I suppose.

888
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,530
Though the fact that 
I'm complimenting myself does cheapen it a bit.

889
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,480
They aren't true,you know.

890
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,630
Those things that you said at the surveillance van.

891
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,400
It isn't that you weren't good enough for her.

892
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,320
What difference does it make?

893
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,290
I'm divorced,you're dead.

894
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,380
And that's the way it is.

895
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,100
Because it's important
that you understand why I'm here.

896
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,420
Well,I am growing a bit confused,
considering I solved the case.

897
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,330
What case?

898
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,580
The plane crash?

899
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,960
Yeah,of course,the plane...

900
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,240
you appeared before any of the others.

901
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,980
You're still here now.

902
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,860
This whole thing,
it wasn't about sarah needing closure,was it?

903
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,860
No,michael.

904
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,450
She still loves you,you know.

905
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,670
Always will.

906
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,250
Yeah,just not the way she loved you.

907
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,780
It doesn't help,does it?

908
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,490
Knowing what happened,having a reason.

909
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,120
I thought it might,but...

910
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,580
I'm sorry,sarah.

911
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,570
I know how difficult this is.

912
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,900
It's not the same as losing charlie,michael.

913
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,730
No,it's not.

914
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,960
Michael?

915
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,070
I know what you're looking for.

916
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,070
Some sort of closure.

917
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,710
Something to ease your pain.

918
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,190
But closure doesn't exist.

919
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,430
You're gonna feel this in some form or another forever 

920
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,220
because that's how it feels...

921
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,750
when you lose the love of your life.

922
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,340
And even if you could wake up tomorrow 
and not feel this pain,

923
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,470
you wouldn't really want that either.

924
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:25,800
Because that hurt is the most sure reminder you
have of what he truly meant to you.

925
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,330
And that,you won't ever want to forget.
