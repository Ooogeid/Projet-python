1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:01,899
sleep...

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,199
you know.What could be more natural?

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,899
You close your eyes,

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,100
and the next thing you know,it's morning,right?

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,399
Unless you start thinking about things.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,899
Like how your marriage might've been
saved if you'd worked a little harder,

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,800
or how your partner might still be
alive if you'd fired a little sooner.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,599
So maybe you'll watch the tv to drown out the noise in your head.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,899
good little boy,yeah.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,999
But if you don't grab...

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,299
trouble is sometimes that's worse.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,799
Then mr.Bear is going to eat your lunch!

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,699
After a while,you get kind of used to
living in a state of weariness.

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,899
It may be physical,but it starts to feel...

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,299
existential.

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,799
And then it's the morning.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,699
And,ready or not,you--

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
you gotta start all over again.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,599
Raines.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,500
It's a simple thing,sleep.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,499
But without it,

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,200
you start to lose your ability
to concentrate or perform simple tasks.

23
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,099
And,uh,after a while,

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,999
you could even start to hallucinate.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,800
They say if you go without sleep long enough,you'll die.

26
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,299
But I see death every day,and sometimes,

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,900
it looks restful.

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,100
Like a big sleep.

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey,maybe raymond chandler was an insomniac.

30
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,099
Homeowner called it in.Our victim's a jane doe.

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,399
Approximately 40 years old.

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,499
Looked like she died in her sleep,

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,299
until one of the the uniforms found this.

34
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,199
Bullet hole?

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Small caliber,no exit wound.

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,799
And that's it?Single gunshot to the chest?

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,399
Yeah.No identification,

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,099
no signs of sexual assault,

39
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,099
no shell casings,

40
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,199
and so far,no witnesses.

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,599
Looks like she passed out here and
somebody just walked up and shot her.

42
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,399
Okay,run her prints.

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,599
See if she's in the system.

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,300
We'll regroup at the station.

45
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,799
I got a james milton over here,

46
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,399
wants to talk to the detective in charge.

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Where abouts?

48
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,099
Detective raines,mr.Milton.

49
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,799
What can I do for you?

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,599
Yeah,I've got contractors who need to get into this alley to work.

51
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,699
Are we're tying it up with our homicide investigation.

52
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,999
Million five to buy in this neighborhood.

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,599
Look who i've got for neighbors.

54
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,299
The homeless?

55
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,599
I pay through the nose for ocean view and clean air.

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,699
They get same thing for free.

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,499
Yeah,talk about working the system,huh?

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,999
Nice shoes.Armani?

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,599
That's right.

60
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,599
Have you worn those here today?

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,399
Yeah,why?

62
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,399
Uh,stand right here.

63
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,499
I'm gonna get a tech to come over and do plaster casts.

64
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,499
What?Are you crazy?

65
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,499
We gotta distinguish your footprints from the killer'S.

66
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,999
These are $400 shoes.

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,799
Yeah,it's gonna be messy.

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,699
But a human life has been taken.

69
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,200
And every life has value,right,mr.Milton?

70
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,900
Hey,mister!

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,700
You're not gonna throw that out,are you?

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,399
Look at all these people.

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,999
Never got this kind of attention when I was alive,

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,899
I'll tell you that.

75
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,000
Slow down,talk to me!

76
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,699
Or you want me to wash your windshields?

77
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,199
I gotta go find your killer.

78
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,799
Fat lot of good that'll do.

79
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,100
Know when I could've really have used a cop?

80
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,900
Last night!

81
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,199
Tell me.

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,399
Preliminary canvass of the
neighborhood turned up some people

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,699
who'd seen her going through their trash,

84
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,799
but they didn't know who she was.

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,899
Did we get a uh...

86
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,199
hit on the victim's prints?

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,999
She's not in the system.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,900
Well,of course I'm not in the system.

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,599
the coroner find anything in her pockets?

90
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,599
One half candy bar,

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,199
two packages of saltine crackers,

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,099
one plastic fork,

93
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,299
and 78 cents in change.

94
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,600
Just ignore me,everybody does.

95
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
You okay?

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,399
Yeah,a little tired.

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,399
What about her shopping bags?

98
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,499
Same as in her pocket--boyer's putting them in evidence.

99
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,599
We did get her tox screen.

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,599
Any surprises?

101
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,799
Blood alcohol level: 0.18.

102
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,799
That's not a surprise.

103
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,599
Listen,did you just say 0.18?

104
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,399
Yeah,why?

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,499
I got a bet with a uniform.

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,999
About her blood alcohol level?

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
Yeah,I just won ten bucks.

108
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,699
What is that,uh--

109
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,999
hand lotion you got there?

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,399
That's hand sanitizer.

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,000
I'd rather take a shower.

112
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,799
You just don't know where that stuff has been.

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,399
right,well,here's what we do know.

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,100
That a person or persons unknown shot a sleeping bag lady.

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,599
Uh,the victim's not in the system.

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,199
That doesn't mean she fell out of the sky either.

117
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,399
Somebody's gotta know her.

118
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,599
You two canvass homeless camps and local businesses.

119
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,300
I'm gonna cover the shelters and outreach centers.

120
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,300
This is for everybody?

121
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,999
Unless it's got a name on them.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,699
All this is here anytime you want it?

123
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,599
Pretty much.

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,100
Sweet!

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah.

126
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Boyer.

127
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,899
It's yours.

128
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah!

129
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,899
Gentlemen.

130
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,599
Can I trouble you?

131
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,299
Do--do you know this lady by any chance?

132
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,999
come on,you guys.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,299
You can't hang out on the sidewalk.

134
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,100
If you wanna come in,come in.

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,100
Detective raines?

136
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,799
Yeah,that's right.

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,999
Helen mullen.

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,900
Maya over at salvation army told
me that you were making the rounds.

139
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,900
Let's go inside,get away from the jackhammers.

140
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,099
It's okay,nemo,he's a friend.

141
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay?

142
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,499
listen to him.

143
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,200
He's protective,isn't he?

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,399
Virile.

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,199
Help yourself to some coffee,detective.

146
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,799
Oh,is it--is it leaded or unleaded?

147
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,300
It is premium.

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,199
That's--now you're--

149
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,300
now you're talking my language.

150
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,799
Ooh,what is this?

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,900
Look at that.

152
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,900
Big shot there.

153
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,699
And another big shot here.

154
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,699
Back in the day,homelessness was a sexy issue.

155
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,899
Come thanksgiving,we'd be fighting them off with a stick.

156
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,499
The homeless?

157
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,699
The celebrities,the politicos.

158
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,999
They wanted to show their compassion by feeding
thanksgiving dinner to those less fortunate.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,099
Of course,we needed help the other 364 days too,

160
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,399
but there weren't any cameras then.

161
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,399
Yeah.

162
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Take a look at this,uh...

163
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,400
do you recognize that...that lady?

164
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,899
She's,um...

165
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,299
she's been around,but it's been awhile.

166
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,399
I never knew her name.

167
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,600
What do you remember about her?

168
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
You know,she used to,um...

169
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,099
she used to sometimes partner with a--

170
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,400
a street person named mickey russo.

171
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,299
What can you tell me about mickey russo?

172
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,899
Just that he's violent when he's drunk.

173
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,500
And he's always drunk.

174
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,799
It was a pretty volatile relationship.

175
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,900
Okay.

176
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,999
have any idea where I can find mr.Mickey russo?

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,699
None,I-- like I said,

178
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,499
it's-- it's been awhile.

179
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,199
boyer.

180
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,499
Yeah,I need you to start looking for a,gentleman named mickey russo.

181
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,899
He used to partner with our vic.

182
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,699
had a history of violence,

183
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,899
-sir!
-Especially when he was drinking.

184
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,599
Yeah,finding him would be a priority.

185
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,999
The picture-- is there a reward?

186
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,699
Uh,maybe so.

187
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,999
There's a motel on,uh,lincoln.

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,299
The sign looks like a mexican sombrero.

189
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,999
I used to see her there.

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,699
Well,what's the reward?

191
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,299
You gotta be kidding.

192
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,899
That's it?

193
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,299
That's all I got,but I'm really good with faces.

194
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,100
It was her,I swear.

195
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,499
Bless you.

196
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,600
Bless you.

197
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,199
yeah,she worked here.

198
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,899
Name's alice brody.

199
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,299
How long ago,may I ask?

200
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,599
Maybe two years.

201
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,299
Owner gave her a job cleaning the rooms.

202
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,899
I told him,

203
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,499
"hey,you can pick up "a mexican girl for
the same money and they work twice as hard."

204
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,900
But she told him some hard luck story.

205
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
They all have a hard luck story.

206
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,399
Then she doesn't show up for work three days in a row,

207
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,099
and came back like nothing had happened.

208
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,599
I threw her out.

209
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,499
Told her alice doesn't work here anymore.

210
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,800
Why you didn't like her?

211
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,999
You take people's money,

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,800
you should play by their rules,right?

213
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,099
You have any,

214
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,999
uh,employment records on her still?

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,399
Like a w-4 or something?

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,399
I doubt it.

217
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,900
You mind taking a little look?

218
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah.

219
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,600
There you go.

220
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you.

221
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,300
bonjour,monsieur raines.

222
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,799
What?

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,099
You heard the word "maid,"

224
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,999
and your sweaty little imagination went wild.

225
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,099
And what's big hair's problem,anyway?

226
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,299
What,you don't think,uh...

227
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,499
disappearing on a three-day
bender is grounds for dismissal?

228
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,499
Well,maybe I couldn't face coming back to work.

229
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,699
You see that sign out front?

230
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,899
"Siesta rates"?

231
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,499
Guess who had to change the sheets between siestas.

232
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,399
Really?They-- they change the sheets?

233
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,199
I'm just saying,it'd drive anybody to drink.

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,299
you got lucky.

235
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,899
Tell me.

236
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,399
Don't ask me why,but we still have her job application.

237
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,399
Now,there we go.

238
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,699
Who wrote this note at the bottom?

239
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,900
The owner.

240
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,099
"Friend of sal."

241
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,599
Sal martinez.

242
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Has an auto body shop down lincoln.

243
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Guess he recommended her.

244
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,599
I think she used to work checkout in a parts store.

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,500
Maybe.

246
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,999
Well,how well did you know her?

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,999
Just to say hi.

248
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,899
We need that.

249
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,599
But you recommended her for a job?

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,799
I don't remember.

251
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,899
Well,wait a minute.

252
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,399
Here's your name and phone
number on her job application.

253
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,899
Okay,I did.

254
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,499
Oh,you did?

255
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,600
My wife.

256
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,100
She does the books.

257
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,900
I see,um...

258
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,999
okay,thanks,okay.

259
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,099
Sal,take a little walk with me to my car.

260
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,300
Just for a second.

261
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,299
You know,a couple of years and a few more teeth ago,

262
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,699
I'll bet,

263
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,899
uh,our alice was not a half-bad- looking lady.

264
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,899
Okay,what do you mean?

265
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
I mean,you're a crummy liar.

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,199
You got it all wrong.

267
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,799
Tell me.

268
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,499
Okay,look.

269
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,499
I used to see alice at the parts store.

270
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,499
I heard she could be,you know,

271
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,299
friendly when she had a few drinks in her.

272
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,799
Later,when she was living in her car,

273
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,599
she used to come around,and hit me up for money.

274
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,700
That's when I put her onto that job at the motel.

275
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,199
Thank you very much.

276
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
Come in and I'll take care of you.

277
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,100
When was the last time you saw her?

278
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,799
About a week ago.

279
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,900
She looked bad.

280
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,599
Said she wanted to get off the street.

281
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,999
Asked me to drive her to social security to apply for ssi.

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,299
What happened?

283
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,399
they said she wasn't eligible.

284
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Said that she had money in a bank account.

285
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,699
Did they say what bank?

286
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,200
I think it was california national.

287
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,999
"a couple of years and a few teeth ago?"

288
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,299
I was trying to make a point.

289
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,899
Uh,nice--nice boyfriends,by the way.

290
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,299
Mickey russo and captain side action back there?

291
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,199
What were you-- what were you doing?

292
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,499
Working out some self-esteem issues?

293
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,299
You don't have to be insulting.

294
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,399
Speaking of insulting,what do you got me wearing now?

295
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,499
Sal said you worked in a parts store.

296
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,399
Fine,

297
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,499
I'd like to see what you'd look
like after a few years on the street.

298
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,699
If we keep talking like this,

299
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,599
you're gonna get your wish.

300
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,899
yeah,a week ago,last friday,

301
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,099
your bag lady came into the branch,drunk.

302
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,999
Said her name was alice brody.

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,699
Thank you.

304
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600
And that she wanted her money.

305
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,199
Gave us a social security number,

306
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,500
which belongs to a-- a client named alice brody.

307
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,399
And this isn't your client alice brody?

308
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,099
She was a bag lady,detective.

309
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,999
Fine,well,she could be an eccentric heiress--

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,199
she didn't know the password,the pin number.

311
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,099
This--this was not her account.

312
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,799
Okay.

313
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,199
how'd she come by the information then?

314
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,499
Dumpster diving.

315
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,599
You know,vagrants find financial records and run scams.

316
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,499
It's low-tech identity theft.

317
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,599
I--I got you.

318
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,499
So what about your client,the real alice brody?

319
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,099
Tell me about her.

320
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,299
I left a couple messages on her voice mail.

321
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,499
I'm still waiting to hear back.

322
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,299
Really?

323
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,799
If somebody were trying to get into my bank account,

324
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,200
I'd want details,wouldn't you?

325
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,699
you know,I can't explain why people do what they do.

326
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,199
Oh,boy,that's my whole job--

327
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,099
trying to explain why people do what they do.

328
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,299
Well,does anybody here know your alice brody?

329
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,600
I don't think--

330
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
wait.

331
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,700
Hang on.

332
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,100
Oh,you got a notion.

333
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,599
Scott bills,that's funny.

334
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,699
You work in a bank,and your name is bills.

335
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,199
No,no,she-- she does all her banking online.

336
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,599
What do you mean?She's never set foot inside this branch?

337
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,700
Nope.

338
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,899
hey,do me a favor.

339
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
Get her on the phone,would you?

340
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,799
Sure.

341
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,499
So nobody mentions that?

342
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,899
That scott bills--?

343
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,499
I had an archery teacher whose name was mrs.Bowman.

344
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,199
There was a--

345
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,099
I knew somebody who worked at a-- at a ,
greek restaurant named harry "pair-o-testes."

346
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,199
There's a whole of things like that,I think.

347
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,899
You know,there's a guy at a--

348
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,999
What,is it disconnected?

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,599
Yeah,it is.

350
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,099
Okay,um...

351
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,499
I am gonna need that address.

352
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,599
so I'm a dumpster-diving con artist,huh?

353
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,799
Occam's razor.

354
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,899
The simplest solution is usually the right one.

355
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,399
But sal said I heard about this bank
account at the social security office.

356
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,799
So why would I need to go dumpster diving?

357
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,499
Occam's razor,right?

358
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,600
Yeah,well...

359
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,599
I'm gonna talk to the bank's alice brody
before I really make up my mind.

360
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,399
Oh,your mind was made up a long time ago.

361
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,899
I'm homeless,so you don't have to give
me the benefit of the doubt.

362
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,999
I make a scene in a bank,

363
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,900
so I must be trying to rip somebody off.

364
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,800
That's a reasonable assumption.

365
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,500
Well,I'd like to see you make an
unreasonable assumption for once.

366
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,600
Come on!

367
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,499
If it wasn't on the tip of your tongue,

368
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,100
I wouldn't even be here.

369
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,900
Maybe you didn't steal her identity.

370
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Maybe she stole yours.

371
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,499
alice brody?

372
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,700
Lapd.

373
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,700
Go!

374
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,700
Clear!

375
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Don't be shy,come on in.

376
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,199
what is it,detective?

377
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Dripping tap.

378
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,900
All clear.

379
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,300
Uh,okay.

380
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,999
I'll take it from here.

381
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,300
I'll take it from here.

382
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,399
Thanks--thanks,guys.

383
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,899
Post that copy of the warrant on the
--on the door,if you will.

384
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,400
Thank you.

385
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,200
Good work.

386
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Yeah.

387
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,000
That better be a local call,mister.

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,799
The line's dead.

389
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,099
So this is my place.

390
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,199
And it doesn't look like much yet,

391
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,099
but I had high hopes for it.

392
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,700
You weren't living here,alice.

393
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,499
Somebody was renting this place in your name.

394
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,900
Why would somebody do that?

395
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,400
Uh,let me see.

396
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,700
Mail.

397
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,999
Oh,it's-- it's mostly junk,huh?

398
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,999
Oh,that's appropriate.

399
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,100
Don't you think?

400
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,099
Oh,I saw a little thought get in there.

401
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,099
You're thinking I clean up pretty good.

402
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,400
You're thinking you might wanna see me
back in that french maid outfit again?

403
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
No.

404
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,000
Here.

405
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,600
Yeah,somethinlike that.

406
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,700
Okay.

407
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,100
Now,what is all this?

408
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,700
What?

409
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,199
"To valued portfolio account customer."

410
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,600
Alice brody.

411
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,599
"Portfolio customer."

412
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Shareholder.

413
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,400
Investor?

414
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,599
" What were you doing,playing the stock market?

415
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,700
How do you think I got where I am today?

416
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,699
carolyn?

417
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,500
Yeah,.

418
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,300
we need a,a warrant for a,uh,stock market portfolio account

419
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,600
under the name of alice brody.

420
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,099
No,I'm not kidding.

421
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,599
Yeah,I know she's homeless.

422
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,800
I--it doesn't make sense to me either.

423
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,999
give it to lance.

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,499
And see how boyer's,
coming along with tracking down mickey russo.

425
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,400
And,um...

426
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,599
I'll be back in a couple hours.

427
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,299
Thanks.

428
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,500
Why do you feel you have to like your victims?

429
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,100
It's better if I don't dislike them.

430
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,899
What about alice do you dislike?

431
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,200
She's annoying.

432
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,099
She's dead.

433
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,099
The way I imagine her,she's annoying.

434
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,900
Yeah?

435
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,900
Ah,here.

436
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Imagine her sitting in that stool.

437
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,900
Indulge me.

438
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,100
Can you imagine her there?

439
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,599
no.

440
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,800
Liar.

441
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,899
You say talking to the victim is part of your process.

442
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,799
Okay,show me your process.

443
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,100
Talk to the victim.

444
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,300
What happened to you?

445
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,099
How'd you get like this?

446
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,099
Picking in dumpsters.

447
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,099
Living on the street.

448
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,599
It's,uh,disgusting.

449
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,100
It's annoying.

450
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,699
You know?

451
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,700
I-I know that,uh,times can be tough.

452
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,699
Bad things happen.

453
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,499
You kind of wanna escape.

454
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,099
You have mental challenges,mental quirks.

455
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,999
Wanna go a little crazy?

456
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,299
Hey,join the club!

457
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,099
Who doesn't?

458
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,499
But what,it's not your fault?

459
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,699
It's not my responsibility?

460
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,399
It's unavoidable?

461
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,999
Next thing you're gonna tell me it's a--it's a disease.

462
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,299
Everything's a disease!

463
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,299
Everything's a disease!

464
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,299
I can't stop eating.

465
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,499
I can't stop thinking.

466
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,199
Is there no such thing as self-control?

467
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,700
Is there no willpower?!

468
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,800
Don't put your so-called problems on display.

469
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,899
Have some dignity.

470
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Cut it out!

471
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,700
What does she say?

472
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,600
She stuck her tongue out at me.

473
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,300
You asked.

474
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,599
You know,the difficult thing about dealing
with homeless people and crazy people,

475
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,500
is that they represent the qualities in
all of us that we fear the most.

476
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,600
where is lance?

477
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,499
She took off a couple hours ago.

478
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,299
She was having trouble with the warrant
for that stock market account.

479
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,800
She said she was gonna try a different approach.

480
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,299
Oh,baby.

481
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,599
D-d-don't start with me,all right?

482
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,699
I've talked to every wino from here to ocean park,

483
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,399
looking for that mickey russo guy.

484
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,900
And?

485
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,899
And his old drinking buddies haven't seen him.

486
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,399
They figure he's probably dead.

487
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,699
Which,normally,would've been good enough for me.

488
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,999
But not this time.

489
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,099
How'd you find him?

490
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,199
I looked in the phone book.

491
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,599
Turns out he's listed.

492
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,000
I imagine the hand sanitizer you
could've saved by starting there.

493
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,900
Mr.Russo?

494
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,499
I'm sure that uh,

495
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,099
detective boyer told
you why--

496
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,099
why we wanted to see you.

497
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,499
Someone killed alice.

498
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,499
You know who did it?

499
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,600
Not yet.

500
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,199
But uh,we were hoping that you'd-- you'd,uh...

501
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
have some ideas about that.

502
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,300
You wanna know if it was me.

503
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,999
Because I used to beat on her.

504
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,200
I appreciate a man who gets to the nub.

505
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,000
Did you kill her?

506
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
No,sir.

507
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,300
I loved her.

508
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,299
A lot of blood's been spilled in the
name of--

509
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,799
in the name of love,mr.Russo.

510
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,499
That's true enough,but I didn't do it.

511
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,599
When was the last time you saw her?

512
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,799
Six,eight weeks ago.

513
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,499
I've been trying to her off the street,

514
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,300
find her someplace safe.

515
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,899
But she wouldn't go.

516
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
She said she couldn't sleep--

517
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,299
unless she could hear the ocean.

518
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,699
It's because she didn't have peace in her heart.

519
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,799
I found mine through the lord,

520
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,499
and now I'm two years sober,

521
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,900
and nearly that long off the street.

522
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,699
She was a beautiful person,sir,

523
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,100
but she was powerless against the booze.

524
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,300
She ever say anything about,uh...

525
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
a family?

526
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,599
Sir,her family died.

527
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,399
She had a husband and a son once,back in denver,colorado.

528
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,099
They died in a car crash.

529
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
She came out here to start over.

530
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,199
I don't have no idea who shot her,

531
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,700
but I can tell you right now that's what really killed her.

532
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,399
I guess you think I ought've listened to mickey.

533
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,699
I'm in no position to judge.

534
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,500
It hasn't stopped you yet.

535
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,600
So you wanna tell me again how I didn't
have to go around acting all crazy?

536
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,099
I couldn't have known about your family.

537
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,600
No,but you could've cut me some slack.

538
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,499
Remember the old saying?

539
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,200
"To understand all is to forgive all."

540
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,499
Lance?

541
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,599
You owe me,big time.

542
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,299
What are these?

543
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,499
The complete records of the portfolio account
established in alice brody's name.

544
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,699
It was gonna take two weeks to
get them through channels,

545
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,199
so I went to the branch office account manager.

546
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,799
Well,men are just putty in your hands,aren't they?

547
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,799
Mm,this one was.

548
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,799
Look,I don't think women should use
their bodies as weapons,but...

549
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,099
but it works.

550
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,799
I got the scars to prove it.

551
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,999
Whoever was using our vic's identity traded
exclusively in small companies,

552
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,399
what they call micro-caps.

553
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,699
Buying 600,800 shares at a time,

554
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,299
and then selling them the next day.

555
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,399
that's unusual?

556
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,199
It is when they make money every time.

557
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,499
Or so douglas tells me.

558
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,699
Douglas thinks it's insider trading?

559
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,199
He said the stocks rang a bell.

560
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,399
And then he remembered why.

561
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,899
Every day,about an hour after the market closes,

562
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,399
he starts getting calls from clients,

563
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,999
asking about certain stocks.

564
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,800
Turns out,they've all been watching the same show on tv.

565
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,400
Psst,listen to me.

566
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,420
Morality and ethics have no place in your investment strategy!

567
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,970
If you wanna make crazy money,then you have got to go beyond good and evil,

568
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,790
as my good friend mr.Nietzsche says.

569
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,130
Nietzsche,nietzsche,nietzsche!

570
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,580
Enough...is never enough!

571
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,790
What's our motto?

572
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,190
Say it with me.

573
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,970
Feed your greed!

574
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,400
"feed your greed," huh?

575
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,950
That'd look good monogrammed on your smoking jacket.

576
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,580
Right over the pocket,I think.

577
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,500
Funny. Why am I watching this?

578
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,560
Well,somebody stole my--my vic's identity,and,uh,

579
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,980
used it to make a bunch of money in the stock market.

580
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,460
And you think that was milt traeger?

581
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,270
Uh,when traeger picks a stock,it pushes the price up.

582
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,700
They call it "the traeger bounce.

583
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,510
" Ah,so the stocks in your vic's account were bought before traeger recommended them?

584
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,410
Yeah,about an hour before.

585
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,080
Then sold the next day to profit from the traeger bounce.

586
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,810
Maybe they're connected.

587
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,680
Maybe not.

588
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,750
Did I mention that,uh,traeger,before he was on the tv,ran a big investment fund?

589
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,700
Left amid rumors of insider trading?

590
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,150
such a pussycat on tv.

591
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,500
All right,use tact.

592
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,650
Hey,what-- it's--it's me.

593
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,620
Exactly.

594
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,090
good night,michael.

595
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,120
So detective... this is where the magic happens,huh?

596
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,870
The set looks a lot bigger on tv.

597
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,870
So do I,for that matter.

598
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,530
- Oh,yeah- - hey,guys,great show.

599
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,410
Grt.

600
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,270
Hope you don't mind.

601
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,690
I am starving.

602
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,440
No,please,please.

603
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,900
Well,like I said before,there's no way anybody here's doing insider trading.

604
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,480
Everybody who works here has to give me a complete record of their finances every month.

605
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,090
Tammy,follow with a plate,huh?

606
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:42,110
On top of that,couple of times a year,the sec goes through here with a fine-tooth comb.

607
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,630
Huh?

608
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,990
That's how I know nobody on my show could be involved.

609
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,570
I see. Well,that's a shame then.

610
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,670
Why a shame?

611
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,440
Ah,'cause that would seem to leave only you.

612
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,390
Look,detective,I'm may be crazy,but I'm not nuts,huh?

613
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,830
Yeah,I throw furniture,I smash things up against the wall,

614
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,820
but at the end of the day,I've got a job that I love,and they pay me crazy money to do it,huh?

615
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,970
Why would I risk all that for a lousy couple of hundred thousand bucks?

616
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,780
Why enron?

617
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,490
Why worldcom?

618
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,440
Why--why do rich people ever game the system?

619
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,090
Look,detective,why are you really here,huh?

620
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,030
Insider trading isn't lapd jurisdiction.

621
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,620
But the sec doesn't handle murder.

622
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,760
Who's dead?

623
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,620
The homeless woman whose name was on the e-trading account.

624
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,880
She was asking questions,somebody shot her.

625
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,710
And the paper trail leads right here to this studio.

626
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,570
I make my final picks in the makeup chair.

627
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,260
And tammy here hand-delivers them to three people.

628
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,370
The director.

629
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,840
Surrounded by technicians,up against a deadline.

630
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,870
Hasn't got time to piss,no less buy and sell stocks.

631
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,750
And on the other side of the booth,I got my chyron guy.

632
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,770
All the words you see on the screen?

633
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,770
He puts them there.

634
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,150
Security camera in the room.

635
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,710
No way it's him either.

636
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,480
And we have my teleprompter guy.

637
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,200
Sits right here,under constant scrutiny.

638
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,390
I mean,what's he gonna do,call his broker?

639
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,450
No way.

640
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,910
And that's it,that's team traeger.

641
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,540
Nobody else sees the list?

642
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,330
Nobody.

643
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,990
Well,okay,milt.

644
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,540
Uh,but I gotta tell you,I'm getting the feeling that you're not,uh--

645
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,950
you're not being giving me the straight dope.

646
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,540
no,he is.

647
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,840
But he forgot to tell you that the director has me give jason a copy too.

648
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,000
Who's jason?

649
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,550
Some graphics whiz kid outta cal arts.

650
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,800
He told the director he needed the list so he could grab stock symbols online before the show.

651
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,750
I'm sorry,mr.Traeger.

652
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,070
Are you kidding me?

653
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,870
You just saved my ass!

654
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,110
I hired her 'cause she was gorgeous.

655
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,670
Who knew she was smart too?

656
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,910
Right.

657
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,140
Does jason have a last name?

658
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,240
kitman.

659
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,640
Jason kitman.

660
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,270
K-I-t-m-a-N.

661
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,080
you can't take my computers!

662
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,150
yes,we can,jason.

663
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,850
Read the warrant.

664
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,850
Uh,does traeger really-- really pay you enough to live like this?

665
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,750
I inherited some money.

666
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,960
Look...

667
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,290
there's proprietary software on those.

668
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,280
I'll can show you anything you wanna see.

669
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,300
No,no,thanks,we get a big kick out of poking around for ourselves.

670
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,530
Somebody isn't happy.

671
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,330
Wegman,shut up!

672
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,040
Wegman?

673
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,260
You're wasting your time.

674
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,500
There's nothing to find.

675
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,400
No?

676
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,140
Pick up,uh,the computers in a couple of hours at the station.

677
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,010
Ask for detective raines.

678
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,150
That's about your 10th cup.

679
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,300
What're you,the caffeine police?

680
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,870
This is how I stay one step ahead of bad guys like jason kitman.

681
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,700
Who,by the way,I think killed you.

682
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,110
I still think traeger did it.

683
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,630
Kitman's just a patsy.

684
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,320
Uh,lee oswald was a patsy; kitman's a suspect.

685
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,100
Traeger,I don't like him any more than you do,but he didn't kill you.

686
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,900
If you say so.

687
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,230
But isn't it funny how some crazy people end up on the street,and some end up on tv.

688
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,390
Lance,how are we coming with the kitman's computers?

689
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,510
Slow. He's built in all kinds of trapdoors.

690
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,490
It's a minefield.

691
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,050
Mr.Kitman must have a lot to hide.

692
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,490
say it a little louder,maybe he'll hear you over in reception.

693
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,100
Really?

694
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,450
He wants his computers back,by the way.

695
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,620
Uh,tell him uh-- I'll be with him shortly.

696
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,210
Will do.

697
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,300
Oh,I contacted the denver sheriff's department yesterday about our vic.

698
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,510
Got a call back from a deputy who's familiar with the case.

699
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,500
Yeah? Can he put us in touch with next of kin?

700
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,090
He says there aren't any.

701
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,310
He's flying out tomorrow to identify the body.

702
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,590
Oh,he doesn't need to do that.

703
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,790
We could,uh,fax him a photograph.

704
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,660
That's what I told him,but he insisted.

705
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,470
What,is this tied to some kind of open investigation?

706
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,290
No,he says no.

707
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,570
He just he knew the family.

708
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,300
Keep me posted.

709
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,720
- All right.  - All right.

710
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,790
When can I have my computers back?

711
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,380
This is an autopsy report.

712
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,800
Are you interested in this kind of thing?

713
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,800
No.

714
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,170
Alice brody.

715
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,370
Homeless woman.

716
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,040
I tell you,whoever-- whoever killed her could've saved themselves the trouble.

717
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,910
"Cirrhosis of the liver,diabetes...

718
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,220
" she was living on borrowed time.

719
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,410
What's this got to do with me?

720
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,070
You shot her.

721
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,480
I've never even heard of her.

722
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,330
You used her identity to set up a bank account,a stock ma portfolio account.

723
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,180
You got a cheap apartment and a phone line in her name.

724
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,140
No,I didn'T.

725
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,960
Sure you did.

726
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,570
The bank manager called that phone,left a message.

727
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,810
That's how you knew that she'd been to the bank.

728
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,110
And that's why you killed her.

729
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,000
You're crazy.

730
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,500
No,maybe just a little ahead of my time.

731
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,430
But you,you're kinda-- kinda brilliant.

732
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,920
I mean,the genius of using a homeless person's identity

733
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,200
is that they're not gonna miss it 'cause they don't use it anyway.

734
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,770
I didn't steal anything.

735
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,820
Well,let's see.

736
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,040
You got kicked out of cal arts for stealing software.

737
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,310
That was political.

738
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,400
Political... you've lost five jobs over allegations of theft or impropriety.

739
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,280
It doesn't mean that I shot some pathetic homeless person.

740
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,220
You also own a gun.

741
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,960
Owned a gun.

742
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,800
38.

743
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,290
It was stolen out of my car.

744
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,240
Any proof of that?

745
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,180
Other than the theft report you filed monday?

746
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,830
It's a little hard to prove a negative,detective.

747
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,640
It's hard to prove that I don't have the gun that I didn't shoot this homeless person with.

748
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,200
That's a double negative,and two no's make a yes,yes?

749
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,910
I'm out of here.

750
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,050
Fine,just don't leave town.

751
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,810
Did you find mr. Kitman's car?

752
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,480
It's the only brand-new candy apple red convertible on the lot.

753
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,420
Where'd you put the transmitter?

754
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,930
Uh,right rear wheel well.

755
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,400
If he leaves town in the next 24 hours,we'll know about it.

756
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,580
do you know uh,this man?

757
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,730
I keep tabs on all the volunteers,and I've never seen him here.

758
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,630
- Really?  - No.

759
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,920
Nobody recognized him from any of the other shelters?

760
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,920
Uh...

761
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,710
you're the only one who answered the phone.

762
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,440
Oh.

763
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,820
You always work this late?

764
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,820
Pretty much.

765
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
And you?

766
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,400
Uh,only when I'm on a case,you know.

767
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,340
You're a homicide detective in los angeles.

768
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,500
You're always on a case.

769
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,860
Yeah.

770
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,090
Beats sleeping,huh?

771
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,350
Why,do I look-- do I look tired?

772
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,370
Tell me the truth-- do I?

773
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,980
You look like I feel.

774
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,110
Hmm...

775
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,900
but I guess when you really care,you do what you have to,right?

776
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,100
Hmm.

777
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,150
Is that--

778
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,460
I couldn't sleep.

779
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,710
Thanks,now neither can I.

780
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,530
You haven't really been able to sleep since the night charlie died,have you,dear?

781
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,050
Go away,alice,please.

782
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,360
Oh,you don't really want me to go away and leave you all alone in the dark.

783
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,440
Isn't that the whole point of keeping me around?

784
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,360
No.

785
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,580
The point of keeping you around is to help solve your murder.

786
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,650
You go right ahead believing that,darling.

787
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,440
Now come over here.

788
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,810
I've laid out a lovely tea.

789
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,060
There. Cream and sugar?

790
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,880
No,thank you.

791
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,360
You know,I really admire the way that you've handledall this,michael.

792
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,060
All what?

793
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,570
Losing charlie and all.

794
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,060
And believe me,I know a thing or two about losing people.

795
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,790
But here you are,deeply damaged,

796
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,310
and yet continuing to go about your business like a good soldier.

797
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,420
Not like me.

798
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,120
I was not a good soldier.

799
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,760
No.

800
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,930
I just fell right down the rabbit hole.

801
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,090
Is that where we are? Down the rabbit hole?

802
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,320
That's right,dear.

803
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,630
And this is-- this is a mad tea party?

804
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,190
Of course it is.

805
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,700
We're all mad here. Aren't we?

806
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,470
I don't know,alice.

807
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,650
Maybe we are.

808
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,120
Uh,deputy mark jessup?

809
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,030
Detective raines?

810
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,960
Yeah.

811
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,660
Did I keep you waiting?

812
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,760
Just got in.

813
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,650
How was the flight from denver?

814
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,950
Uneventful.

815
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,100
Can you identify this woman as uh,alice brody?

816
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,070
Yeah.

817
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,030
Okay.

818
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,720
What happened-- what happened to her?

819
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,220
Uh,gunshot.

820
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,460
No,before--before that.

821
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,690
Oh,is... yeah. She was living on the street for a few years.

822
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,160
Got in a cycle of alcoholism and depression.

823
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,090
You know. After she lost her family.

824
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,350
Lost her family?

825
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,450
Yeah,the accident.

826
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,900
There wasn't any accident.

827
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,940
She walked out.

828
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,140
Walked out?

829
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,470
Deserted.

830
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,130
Who exactly,uh... was she to you,deputy?

831
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,610
you didn't just know the family.

832
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,030
You're her family?

833
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,710
She was my mother.

834
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:50,560
I pictured her doing a million different things without us...

835
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,680
I never imagined this.

836
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,240
What do you mean? You never had any,uh...

837
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,700
warning or indication coming up that she...?

838
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,040
She cried a lot,and,um...

839
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,670
she used to lock herself up in her room,and she wouldn't let anybody in.

840
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,450
Then she quit cleaning,she quit fixing meals.

841
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,590
There wasn't a-- a day's peace in that house.

842
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,290
And then one day,I got home from school and...

843
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,690
she was just--just gone.

844
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,030
I'm sorry.

845
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,060
No,don't be.

846
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,790
'Cause I learned about the-- the hard line between chaos and order.

847
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,270
And... I knew which side of that line I had to be on.

848
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,490
It's no accident that we're-- that we're cops,you know?

849
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,020
How do you wanna handle,uh... the funeral arrangements?

850
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,410
Oh,treat her like you would any other indigent.

851
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,370
Are you sure about that?

852
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,480
You know what they'll do with her?

853
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm not taking her home.

854
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,930
Look,I've spent my whole life saying good-bye to her,detective,and...

855
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,770
I just...

856
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,990
I just-- I can't do that anymore,so...

857
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,850
you think he's right about me.

858
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,160
I saw it in your face.

859
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,990
You think I'm some kind of a monster.

860
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,520
I don't know what I think,alice.

861
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,970
Please go back and talk to him.

862
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,260
[Sighs] Tell him I spent the rest of my life paying for what I did.

863
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,680
Tell him that that's what made me a drunk and put me out on the streets. Please,I--please.

864
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,860
What kind of a monster would walk out on her family?

865
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,600
You tell me.

866
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,480
[Cell phone ringing] Raines.

867
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,060
(Boyer on phone) kitman's making a run for it!

868
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,210
Boyer,slow down.

869
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,330
What--what happened?

870
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,850
I tracked his car heading to the airport.

871
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,700
So I put a cruiser on his tail.

872
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,780
He took off!

873
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,970
Now we got him cornered down in westchester.

874
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,490
Hang on,I'll call you back!

875
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,680
Whoa!

876
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,280
Hey! Hey!

877
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,660
Let me see your hands!

878
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,520
Get out of the car.

879
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,820
Right there! Right there!

880
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,180
Down! Get down! Get down!

881
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,230
How'd you get this car?

882
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,480
I found the keys in the door.

883
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,680
You got him?

884
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,720
Come on!

885
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,500
[Cell phone ringing] Boyer,what's going on?

886
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,210
Raines...

887
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,090
no,it's kitman's car.

888
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,860
But kitman's not in it.

889
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,660
So who is?

890
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,510
Some kid.

891
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,460
Says he found the keys in the door and took it for a ride.

892
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,600
Then where's kitman?

893
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,280
Jason kitman. Lapd.

894
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Get somebody from animal control down here.

895
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,900
uh,you don't need to do that.

896
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,130
I live next door.

897
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,280

00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,420
- Thanks.  - Sure.

900
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,830
That's a good boy.

901
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,410
Come on. Come on,boy. That's a good boy.

902
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,340
let's go.

903
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,430
clear.

904
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,460
I told you not to leave town.

905
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,980
Maybe I should've been more specific.

906
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,870
jason's dead.

907
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,960
Oh,no.

908
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,620
Died a few hours ago of a-- of a gunshot.

909
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,500
Oh...

910
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,630
I thought I heard a door slam about 2:30 last night.

911
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,780
Woke me up.

912
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,210
You think that could've been the gunshot?

913
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,480
Maybe.

914
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,260
Did you hear anything else?

915
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,820
Voices,arguing,shouting?

916
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,210
No,nothing.

917
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,250
[Dog growling and barking] It's okay. It's okay.

918
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,510
Did the dog bark?

919
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,850
Not until you guys showed up.

920
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,910
Why?

921
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,050
Ever read sherlock holmes?

922
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,160
The dog didn't bark.

923
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,060
That was the curious incident.

924
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,050
Wegman...

925
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,850
where did you come from?

926
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,960
He's with me.

927
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,320
He usually doesn't take to strangers.

928
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,210
But then,you're-- you're not really a stranger,are you?

929
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,060
You and jason kitman were,uh...

930
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,910
practically neighbors.

931
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,410
What,you met walking your dogs?

932
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,610
Jason's hard drive held records of,uh,a dozen online portfolio accounts worth...

933
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,520
oh,you know,easily half a million bucks.

934
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,050
These are,uh,the booking photos of some of the people whose names are on the accounts.

935
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,740
Public intoxication,panhandling,vagrancy,public exposure.

936
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,550
You know,jason knew how to work the scam,

937
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,340
but he couldn't set up the accounts without names and social security numbers.

938
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,060
When you told him that you worked with the homeless,he must've thought it was his lucky day,huh?

939
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,800
I only knew him from the dog park.

940
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,780
We never discussed the work we did.

941
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,290
You told me yesterday that you didn't recognize him.

942
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,650
You showed me an old driver's license photo.

943
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,690
It was completely out of context.

944
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,290
What was it,a robin hood thing?

945
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,970
Take from the rich,give to the poor?

946
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,370
I didn't have anything to do with it.

947
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,460
That's not who I am.

948
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,930
about six months ago,a real estate developer bought your whole block.

949
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,900
I saw that construction going on,and I made a few calls.

950
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,290
It seems that the owner... uh,wanted to force you out.

951
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,530
So he raised your rent from 1,800 a month to 12,000.

952
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,490
Maybe meeting jason seemed like your lucky day too.

953
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,850
People are starving to death on the streets of the richest country on earth.

954
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,320
I had to do something.

955
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,700
I couldn't let them drive us out.

956
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,620
I was just taking back a little of what they'd stolen.

957
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,450
But you... killed jason kitman.

958
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,790
I know that you hoped that it would look like a suicide,

959
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,150
but we found your fingerprints inside the trunk of his car.

960
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,810
What were you doing,searching for incriminating records after you shot him?

961
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,800
I did not shoot him.

962
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,210
Helen,look.

963
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,680
When you fire a gun-- I'll show you something.

964
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,120
Um,there are traces of powder get embedded in the skin.

965
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,180
Here.

966
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,420
They can't wash out.

967
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,250
What are we gonna find when we test your hands,helen?

968
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,230
Okay.

969
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:15,330
When alice brody started asking about the bank account,jason panicked,right?

970
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,230
I told him...

971
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,090
to trust me,that I would find her and I would talk to her.

972
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,120
She was completely harmless.

973
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,000
Right,but he didn't trust you.

974
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,560
He followed you,waited till she fell asleep,and shot her.

975
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,620
I didn't wanna believe that.

976
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,320
Huh?

977
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,890
But when I tried to call him,he wouldn't pick up.

978
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,550
He wouldn't return my calls.

979
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,340
Right,so you went over to his place last night.

980
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,060
And...

981
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,860
what happened?

982
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,740
(Helen) he was packing to leave town.

983
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,980
I saw a gun in the suitcase.

984
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,920
I asked him if it was the gun he used to kill alice.

985
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,990
He said that he was just putting her out of her misery.

986
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,880
He said that only the strong survive.

987
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,790
I'd never seen this side of him.

988
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,720
Something made you pick up that gun.

989
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,840
What was it?

990
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,200
He said I wasn't any better than he was.

991
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,110
And I couldn't stop myself.

992
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:16,910
I just...

993
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,480
pulled the trigger.

994
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,880
He shot a sleeping homeless woman.

995
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,330
He couldn't see her.

996
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,660
She wasn't a person to him.

997
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,030
I though you might like it out here.

998
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,820
Look,alice...

999
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,150
the thing is,uh...

1000
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:09,280
you know,I-- I haven't,uh,quite gotten used to the idea of being-- being crazy yet.

1001
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:16,370
So I look at you and I-- you know,I see what I'm-- I'm afraid that I might become.

1002
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,390
Anyway,I apologize.

1003
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm really-- I'm really sorry.

1004
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,580
You know,I--I can't know what drove you to leave your family.

1005
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:32,670
But I do know that,uh,sometimes what looks like a choice,is not really a choice at all.

1006
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,680
It's too bad you're the only one who knows that.

1007
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,150
 Maybe I'm not the only one.

1008
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,360
Thanks for calling me.

1009
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,070
Nice setting.

1010
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:59,580
Yeah,well,you--you told me that she couldn't sleep unless she could hear the ocean.

1011
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,820
I thought you might-- might wanna say a few words.

1012
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,910
Alice.

1013
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,510
You had more good in you than anybody I ever knew,or hope to.

1014
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,580
That's what got me off the street.

1015
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,240
Helped me stay strong,stay sober.

1016
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,040
I just thank god you're at peace now.

1017
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,560
(Samantha) did you ever figure out why alice bothered you so much?

1018
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,710
Well,uh,you know,I guess...

1019
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,390
I was afraid that she was the...

1020
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,320
ghost of christmas yet to come.

1021
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,990
You're afraid you're going to be homeless. Well,that's interesting.

1022
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,960
Why is that interesting?

1023
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:17,330
Well,the main causes of homelessness are economic distress,alcoholism,or psychiatric disorder.

1024
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,470
In your case,money is not the issue,and I don't think you're an alcoholic.

1025
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,490
Not yet,anyway.

1026
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,950
Are you afraid you might be going crazy?

1027
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,130
I'll have to get back to you on that.
