1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,260
Hey,who doesn't love a guy who lives in danger?

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,330
"Then again,the dangers we perceive
aren't often the real ones."

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,650
Take our local fireman,tony vera.
The guy on the boardwalk.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,630
"Last time he burned himself
it was taking a chicken out of the oven."

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,270
"But when he coats his mouth
with that lighter fluid?"

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,700
"Every slug that he ingests,every accidental nip
eats away a little more of his liver."

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,800
Or take my job.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,650
"Jealous husbands with switchblades,
crackheads with semi-automatics."

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,020
Does that sound perilous?

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,980
"In the entire lapd,we had one cop killed
in the line of duty last year."

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,720
And only one the year before.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,260
Well,we did have 13 suicides,though.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,710
Shame they don't make kevlar for the things we see.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,620
are you thinking about killing yourself?

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,360
Detective?

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,350
Yeah.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,340
I asked you a question.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,560
You mentioned suicide,I've gotta ask.

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,780
Are you thinking about killing yourself?

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,620
Every time I walk in this office.

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm not thinking of killing myself.

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,520
All right.

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,220
You also mentioned kevlar for the things you see.

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,960
Were you referring to the vests?

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,200
Well,I didn't mean the canoes.

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,310
"These things you experience,that you see,
you think that they're harmful?"

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,650
Maybe. I don't know.

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,180
Why don't you tell me about the case?

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,530
I thought you knew about the case.
You said you saw it on the news.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,860
Then why don't you tell me?

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,490
We found the body of a ten-year-old girl.

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,310
She'd been stuffed into a duffel bag.

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,230
Kt? What do we got?

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,380
Petechial hemorrhaging,for one.

35
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,720
Strangulation?

36
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,170
No facial congestion,or neck contusions.

37
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,210
Broken neck?

38
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,960
That's my guess.

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,440
she's missing two buttons.

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
and a third is unbuttoned.

41
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,950
"You think her mother let her
leave the house that way?"

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,940
- Boyer.
- Yeah?

43
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,080
We need to throw up a tent.

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,350
You worried about the gulls?

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,430
"No,we need to remove the victim's clothes,
and run a rape kit."

46
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,310
She can't be more than ten years old.

47
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,030
I'm gonna need the keys to your patrol car.

48
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,380
- Boyer?
- Yeah?

49
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,280
The keys to your patrol car!

50
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,820
have you figured out who did it yet?

51
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,950
No,not yet.

52
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,250
How about now?

53
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,060
You're not very good with kids,are you?

54
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,250
Raines.

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,420
"Adam 9 just called in a missing person's report
on a ten-year-old south of rose."

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,780
We're uploading it to the cws database now.

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,440
Give me the highlights.

58
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,250
Emily strong,4'2",red hair,light brown eyes.

59
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,670
What was she wearing?

60
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,690
Pink ruffled top and denim capris.

61
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,330
Yeah,that's her.
Uh,you got an address?

62
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,670
1892 indiana court.
It should be up on the cws by now.

63
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,020
Thanks.

64
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,980
so I have a name.

65
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,090
emily.

66
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,960
Your name is emily.

Yeah,he's with him now.

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,070
I gotta call you back.

72
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,770
Detective.

73
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,970
Bruce.

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,830
What do you know?

75
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,510
"Girl went to westley,had an early dismissal today,
mother had no idea."

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,020
She walk to school?

77
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,920
"Westley let out at 1:00,
mom didn't realize she was missing till 3:00."

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,290
I wanna know why you are not looking for my daughter.

79
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,210
We told you everything we know.

80
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,410
That's the father,he just came home.

81
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,600
You need backup in there?

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,150
You wanna tell him his daughter's dead,be my guest.

83
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,100
I... I have to... oh,my god.

84
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,080
I--I can'T...

85
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,090
I can't believe...

86
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,650
mr.Strong... henry.

87
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,790
Why--why wouldn't she have told us she had a half day?

88
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,430
Henry,I know this is difficult,

89
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,250
but we need to focus on finding out who did this,
and on bringing that person to justice.

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,470
- Any--anything you need.
- Thank you.

91
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,280
I'm gonna need to ask you a few que--

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,250
detective?

93
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,430
Yeah,just a few questions.

94
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,350
Hasn't he been through enough?

95
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,930
It's standard procedure.

96
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,330
Go ahead.

97
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,770
When was the last time you saw emily?

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,090
- This... this morning,before I went to work.
- And you were at work all day?

99
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,360
- Yes,until judy called.
- You didn't go out for lunch?

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,050
- No,I ate at my--
- why are you asking him these questions?

101
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,170
Could emily play the piano?

102
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,940
What?

103
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,380
The piano,can she play?

104
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,000
She was just starting to learn.

105
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,290
"Excuse me,were you just suggesting
that I might have killed--?"

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,700
A young victim in these circumstances,
chances are she knew her attacker,which is why--

107
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,830
I'm sorry. Under what circumstances?

108
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,320
We think your that daughter might
have been sexually assaulted before she was killed.

109
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,930
- Henry
- I told you,I was at work all day.

110
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,330
Do you mind if I,ah,look around?

111
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,450
That wasn't very nice.

112
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,920
I had to gauge his reaction.

113
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,770
"His reaction to the fact that
I might have been assaulted before I was killed?"

114
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,500
Hey,why don't you go play with your dolls?

115
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,090
Want to do that?

116
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,490
I'm tired of my dolls.

117
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,740
What's assault?

118
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,290
None of your beeswax.

119
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,620
Fine.

120
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,380
You like nancy drew?

121
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,140
Never read any.

122
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,600
Really? She's a schoolgirl detective.

123
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,890
I bet she could solve my murder.

124
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,820
I was just starting to learn that song.

125
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,420
My dad was gonna play it with me.

126
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,520
Lucky him.

127
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,840
Hey,maybe you could play it with me.

128
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,810
Ugh,maybe not.

129
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,910
Why are you so cranky?

130
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,630
Why are you so annoying?

131
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,760
I don't know.

132
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,650
Maybe it's easier if I'm annoying.

133
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,910
Easier?

134
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,400
You know,to deal with the fact that I was murdered.

135
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,710
That I'm dead for no good reason.

136
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,790
Okay,isn't there--?

137
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,650
There's got to be something in here to keep you busy.

138
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,890
I could play with my computer.

139
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,670
There you go.

140
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,290
"I mean,there's so much to do,
so many people to talk to."

141
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,540
I just love im,don't you?

142
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,590
Who were you chatting with,emily?

143
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,590
Something wrong?

144
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,170
No.

145
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,070
Don't you want to know who I'm iming?

146
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,960
Wait a minute. You can'T...

147
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,820
im without an e-mail account.

148
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,580
she had an e-mail account.

149
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,640
Henry was so protective.

150
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,370
He didn't want her to have it.

151
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,390
I tried to read everything.

152
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,290
She only e-mailed with a few other girls.

153
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,400
Can you show me her account?

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,890
judy!

155
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,380
Judy!

156
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,170
Henry?

157
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
The tobmans called. Grace,she told them...

158
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,260
"she told them she and emily
lied about the early dismissal."

159
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,120
Grace,that's one of emily's school friends?

160
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,920
Grace tobman.

161
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,300
They snuck down to the beach.

162
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
Henry,where are you going?

163
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,600
You don't want to go outside.

164
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,410
- I need to talk to her.
- No,that's not such a good idea.

165
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,050
I have to do this!
I have to do something.

166
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,220
No,please--  He's taking no questions.

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Don't answer any questions. No questions.

168
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,000
Uh,henry,listen to me,
the best thing you can do right now

169
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,630
is to sit down and start working
on a list of adults who knew emily.

170
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,840
- You don't understand.
- I do understand,henry.

171
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,710
But you gotta let me do my job.

172
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,120
Uh,could you give me the tobmans' number? Please.

173
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,780
"And if you could jot down emily's,
uh,e-mail address and password."

174
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,080
- You don't think that--?
- No,no,I'm just being thorough.

175
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,900
you don't want to tell her that 65% of
sexual solicitations occur through im and chat?

176
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,100
What exactly is a sexual solicitation anyway?

177
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,320
- Lance.
- It's raines.

178
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,840
"Yeah,the media's all over this,

179
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,700
so I'm gonna call the family of the little girl
who last saw emily,send her in."

180
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,090
"Make sure there's somebody there
to roll out the welcome wagon."

181
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah,no problem.

182
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,280
Great. While I've got you,

183
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,790
I'm gonna need a background check
on emily strong's buddy list and e-mail address book.

184
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,240
You got a login and a password?

185
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,670
Estrong@friendpost.Net
Password is lion tamer.

186
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,930
As in siegfried?

187
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,480
Uh,I'm guessing that's not who she had in mind,but yeah.

188
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,740
Is that raines?

189
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,240
Boyer wants to talk to you.

190
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,190
Boyer? Really? What,is it my birthday?

191
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,540
Hey,detective.

192
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,780
"Listen,I'm making a list of suspects
from the N.E.C.S.Database."

193
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,730
"Now,I figured I'd target sex offenders
that live in the strongs' neighborhood."

194
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,220
You're taking initiative? Really?
Is this remi boyer?

195
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,720
Should I be targeting them by crime?

196
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,750
I don't want you to strain anything.

197
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,890
Rape? Sodomy?

198
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,330
Yeah,sure. Anything with a child victim.

199
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,040
And make sure to include guys convicted of se--

200
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,900
hold on,one second.

201
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,110
Shouldn't you be in the back seat?

202
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,600
It's my car. And my head.

203
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,950
Fine.

204
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,040
Uh,yeah. Make sure to include guys convicted of...

205
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,820
"of,um,Sexual abuse or lewd and
lascivious acts with a child."

206
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,300
What?

207
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,910
Sexual abuse or lewd and lascivious acts with a child.

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,340
Why were you whispering?

209
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,570
Because it's easier if I think that you can't hear.

210
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,490
Which I guess sounds pretty stupid,doesn't it?

211
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,450
No stupider than making me sit in the back seat.

212
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,920
That's correct.

213
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,930
"If I'm so innocent,
what was I doing sneaking down to the beach?"

214
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,200
mr.Tobman,this is michael raines.

215
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,680
He's the detective working the case.

216
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,750
- Is grace here?
- In my office.

217
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,530
- Mr.Tobman,please
- uh,detective?

218
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,890
"Before we called the strongs,we were pretty angry
with grace,there was a lot of yelling..."

219
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,620
you haven't told grace yet.

220
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,380
- We didn't want,on the heels of all that
- of course.

221
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,710
grace,this is detective raines.
***

222
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,810
Uh,grace?

223
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,870
Try a little less big and scary.

224
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,340
Yeah.

225
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,930
grace,um,just need to talk to you a little bit.

226
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,690
I need to know what happened.

227
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,940
Yeah?

228
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,520
It's okay,baby.

229
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,380
We wanted to go to the ballet store.

230
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,280
ballet store?

231
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,440
Oh,the one next to the paddle tennis courts?

232
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,510
And walk on the boardwalk.

233
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,650
she loves the boardwalk.

234
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,570
I like the boardwalk too.

235
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,270
Um,so you were on the boardwalk with emily?

236
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,090
We were watching one of the performers.

237
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,420
"But then,emily wasn't there
and I thought she'd gone home so..."

238
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,840
so I did too.

239
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,200
did something bad happen to emily?

240
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,370
Detective?

241
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,030
"Uh,grace,what were you watching when,
uh,emily disappeared?"

242
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,800
Thank you,thank you.Thank you

243
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,870
Hey,don't forget,man,do not try this at home.

244
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,630
I used to be a white dude.

245
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,580
Wow,$20,man,thanks.

246
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,350
So what can I do for you,detective?

247
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,160
Uh,does she look familiar?

248
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,300
"Is that the little girl
they found in the kids' playground?"

249
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,670
Yeah,her friend said she was here at your show today.

250
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,030
Might have been 2:00,2:30?

251
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,620
We think she might have been assaulted.

252
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,980
In my show?

253
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,140
You mean someone was messing with her at my show?

254
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,730
Well,that sicko's been back again,you know?

255
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,360
Oh,that guy that you,uh,ided last year?

256
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,130
Yeah,that scrawny little bastard.

257
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,190
"The one who was messing with kids at my show,
feeling them up."

258
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,470
He's been hanging around again?

259
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,730
Yeah. I saw him last week.

260
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,230
"I mean,I would've chased after him,
but I was juggling four torches and a bowling ball,you know?"

261
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,730
Been there.

262
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
What was his name? Do you remember?

263
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,310
I don't know,but I'm pretty sure you guys got it down.

264
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,920
Yeah,I'll bet.

265
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,710
- Tony,thank you,baby.
- Well,thank you,man.

266
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,320
Just try to go easy on the sauce.

267
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,090
Oh,I will. Thanks for the $20,detective.
I'll pay you back,man.

268
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,010
- You will not.
- I'm serious,man. I'll pay you back,man.

269
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,520
- I love you,tony vera.
- I love you more.

270
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,020
I'll pay you back every dime. Every dime,man.

271
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,370
what's this?

272
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,960
"It's the coroner's report,
and the original tony vera complaint."

273
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,210
The cops couldn't substantiate tony's claim at the time,

274
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,690
but charlie newman,the guy he ided?

275
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,860
"He had a prior for solicitation of a minor,
so we're bringing him in."

276
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,980
- We got a rap sheet on mr.Newman?
- Yeah.

277
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,570
"You know,I can head over to the strongs,
finish up the interview,if you're stuck here."

278
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,490
Really,what did you put on your wheaties this morning?

279
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,190
Nothing. Just doing my job.

280
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,230
Yeah,that's what's so surprising.

281
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,060
This vaginal bruising pretty much confirms sexual assault.

282
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,040
"And they think they may get a dna sample off the pubic hair,"
but,I mean,she didn't have any,

283
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,550
- so they figure the guy
- listen,I can read.

284
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,850
Sexual assault,that's like rape?

285
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,980
Why would someone do that?

286
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,490
I'm ten years old.

287
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,520
Why would god let someone do that?

288
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,060
" we got the guy from
the vera complaint in interrogation."

289
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,930
Charlie newman.

290
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,970
You need a minute?

291
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,370
Yeah,thanks.Yeah.

292
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,870
detective? You didn't answer my question.

293
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,420
Are we ever gonna talk about what happened to me?

294
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,470
Sure.

295
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,670
No,we're not.

296
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,690
You're a ten-year-old figment of my imagination.

297
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,630
So it's difficult?

298
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,110
Difficult,very difficult.

299
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,810
Detective,I don't exist.
You just said so yourself.

300
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,930
That's right.

301
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,430
So it's not me you're avoiding.

302
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,630
Why can't you face this?

303
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,850
Because!

304
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,660
"When you asked me two minutes ago why somebody would
rape and murder a ten-year-old girl,that was me asking."

305
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,250
Don't you get that?

306
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,930
"And because I don't know
why somebody would do that to you."

307
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,070
I don't know why god would let somebody do that to you.

308
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,290
And because...

309
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,850
because you don't know if you can do this anymore.

310
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,320
"Did you wonder about that
when you had the other victims in your head?"

311
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,660
Absolutely,sure.

312
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,090
You know you didn'T.

313
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,790
Okay,little miss wisey pants,no,I didn'T.

314
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,500
I didn't,'cause they were older.

315
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,100
You know my partner,charlie?

316
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,420
"Yeah,it sad and it's tragic that he's dead,
that his son jack is gonna grow up without a father."

317
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,400
But at least he lived long enough to have a son.

318
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,590
And you? All you had was an american girl doll.

319
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,440
- That's sad.
- Well sure,sweetie,isn't it?

320
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,650
The other victims.

321
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,610
They helped you solve their cases.

322
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,170
Detective,how can I help you?

323
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,830
"Unless you read a nancy drew mystery where she
solves a child rape murder,I don't think you can."

324
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,020
Here,here's how you can help me.

325
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,070
"I'm about to go in and interrogate a possible suspect,
a convicted pedophile."

326
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,190
What's a pedophile?

327
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,020
Like that. Don't-- don't--
that's what I can't have you do.

328
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,370
"When I go in there,I can't have you be asking questions
and interfering with my interrogation."

329
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,440
I gotta focus.

330
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,080
So could you stay out here while I'm there?

331
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,420
That's how you can help.

332
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,790
It's your head,detective.

333
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,290
Just stop thinking about me.

334
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,700
"If you haven't noticed,I don't exactly
have complete control over my delightful imagination."

335
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,530
You should talk to someone about that.

336
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,660
Yeah,thank you.

337
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,400
Could you do that,please? I'm asking nicely.

338
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,520
Okay.

339
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,120
- Thank you.
- On one condition.

340
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,400
Ultimatums?

341
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,470
"When we're done with my case,
we'll play the song I was learning."

342
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,510
You know how I feel about that song.

343
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,810
I'll teach you one note samba.

344
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,800
- detective!
- Yeah?

345
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,820
- You ready?
- Here I come.

346
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,090
well hello,mr.Charlie newman.

347
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,660
Mr.Charles newman,I'm detective raines.

348
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,250
Thank you very,very much for coming in.

349
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,730
Are you nervous about something?

350
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,550
No.

351
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,840
'Cause really,charlie-- can I call you charlie?

352
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,230
Man,there's nothing to be nervous about.

353
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,820
Everybody's got a thing,you know?

354
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,660
I can sympathize.

355
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,100
Hey,I like...

356
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,910
I like younger women.

357
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,600
Maybe not quite as young as you,but,you know,19,18.

358
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,170
French.

359
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,340
You know,a one piece.
Preferably a nice riviera tan.

360
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,770
And sure,there are people,charlie,
I don't know them personally,

361
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,240
but I'm told there are people who think that...

362
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,220
I'm too old?

363
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,860
That it's disgusting.

364
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,250
Can you imagine?

365
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,150
Are you with me? But you know what I say?

366
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,440
I say screw 'em.

367
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,420
Screw them and their,frankly,uh,bourgeois sensibility.

368
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Their protestant moral code.

369
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,970
That's what I say.

370
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,660
How about you,charlie? What do you say?

371
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,940
"I say I'm tired of getting hauled in here
every time a little girl is molested."

372
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,850
Did I mention that a little girl was molested?

373
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,440
"No,but every time one is,you pull my name up
on the database and you bring me in."

374
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,680
Charlie,that's what you get for molesting little girls.

375
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,070
She was standing on a street corner.

376
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,560
She looked like she was 22.

377
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,280
I make one mistake,and I'm marked for life.

378
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,170
"And thanks to that damn megan's law,
it's out there for all the world to see."

379
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,540
"Do you know how many times I've had to move
because of uptight landlords and crazy vigilantes?"

380
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Welcome to los angeles.

381
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,930
over here.

382
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,170
Thank you very much for staying out here.

383
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,870
I was just trying to help.

384
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,310
I lied before.

385
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,980
"When I was your age,the hardy boys,
I was really into it."

386
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,840
"I read every single one,then one day I got kind of curious
about the girl detective,so I read nancy drew."

387
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,900
And I liked it very much.

388
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,430
I know.

389
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,090
Do you think he did it?

390
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,350
Charlie newman?

391
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,810
"Well we're checking out his alibi,
but no history of violence,no prior contact with you..."

392
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,840
detective,we don't have any other leads.

393
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,160
No,we don'T.

394
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,830
What if we don't find him?

395
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,310
What if we don't find the guy who did this to me?

396
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,730
- Hey.
- Hey.

397
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,870
How's the investigation?

398
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,120
Oh,the investigation is swell.

399
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,230
"no witnesses,nothing from the scene,
no prints on the duffel."

400
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,200
It was canvas?

401
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,520
Mm-hmm,and the tobman lead,dead end.

402
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,740
How about the emails?

403
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,960
"One of the addresses in her address book was
bounced off another site,raised a red flag with the isp."

404
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,210
- Which means?
- I have no idea.

405
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,160
Lance is tracking that down?

406
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,210
Okay.

407
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,490
All right.

408
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,460
" Tomorrow morning,I want to go public
with the fact that she was assaulted."

409
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,430
Oh.

410
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,880
"Hang on,we haven't canvassed the neighbors,
talked to her teachers--"

411
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,290
yeah,but you know what?
I've have half the city breathing down my neck.

412
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,240
"We're working off a database of what,
500 recent offenders?"

413
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,020
If there's a nervous witness out there...

414
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,780
yay,collect calls from half the nuts in venice.

415
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,440
"It's gonna be like our very own red carpet
show for the megalomaniacally insane."

416
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,640
- Michael.
- Its gonna traumatize the family.

417
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,170
Which is why you'll run it by them first.

418
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,240
I'd be happy to send lance.

419
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,440
Or boyer.

420
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,660
CA Sex Offemder Database

421
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,930
how do you protect them?

422
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,290
How do you...?

423
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,140
God.I mean,we could have moved.

424
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,920
Where?

425
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,900
She loved the beach.We all did.

426
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,450
I mean,what was I supposed to do?

427
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,130
You alarm the house.

428
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,340
Check on her at night. You hold her hand.

429
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,560
"And one day,she decides
she's old enough to walk to school alone."

430
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,550
"I mean,it's only five blocks,
and so you think about it,you say no."

431
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:45,970
And then after six months of crying,
and carrying on and drama,you say yes.

432
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,230
You say yes.

433
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,420
"All the time,you have no idea
that this is living all around you."

434
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,910
You've confirmed it,haven't you?

435
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,940
She was molested.

436
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,130
henry...

437
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,290
"we think it would be best
for the investigation if we told the public."

438
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,570
Excuse me?

439
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,890
"Yeah,often,um,if the public hears
that a young child has been,uh,"

440
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,910
harmed in this way,they react strongly.Helpfully.

441
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,100
Reluctant witnesses become less reluctant.

442
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,490
I haven't told judy yet.

443
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,390
Let me tell judy.

444
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,780
We have to find him.

445
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,980
Maybe you should take a break.

446
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,980
Why?

447
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,520
We could play the song.

448
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,700
Ugh,we haven't solved the case yet.

449
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,740
"And,uh,I don't think my neighbors
would appreciate being serenaded at this hour."

450
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Can I play?

451
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,540
- They won't hear me.
- I will.

452
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,400
These are cool.

453
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,140
Thank you.

454
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,450
You have a lot of toys.

455
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,590
"Do you think it's
because you didn't have any as a kid?"

456
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,740
isn't it past your bedtime?

457
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,830
Isn't it past your bedtime?

458
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,970
Why don't you have any kids?

459
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,930
'Cause they irritate me.

460
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,440
'Cause I didn't have time.

461
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,980
"Cause I didn't wanna,uh,
lose another argument with my ex-wife."

462
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,650
Seeing me makes you regret not having kids,doesn't it?

463
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,540
There were 800,000 kids kidnapped in the U.S.Last year.

464
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,570
"Sure,only 50 were killed,
but that's still one a week."

465
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
"And all those parents' lives,
they're ruined and destroyed"

466
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,320
"because the thing they love most
in the world is gone forever."

467
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,120
Or so I imagine.

468
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,030
You know,even my wonderful imagination has limits.

469
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,550
What your parents are going through now...

470
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,400
I-- I--I don't know.

471
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,910
I don't know.

472
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,290
"It's a dark gray ocean
whose depths I'm never gonna know."

473
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,810
Don't really wanna know. So...

474
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,620
seeing you?

475
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,060
"Frankly,kinda--kinda makes me glad
that I've never had kids."

476
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,810
Okay then.

477
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,870
Okay then.

478
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,960
Lapd homicide hotline,detective boyer speaking.

479
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,640
No,she didn't have a nose ring. She's ten.

480
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,800
Remember,service with a smile.

481
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,800
Homicide hotline.

482
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,710
- Good morning.
- Is it?

483
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,530
"You know some people like to start the day
with some breakfast,some coffee,sleep..."

484
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,610
"we've got two convicted sex offenders
living a block away from the strongs?"

485
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,570
" yeah,one's back in jail,the other has an alibi,
but you know,it's shaky,I'm looking into it."

486
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,300
What about the bounced email address?

487
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,370
Belongs to gary marsh,emily's teacher.

488
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,190
A 4th grade teacher emailing a student?

489
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,260
Boyer said they were general assignments,
apparently he cced the entire class.

490
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,250
I can go grab them...

491
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,870
of course,mrs.Strong,but I wouldn't jump to any...

492
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,130
I'm sorry,could you hang on a second?

493
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,530
"It's judy strong,she's been up all night
poring over the megan's law site."

494
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,270
"There's a handyman who worked at
their house a few months ago."

495
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,250
What's his name?

496
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,080
I'm sorry,mrs.Strong,what'S...

497
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,030
she says his name is charlie newman.

498
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,870
Mr.Newman? Charlie?

499
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,680
damn megan's law.

500
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,470
There's nothing at the back exit.

501
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,930
"You want me to cordon off the floor
and set up a security log?"

502
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,920
hi there,little girl.

503
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,170
I never did catch your name.

504
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,930
Detective? You--you want...?

505
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,900
I just got a new puppy back at my house.
You wanna go see him?

506
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:15,660
Detective?

507
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,620
I'm scared.

508
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,980
It's right this way.

509
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,930
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

510
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,680
come on. It's right down the hall.

511
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,270
- No.
- Come on,sweetheart. Come on.

512
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,450
- You sure I shouldn't
- I want everyone out until S.I.D

513
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,720
- leave me alone!
- no,no,no.

514
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,340
Come on,sweetheart. Come on,sweetheart.

515
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,940
- Come on.
- Leave me alone.

516
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,500
- Detective?
- Come on!

517
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,500
I don't want to.

518
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,260
It's a little puppy.

519
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,930
Little yellow puppy.

520
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,030
- Detective?
- You're gonna like him.

521
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,900
I'm not gonna hurt you!

522
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,900
Listen to me.I need you and
everybody else to get out of the buil---

523
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,860
Thanks,detective.

524
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,430
detective?

525
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,020
Wait for S.I.D.

526
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,870
you're just gonna let her do that to me.

527
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,980
Yeah.

528
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,780
Well,I guess that figures.

529
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,590
"You know,between the megan's law website
and the newsflash that poor,"

530
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,100
"sweet emily was molested,you might as well
just stuck a bull's-eye on my back."

531
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,090
You're not talking to me? Well,fine. Fine.

532
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,250
You know what?Just another innocent man,

533
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,680
"condemned to die at the hands
of an overzealous constabulary."

534
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,140
"You know what,next time,
why don't you just hand out pitchforks"

535
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,200
and torches to every idiot with a batman complex and

536
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,320
nice shot.

537
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,640
Daddy never let me play with guns.

538
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,600
Don't listen to newman.

539
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,580
He so got what he deserved.

540
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,980
you know he did it.

541
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,620
"What he knows is that recidivism rates
for sex offenders is dramatically overstated,"

542
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,590
"that only 13% repeat,and that all the evidence
that he has is circumstantial."

543
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,740
Not to mention the fact that you lived down
the block from a convicted sex offender,

544
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,600
who,from what I hear,has a rather shaky alibi.

545
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,910
they'll run a dna test,prove it was you.

546
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,800
They'll run a dna test to prove it was you.

547
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,460
Where are we going?

548
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,610
come on now,you're a bright girl.

549
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,650
Who do you think did this to me?

550
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,910
You have anything for me,detective?

551
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,410
Sorry,betty,you know I try not to feed the animals.

552
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,590
he didn't do it!

553
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,430
Just because he was upset,doesn't mean that he...

554
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,830
please. Please.

555
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,170
Where is he,judy?

556
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,890
and she had no idea where he was?

557
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,230
no,sir.

558
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,420
all right.

559
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,960
- Let's put out a warrant and want on mr.Strong.
- okay.

560
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,280
Carolyn,keep it away from the press.

561
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,640
And see if you can get the deputy chief on the line.

562
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,050
Are you okay?

563
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,550
Dandy.

564
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,730
My daddy didn't do anything wrong!

565
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,830
Really? Because you don't look so hot.

566
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,000
Why can't you leave him alone?

567
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,580
Don't listen to her. She's just a child.

568
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,180
You want some aspirin?

569
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,980
Think that'll do the trick?

570
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,830
Michael,you did your job,you found her killer.

571
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,540
Well,still we don't know that.

572
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,360
No,we do know that.

573
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,390
"We just got a dna match off
the hair at the crime scene."

574
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,050
Like that proves anything.

575
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,930
I could have an identical brother. Or sister.

576
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,560
My point is,I can put somebody else on the case.

577
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,790
You don't have to finish this.

578
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,560
No,I do.

579
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,470
I have to. It's my job.

580
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,050
didn't my daddy do your job for you?

581
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,580
What...

582
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,070
henry did was wrong.

583
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:32,450
"Sometimes justice,what we think of as justice,
it has to take a backseseat to law and order."

584
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,230
what's up?

585
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,050
"Hey,we've got a 5150 matching
henry strong's description."

586
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,870
He's at the hollywood zoo.

587
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,270
At the zoo? Why would he be at the zoo?

588
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,380
one of her teacher's online assignments.

589
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,200
Her winter break essay?

590
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,390
My birthday was over break so...

591
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,710
my daddy and I did what we always do on my birthday...

592
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,620
we went to the zoo to visit the lions.

593
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,230
Isn't it strange?

594
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,060
"Even though I'm almost all grown up,
I still love the lions."

595
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,440
All right. Get over there.

596
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,240
we're gonna go lock him up and throw away the key.

597
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,270
Please. Tell everyone to turn around.

598
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,950
Sometimes justice has to take a back seat
to law and order.Right,detective?

599
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,980
Please. Just turn around.

600
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,880
Don't worry,nobody's gonna hurt your dad.

601
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,880
Hey,hey,hey! Hands off.

602
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,960
- Hey,she's the one that keeps shooting me.
- Stay away from her.

603
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,460
- If I have to stop this car
- he deserves it!

604
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,020
- Raines.
- Detective raines,this is dr.Kohl.

605
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,300
Oh,no--not a good time.

606
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,100
See? You should turn around and go to therapy.

607
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,360
I'm a dealing with a double homicide here.

608
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,060
We had an appointment at noon.

609
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,830
- He doesn't need therapy,he needs to arrest your father.
- If you're going to miss an appointment you need to

610
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,100
shut up! Shut--

611
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,220
detective?

612
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,740
Sorry,that was-- I'm working two phones here.

613
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,200
"Look,I've got to go arrest somebody for
killing the guy who murdered his daughter."

614
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
"I don't have time to be
scheduling therapy appointments,doctor."

615
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,110
Look,I've got some time this evening.

616
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Maybe you,uh...maybe you wanna stop by.

617
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:16,460
Uh...yeah-- yeah,I gotta go.

618
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,950
What's going on?

619
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,910
They made a positive id on the guy. It's mr.Strong.

620
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,150
Is he okay?

621
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,470
He's got a gun.
He's threatening to kill himself.

622
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,770
Stay back.

623
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,580
Just wanna-- just wanna see you.

624
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,060
Do you have a gun?

625
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,380
What am I gonna do,shoot you?

626
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,040
No.

627
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,600
Oh,henry.

628
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,220
I wish you hadn't,uh,killed him.

629
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,480
You don't think he deserved to die?

630
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,010
Well...sure.

631
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,370
"Hey,if I were you,
I probably would've killed him myself."

632
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,240
But look where it's brought you.

633
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,390
she used to be afraid of them,you know.

634
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,380
When she was little.

635
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,010
She wouldn't go near the fence.

636
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,380
She'd make me stand a good ten feet away.

637
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,300
A jury is gonna have a lot of sympathy for your story.

638
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,580
I don't want sympathy,I want my daughter back.

639
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,300
Henry...

640
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,390
are you thinking of killing yourself?

641
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,790
It's better that way.

642
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,930
- It's easier.
- Oh!For who?

643
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,320
Judy?

644
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,920
And how about emily?

645
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,270
What about her?

646
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,070
Can you see her?

647
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,590
What?

648
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,640
Imagine.

649
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:26,420
Right here.Right now.Right next to you.

650
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,740
You can even close your eyes.

651
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,730
Do you see her?

652
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,810
I can.

653
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,450
She's such a beautiful girl.

654
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,290
So full of life.

655
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,440
You can kinda-- kinda see her,can't you?

656
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,640
That beautiful girl lives in you,henry.

657
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:57,860
And if you're not here to talk about her,
and remember her,and share her stories...

658
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,730
Henry,if you kill yourself,she'll die all over again.

659
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,580
Take it easy,take it easy.

660
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,670
Yeah,henry,I'll put it in your pocket.

661
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,900
" I know everybody's wondering
why I've been busting my ass."

662
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,080
You saw the girl in that duffel.

663
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,120
"First thing,all I could think about
was how much I hate this job."

664
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,400
And then I realized,no...

665
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,820
that's why you took the job.

666
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,760
yeah,he's right,you know.Boyer.

667
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,820
"A case like this one,
it's the reason I hate being a cop."

668
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,590
It's also the reason I am one.

669
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,940
well,that's the hour.

670
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,810
I thought we just got started.

671
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,940
Yeah.How would next thursday at 3:30 be?

672
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,920
Oh. No,I'm serious.
What do we have,eight more hours?

673
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,170
You know,I've got stuff to do tonight,
but I'm just down the block,

674
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,830
if you don't mind watching me exfoliate...

675
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,590
3:30 next thursday.

676
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,140
Yeah. Okay. Got me gabbing there.

677
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,140
- Detective?
- Yeah.

678
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,690
When we talked earlier today,you said
you couldn't get the little girl out of your head.

679
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,130
Did you see her?

680
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,550
I'm sorry,what?

681
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,820
Emily.

682
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,550
Did you actually see her?

683
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,940
You said that you talk to the victims.

684
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,760
Do you see them as well?

685
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,680
No. I don'T.

686
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,420
Okay.

687
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,270
Bourbon on a tuesday night?

688
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,300
Better than tuesday morning.

689
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,370
Why are you still here?

690
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,190
- I want you to play the song.
- No.

691
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,810
Please?

692
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,880
Maybe you should have that drink.

693
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Look,I'm sorry about your dad.

694
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,560
It's okay. Really.

695
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,110
I know you had to do it.

696
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,810
That it was the right thing.

697
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,840
Then why haven't you left yet?

698
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,390
It isn't just the song...

699
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,860
"because I think you should talk to
that doctor lady some more and tell her the truth."

700
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,620
You do,huh?

701
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,200
I could lose my job.

702
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,950
So?

703
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,360
It's all I've got,honey.

704
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,330
"I think if you don't talk to her,
you're gonna lose it anyway."

705
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:36,300
- I think you should mind
- I'm ten.I don't say beeswax anymore.

706
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,840
If I play it,will you go?

707
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,230
You know,I hate this song.
