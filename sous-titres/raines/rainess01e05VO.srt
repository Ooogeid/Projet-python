1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,070
So nice that maybe you're
feeling a little vulnerable?

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,270
Exposed to the elements, a
tent in some dangerous woods.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,180
So what do you do?

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,720
You buy a gun.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,200
What better way to
protect your castle, right?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,310
You buy a gun, and you keep
it loaded somewhere close by.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,270
And you go to sleep at night
feeling secure that hey,

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,780
anybody wants to break
into my house, I'll,

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,940
you know, bust a cap in
their asses or something.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,510
Whatever.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,930
But then you get in the moment,

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,160
and you're faced with
actually shooting this person,

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,270
this interloper in your home.

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,430
And the gun's shaking in your hands.

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,010
And you're really gonna
do this thing. Really.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,040
And bam, just like that,
they take your gun away.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,350
And then they shoot you with it.

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,160
Because a: They're not quite as circumspect as you
when it comes to the vagaries of human existence.

19
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,080
And then you're this,

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,160
this nice lady dead on the
coffee table with no head.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,870
(Boyer) shotgun casings
looks like a 20 gauge.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,280
Smaller bore. Less recoil.

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,660
Homedefense for the modern woman.

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,610
Still makes a hell of a mess.

25
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,410
Hey, boyer, you might
wanna watch your step there.

26
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,010
Yeah, let's try to avoid tracking bits of the
victim all over her living room, okay, everybody?

27
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,640
Man, she is everywhere.

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,020
Vic's connie webb,
34. Her husband is--

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,010
lionel webb. I know him.

30
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,770
L. A. Criminal judge. Best there is.

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,560
(Boyer) that guy hates me.
Every time I'm in his courtroom,

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,570
he dings me for some little procedural
thing, makes me look like a jerk.

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,810
Remi boyer missing a procedural beat? I'm
shocked. I have to lay down. I'm dizzy.

34
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,440
Yeah, joke it up just
'cause you two are homeboys.

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,240
That time he ruled against you, you
were in a crap mood for weeks after that.

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,220
I was irritated because of
the ruling. He was right.

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,600
Did I seriously just hear
you refer to us as homeboys?

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,500
Anyway, webb came home from the
golf trip, found her like this,

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,780
confirms the shotgun he bought
for home defense is missing.

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,370
Mossberg persuader,
pump action 20 gauge.

41
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,540
So she hears someone milling
around downstairs, grabs the shotty.

42
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,250
He takes it, pops her.

43
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,450
Gets spooked and bails?

44
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,140
(Lance) forced entry on the kitchen window,
looking for drugs maybe, pharmaceuticals,

45
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,510
(raines) maybe.

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,030
Oh!

47
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,890
A little art project. Must not
have been in too big a hurry.

48
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,610
(Boyer) 1488, what's that, like, a date?

49
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,660
White supremacist code. 14 is the
first 14 words of the aryan credo.

50
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,110
"We must secure the existence of our
people and the future of white children.

51
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,550
" (Raines) catchy, isn't it?

52
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,340
And the 88?

53
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,980
Eighth letter of the
alphabet. Twice h H.

54
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,980
H, h?

55
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,310
Hugh... hefner!

56
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,220
Heil, hitler, boyer.

57
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,540
Excuse me for noticing,
she happens to be white.

58
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,880
Her husband just sentenced the leader of
a aryan brotherhood to life in pelican bay,

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,480
contract hits. Trying
to start a race war.

60
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,520
So what, someone comes to hit the
judge, slipped up, got the wife instead?

61
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,640
Maybe. Or a signal for the troops.

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,700
If this is the first shot of a race war,

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,560
better put on a smock.

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,590
It's gonna get a whole lot bloodier.

68
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,280
He stood up in the stand and
condemned us to death, michael.

69
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,390
Called me a race traitor.

70
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,820
Pawn of the
zionist-occupied government.

71
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,660
You didn't think he'd make good on it?

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,270
You know how it is.

73
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,490
If trial judges circle the wagons every time somebody
threatens us, we would never get anything done.

74
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,710
And I'd heard it all before,

75
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,650
but levay,

76
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,680
he was like a trapped animal.

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,420
Clawing and spitting.

78
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,610
It was crazy.

79
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,810
Yeah, michael, I worried about it.

80
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,700
And that's why you bought the shotgun?

81
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,130
Yes...

82
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,620
oh, god! Connie.

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,610
I never should have
left her alone, michael.

84
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,270
Wish you'd gotten a chance to meet her.

85
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,390
She was just fearless.

86
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,690
Never even blinked.

87
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,850
Told me not to worry about her,
she could take care of herself.

88
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,000
She insisted that I stick to my guns.

89
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,660
She believed in me, michael.

90
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,900
Michael...

91
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,380
levay took away the only
woman I will ever love.

92
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,590
I want that son of a bitch
to die for what he did.

93
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,570
Do you understand me?

94
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,460
Yeah, I know.

95
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,660
Is it possible, do you have a picture
of-- that I could see of connie?

96
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,810
It would help me know
better who she was.

97
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,620
Yeah.

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,980
You, okay?

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,400
Yeah, it's my back.

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
Car accident last spring.

101
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,640
Never really heals.

102
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,420
The stress.

103
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,420
You know, we shoulda had
you over for dinner, michael.

104
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,830
We always talked about it. It just seemed
like there would always be time, you know?

105
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,560
She woulda liked you.

106
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,550
(Connie) this is a much better
look for me, don't you think?

107
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,460
Any image of you where you still have a
head is a good one as far as I'm concerned.

108
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,400
The picture was old. I'm
surprised this thing still fits.

109
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,790
But it looks okay, right?

110
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,000
Sheriff's department knew about the
threats. They were responsible for security.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,910
They could have posted a car.

112
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,920
You know it doesn't
work that way, michael.

113
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,050
Can't protect everyone all the time.

114
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,760
These people are animals.
You can't show fear.

115
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,310
Besides, you know how lionel is.

116
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,380
Tough judge.

117
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,500
You said it.

118
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,230
So you were caught in the crossfire of
a war that you had nothing to do with.

119
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,580
It certainly seems that way, doesn't it?

120
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,240
Okay, the press was in love with
webb over the aryan brotherhood trial,

121
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,940
so I don't need to tell you that
they're all over this. What do we got?

122
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,240
(Boyer) we've got no
prints. No hairs, no fibers.

123
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
The shooter used the
victim's gun in the hit.

124
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,260
And then took it with, so no ballistics.

125
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,490
We don't know this was a hit yet.

126
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,840
(Boyer) sure looks like a hit, cap.

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,880
Yeah, okay, tell me
about this levay idiot?

128
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,980
Jerome bryant levay, 33 years old,

129
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,280
in and out of the prison
system since he was 15.

130
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,760
Assault, theft,
conspiracy murder, arson,

131
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,190
hate crime statutes.

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,140
He's at twin towers pending
transfer to the shu at pelican bay.

133
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,390
Okay, would he have
enough juice to pull a hit?

134
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,180
From behind bars this quickly?

135
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,210
The fed cracked down on brand leaders,
left a power vacuum at the higher level,

136
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,850
so levay might be stepping up.

137
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,920
It could be a power
play, show he's the man.

138
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,960
To get the shooter to roll on levay,

139
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,720
we're gonna have to offer
something up in return.

140
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,190
These guys don't do nothing for free.

141
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,470
We have to find the shooter
first, but thank you, boyer.

142
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,750
Let's work the aryan
angle as a priority.

143
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,280
Keep your eyes open
for other possibilities.

144
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,060
I'm gonna go talk to levay.

145
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,460
You really think you could
get anything out of this guy?

146
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,260
I have my charms. Five minutes, I'll
have this guy eating out of my hand.

147
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,820
I am gonna kill you, you zionist bitch!

148
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,640
Just like I killed that whore!

149
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,100
Beg me for mercy!

150
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,470
Beg me now, pig!

151
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,430
You mentioned that a few times already.
And maybe later, for the begging.

152
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,780
Um, but first help me get this straight,

153
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,320
you ordered a hit on the
judge's wife as a call to arms?

154
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,800
A wake-up call for my aryan brothers!

155
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,910
That was just the beginning.

156
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,110
The war is on now, pigs!

157
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,420
Let the mud races behold the
gathering storm and tremble!

158
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,940
Aah!

159
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,240
Come on!

160
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,530
[Grunting] (Connie) that went well.

161
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,720
I didn't exactly expect the
guy to roll over and confess.

162
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,340
Well, it's a good thing.

163
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,400
It's called detective
work. I'm detecting.

164
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,690
So?

165
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,150
Did he kill me or not?

166
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,900
I couldn't tell whether that
guy was just jerking me around

167
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,870
or whether he's really
that far off his nut.

168
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,930
Either way no confession of
his is gonna stand up in court.

169
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,730
So what do we do now?

170
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,060
Start with known associates-- other
aryans who had a beef with your husband.

171
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,030
'Cause it's all about him, right?

172
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,820
Somebody wants to get back
at him, so they come after me.

173
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,850
It happens.

174
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,850
But why did it happen to me?

175
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,810
Killing a judge is one thing,

176
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,400
but coming after his family,

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,830
that makes a statement:
"We're not playing games.

178
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,400
" [Cell phone rings] Yeah.

179
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,030
Yes!

180
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,640
Good news?

181
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,570
Lewis thinks that he may
have found your shooter.

182
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,290
They're in contingent,
holed up near oakwood.

183
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,250
Derelict building being
used as a clubhouse.

184
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,340
Clubhouse, wow. They
have a secret handshake?

185
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,700
I don't know, maybe you can ask them
that after you smash down their door.

186
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,340
Why do we like these
guys for the shooters?

187
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,850
Neighborhood tipster called in saying
one of them got belligerent drunk,

188
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,150
started waving around a shiny new
shotgun showing it off to the boys.

189
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,740
How many inside?

190
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,980
Possibly four. Could be as many as six.

191
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,100
With shotguns?

192
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,190
You sure this isn't a
S. W. A. T. Call, cap?

193
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,370
S. W. A. T. 'S gonna stand by on the
perimeter in case things get ugly, boyer,

194
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,090
but I want a small team making entry

195
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,140
because I don't want this
thing to turn into waco 2, okay?

196
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,090
Yes, sir.

197
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,940
Don't worry, boyer. I'll protect you.

198
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,630
[Girlie laugh] Let's move
before this guy vanishes.

199
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,550
Police! Don't move!

200
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,860
We're clear!

201
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,050
I got the runners. Place is clear.

202
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,020
I think the shot caller's
the one with the mustache.

203
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,970
Weapons?

204
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,900
One of them had a stiletto. No guns yet.

205
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,230
(Raines) keep lookin'.

206
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,390
Hey, I think I found the basement. [Cocks gun]
[Groans] [Screaming in pain] Where does it hurt ?

207
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,260
Which one of you killed connie webb?

208
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,720
Was it your buddy?

209
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,830
Maybe it was one of your soldiers, a
shame we had to put so many bullets in him.

210
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,310
Because now if he dies,

211
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,980
it all becomes about you, right?

212
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,610
My brother's gonna die?

213
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,890
Wait a minute. Brother-brother?

214
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,640
Or like a white-power brother?

215
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,040
Is he okay or not?

216
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll tell you what,

217
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,290
you tell me something that
doesn't totally waste my time,

218
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,250
and then I'll give you some
information about your brother.

219
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,490
He didn't kill me.

220
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,900
Shh!

221
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,240
What?

222
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,110

Shh--shh.

223
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,680
I wanna know who took the order
from levay on the webb hit?

224
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,440
If you think anybody anywhere's
taking orders from levay,

225
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,470
you're as delusional as he is.

226
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,950
Guy's a nut job.

227
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,550
Got all crazy religious with it.

228
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,020
He's a joke.

229
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,390
He didn't kill that bitch. And
nobody killed on his mandate, okay?

230
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,840
Hey!

231
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,220
What about my brother?

232
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,610
Well,

233
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,030
you've still got other family, right?

234
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,100
(Raines) lance, you okay?

235
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,610
No, yeah. I'm fine.

236
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,370
You don't have to be here, you know?

237
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,400
You could take a day or two.

238
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,310
I'm okay.

239
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,220
(Boyer) yo! What's up, deadeye?
One for the asian assassin.

240
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,250
Boyer.

241
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,240
(Boyer) yeah?

242
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,110
Boyer!

243
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,990
First one.

244
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,320
Boyer!

245
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,610
The next time you clear a
room, do me a favor, okay?

246
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,600
Make sure the room is actually clear.

247
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,970
Now I gotta deal with the ada, fid, iad,

248
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,130
props and standards, the
media, and lewis, why?

249
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,940
Because somebody didn't
bother to peek in a closet.

250
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,510
Bear claw?

251
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,260
Oh,

252
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,290
the biker's alibis check out for
the night of the webb shooting.

253
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,700
Drunk tank, culver city.

254
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,320
And also the biker's shotgun was a 12-gauge,
doesn't match our shooter's 20, so...

255
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,630
(lance) boyer!

256
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,150
- Yeah?
- Boyer!

257
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,270
What about the guy I shot?

258
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,720
He's critical, but stable. Memorial.

259
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,270
The bullet perfed the
intestines. He's septic.

260
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,180
It'll be a nasty recovery.

261
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,800
[Laughs] Which is good.

262
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,640
Come on. Buy you a doughnut.

263
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,250
That's fresh brewed.

264
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,830
Hey, your friend's holding
another press conference.

265
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,400
(Lionel) I know my wife would insist
that I continue my quest for justice.

266
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,890
I believe that I can best uphold her legacy by
persevering in my drive for a safe los angeles.

267
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,860
This tragedy has instilled
in me a renewed conviction...

268
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,520
his wife's murder's not
slowing him down much, is it?

269
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,880
To rid our streets of
those who would terrorize us

270
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,710
and abuse the freedoms
that are granted to us.

271
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,060
My wife, she would want that.

272
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,160
She would demand justice.

273
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,740
Fair, blind, and unrelenting.

274
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,610
The outgoing of sympathy
and support has been,

275
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,150
um, overwhelming.

276
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,390
(Connie) so who are you gonna believe?

277
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,280
What do you mean?

278
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,820
Well, you've got one guy practically
desperate to take the credit for killing me,

279
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,300
and another who says there's no way.

280
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,620
Only one of them can be right.

281
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,930
Yeah, both choices putrid. I'm
gonna have to go with marcus.

282
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,530
Why?

283
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,650
Why, why?

284
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,140
Because marcus has nothing
to gain by protecting levay.

285
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,650
It's not ideological for him.

286
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,930
And because levay does come
up as a major, major loon.

287
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,910
Well, you would know.

288
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,340
Also, everybody saw levay
from the stand ranting.

289
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,520
The real killer could just point to the
scary nazi. It's the perfect deflection.

290
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,090
The tv, what were you doing
at the press conference?

291
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,630
I supported my husband. Stood by him.

292
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,710
Trusted him.

293
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,140
Yeah, that's exactly
what he told me about you.

294
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,060
Everything I know about
you I got from lionel.

295
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,470
But that isn't necessarily me, is it?

296
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,770
The way this works is I'm supposed to
pick up on things you let slip, right?

297
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,120
So what's slipping, michael?

298
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,830
What if it's something else?

299
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,110
I'm listening.

300
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,810
Lionel is my friend.

301
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,600
Maybe it just shouldn't be so
much who was trying to hurt him,

302
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,110
but who wanted to kill you.

303
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,830
Carolyn? Yeah.

304
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,600
I need everything on the
vic first thing tomorrow.

305
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,110
No, not the husband. Connie webb.

306
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,990
The personal history, phone records,
school records, everything. Yeah, thanks.

307
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,630
What were you doing that
could have gotten you killed?

308
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,390
You sure you won't join me, michael?

309
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,390
Hmm, no thank you.

310
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,890
I'm still working.

311
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,010
What can I tell you about connie?

312
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,360
Well, you know,

313
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,000
just--just-- just trying to
get a better picture of her.

314
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,990
So now I'm not a good
enough picture for you?

315
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,590
She was 24 when I first met her.

316
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,780
She was a witness in a
drug case I was prosecuting.

317
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,250
I took one long look at her,

318
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,650
and I just knew, you know what I mean?

319
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,040
She had some problems of her own,

320
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,480
you know, not such a great
family life growing up.

321
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,990
She acted like she didn't
care what happened to her.

322
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,110
Live fast, all that.

323
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,160
Intoxicating really.

324
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,040
I helped her get her
priorities straight.

325
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,390
Watched her change herself,

326
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,470
gain some pride in who she was.

327
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,220
Then you married her?

328
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,510
Life can get too perfect, michael.

329
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,350
You can have too much.

330
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,290
Be too happy.

331
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,310
And then god finds out about
it and snatches it all away.

332
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,340
You know what I mean?

333
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,530
Carolyn, what do you got?

334
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,930
Uh, connie webb, no job, no kids,

335
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,880
did her time at social functions,
smiled, not too opinionated.

336
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,050
Generally thought of as...

337
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,920
wait for it... nice.

338
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,370
Nice I can't use. Uh, disturbed,
sociopath, mean to old ladies,

339
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,820
that's useful, and anything
the husband didn't know.

340
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,120
There was this one thing.

341
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,400
Thing? Give me the thing. I know.

342
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,870
She opened up an account at first navy credit
union three months ago under her maiden name.

343
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,430
Doesn't sound sordid.
Cell phone records?

344
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes, a lot of calls to
two different numbers.

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,290
One to a mitchell parks who
owns a salon in west hollywood.

346
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,740
- The other is an unknown anonymous cell.
- Anonymous? I like that.

347
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,200
But it's a
pay-as-you-go plan.

348
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,860
It's awfully hard to trace
unless you do a lot of digging.

349
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,560
Have lance start to do the digging.

350
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,450
Ah, you got an address
on mitchell parks?

351
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,450
See-ah!

352
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,220
Right, I need all sili numbers sold for 
cell phones at that store within the last year.

353
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,950
Yes, all of them.

354
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,950
Right, uh-huh. Yeah, I'll hold.

355
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,400
Gun!

356
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,060
(Boyer) dexter, where'd you steal this?

357
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,970
I'm sorry. I can't help it. It's shiny.

358
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,400
He probably pulled it
off one of the desks.

359
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,630
Oh, god.

360
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,020
You really thought that was a gun?

361
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,620
Yeah, I thought it was a gun.
That's pretty much why I yelled "gun!

362
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,730
" At the top of my voice.

363
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,980
You do have some serious
lungs. You really--you know--

364
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,770
[Imitates lance screaming] It's not funny. I just
drilled that guy in front of the entire division.

365
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,640
Over a stapler.

366
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,310
It's normal.

367
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,450
I mean, you shot somebody.
It's not, like, an easy thing.

368
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,760
Hey, boyer, boyer, boyer. Boyer, please.

369
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,920
The last thing that I need right
now is sympathy from you, okay?

370
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,270
You're standing in front
of the coffee machine.

371
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,240
But don't shoot me
for pointing that out.

372
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,530
Yeah, that's more like it.

373
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,170
[Laughter] Scared me for a minute there.

374
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,710
I loved connie.

375
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,560
Define loved.

376
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,590
Adored, worshipped, idolized, trusted.

377
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,870
Slept with?

378
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,310
Sadly, no.

379
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,880
The whole time I knew
her with the husband,

380
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,680
it was always with the
depression, the moping.

381
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,690
Her hair's dull and lifeless.

382
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,790
It's pretty unbearable, really.

383
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,440
Then about three months ago, all
of a sudden, she's like a new woman.

384
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,110
Happy. Glowing.

385
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,400
Wow, what changed?

386
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,440
She started showing up with this woman.

387
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,080
Wait a minute.

388
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,510
What are you saying?

389
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,810
I'm saying these two had
something beautiful going on.

390
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,250
Something I'd like to have a video of.

391
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,340
Wait, hold on. I got a
picture somewhere around here.

392
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,920
I shoot everyone who comes
in, you know, before and after.

393
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,690
Where is it?

394
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,190
Check it out. This is her.

395
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,020
She never told me exactly
what they had going on,

396
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,140
but my instincts are pretty
keen when it comes to this stuff.

397
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,550
A little more time I
mighta gotten in there.

398
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,570
It's hard to say.

399
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,640
Really?

400
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,770
My life is strange and wonderful, man.

401
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,690
Congratulations.

402
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,060
Can you imagine?

403
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,990
Um...

404
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,930
yeah, I can imagine.

405
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,590
(Lionel) if any of this
gets out, I'm finished.

406
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,880
Okay... but I need to-- I
need to know what's gong on.

407
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,160
I knew it was a mistake.

408
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,220
You hear words like discreet,
and you wanna believe them.

409
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,200
How did they meet?

410
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,860
Connie and I had been
married for about nine years.

411
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,410
It was just starting to get a
little predictable. You know?

412
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,630
She was young. I wanted
to keep her interested.

413
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,330
She had talked about, um...

414
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,510
another party being
brought into the picture.

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,540
I thought,

416
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,260
And she seemed receptive.

417
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,860
Once you get that idea in your
head, it's hard to get it out.

418
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,850
Tell me about it.

419
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,690
No, I mean, tell me about it.

420
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,300
We called an escort service.

421
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,980
And they sent over this, um,

422
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,070
person that you're talking about.

423
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,660
We had her over a few times.

424
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,990
It was interesting, as
you can well imagine,

425
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,720
but it didn't feel right, and
after a while we stopped doing it.

426
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,910
The same woman every time?

427
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,760
Yes.

428
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,110
What happened?

429
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,810
After a few times, we
called it off. That was it.

430
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,940
I need to know who she was.

431
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,150
I need to know her name.

432
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,670
I don't know it.

433
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,860
I got rid of all that, anything that
could tie us to that experience-- lionel.

434
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,760
For god's sakes, michael, the man who
killed my wife is out there right now.

435
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,690
I have to explore all possibilities.

436
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,190
That's my job.

437
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,190
I have to go to court.

438
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,900
One deceased victim's red-hot
lesbian lover, right this way.

439
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,540
Uh, you found her? How'd you do that?

440
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,840
Redialed her phone for six hours till
she pretty much couldn't take it anymore.

441
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,310
Guaranteed results. Just ask my ex.

442
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,830
Uh, where is she?

443
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,510
In lewis' office.

444
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,790
Did you just primp?

445
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,680
What?

446
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,140
You primped just now, didn't you?

447
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,410
No, I don't think I did.
Why, do I not look that good?

448
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,760
Men are idiots here.

449
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,790
What?

450
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,150
It's okay, raines.

451
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,950
I'm sure she's just been waiting for the right
man to show her the glory of switching teams.

452
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,520
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

453
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,460
Svetlana zhdanov.

454
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,990
Did I pronounce that correctly?

455
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,250
I've heard it said worse.

456
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,040
Say, t-the, uh, indoor
recreational smoking,

457
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,840
I'm afraid not. I'm gonna have
to-- I'll take that from you.

458
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,800
[Chuckles] Police make me uncomfortable.

459
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,120
Do they really?

460
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,440
Your woman detective,

461
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,060
Well, we're hoping that you can
help us with a murder investigation.

462
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,850
That's why we tend to be annoying.

463
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,550
And how can I help
you, detective raines?

464
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,570
Detective?

465
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,720
Connie webb,

466
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,450
um, two nights ago in
her home was murdered.

467
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,340
I heard about this.

468
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,440
It is very tragic.

469
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,820
We have witness information
that you and connie were,

470
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,520
uh, close.

471
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,130
How do you mean this "close?

472
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,260
" You were lovers, svetlana.

473
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,000
Detective raines,
friends, yes. Lovers, no.

474
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,710
Our relationship was of
entirely different nature.

475
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,420
What is the exact nature
of your relationship?

476
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,250
I was sponsor.

477
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,270
(Raines) sponsor?

478
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,420
Connie webb was drug addict in
recovery. I was sponsor. You see?

479
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,480
(Raines) yeah.

480
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,970
I, uh, I see.

481
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,000
you were connie's sponsor?

482
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,450
She was heavy user.

483
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,190
Cocaine, yes? Um-hmm.

484
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,480
Alcohol. Amphetamines, pills...

485
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,980
uh, her husband, the judge,

486
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,340
told me about the three of you
and your little transaction?

487
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,150
Business is business.

488
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,090
That is not same thing as love.

489
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,560
Uh-huh.

490
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,680
So you're what, a call girl?

491
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,200
I am sex worker.

492
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,530
I make no apologies for
this. It is not my choice.

493
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,290
I'm not condemning you for it.

494
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:58,020
I'm just trying to understand
your relationship with connie webb.

495
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,160
Cigarette, please.

496
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,880
I was contacted to have
date with them as couple.

497
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,550
He likes to watch. You understand?

498
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,090
So I go back again several more times.

499
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,020
One time she offers me drugs to take.

500
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,190
Says it helps for her to get
in mood for what he wanted.

501
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,650
I tell her I'm not interested.

502
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,700
I am having birthday, yes?

503
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,410
(Raines) birthday?

504
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,260
Sober birthday.

505
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,480
I am clean and sober 464 days.

506
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,880
Congratulations on everything.

507
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,010
So the next time I come over she
tells me that she wants to stop using.

508
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,170
I tell her I can help
her if she's serious.

509
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,030
I invite her to come to meeting with me.

510
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,720
We become friends.

511
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,570
She is honest about her problem.

512
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,000
Tells me her story.

513
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,990
She would have 90 days
when she was killed.

514
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,660
She would get chip,

515
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,770
share her story about
how she accomplished this.

516
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,220
How did you do this?

517
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,850
Is is hard, but she is
becoming very, very happy.

518
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,580
She's feeling freedom.

519
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,530
She says she wants to help me pay off
my debt to those who bring me here,

520
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,900
so I can feel freedom too.

521
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,780
But that is not going to happen, is it?

522
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,900
(Connie) disappointed much?

523
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,210
(Raines) no, no, those sponsor-addict
relationships with all that sincerity, very sexy.

524
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,960
But it isn't what got me killed.

525
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,540
Well, I can't prove
anything. Forensics are kaput.

526
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,640
Whoever did this was a pro.

527
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,410
And your husband, he didn't have that much to lose by
you just being in the program that he'd have done you in.

528
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:52,300
Unless there was something about
ya that was particularly bothersome.

529
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,990
Is there?

530
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,580
You have your moments.

531
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,280
Did he think so?

532
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,150
No, no, I think he was in love with you.

533
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,890
You know, he sure knew about your
past, so your using was no big surprise.

534
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,900
Maybe I disappointed him.

535
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,970
Let him down.

536
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,280
He had to take steps
to correct my behavior.

537
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,120
You were working the
steps with svetlana.

538
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,050
"We admitted that we were
powerless over drugs and alcohol,

539
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,530
that our lives had become unmanageable.

540
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,590
" Look, just because he couldn't
pass a bar without walking in,

541
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,160
doesn't
mean that--

542
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,220
that he couldn't?

543
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,840
Pass the bar.

544
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,230
You walk into my courtroom
unprepared like this,

545
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,480
so help me god I'll slap you
both with so many sanctions,

546
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
you'll swear it's
raining contempt in here!

547
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,530
You understand me?

548
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,410
Sorry to interrupt.

549
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,580
Detective raines, is it not painfully
obvious I'm in the middle of something here?

550
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,510
This can't wait.

551
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,670
(Raines) for a friend?

552
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,040
Nice tie.

553
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,240
You're going to have to excuse me.

554
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,980
Michael,

555
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,010
Connie had a drug problem.

556
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,790
But she was in recovery.

557
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,630
And the woman that you brought into
your relationship was her sponsor.

558
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,300
Ain't that right?

559
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,470
That had nothing to do
with her death, michael.

560
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,640
My god, you saw what they
did to her. That was revenge!

561
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,350
She wasn't killed for revenge.
She was killed to keep a secret.

562
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,650
That's ridiculous!
I don't--

563
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,490
I've known more than my
share of people in recovery.

564
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,470
Cops, you know, no shortage
of addiction problems.

565
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,130
So consider this an intervention.

566
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,340
I got to thinking about the 12 steps.

567
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,100
And in recovery the way to help
yourself is to tell your story.

568
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,550
So I'm gonna now tell you my story.

569
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,240
I want you off this case, michael!
I'm calling daniel right now.

570
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,210
I know a thing or two about
secrets because I got one of my own.

571
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,080
And if anybody found out about my
secret, they could boot me off the force,

572
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,700
take away my gun, everything that I
am, but I don't care about that now.

573
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,750
Not if talking about my problem's
gonna help you with yours.

574
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,570
I see people...

575
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,780
who aren't there.

576
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,190
I see the victims of the
crimes that I'm investigating.

577
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,410
Right now in that chair, I
see your wife. I see connie.

578
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,440
She's counting on me to
bring her killer to justice.

579
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,790
She's not gonna leave
me alone till I do,

580
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,140
so you can see where I'm kind
of motivated to get it right.

581
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,900
- Michael
- she's not a ghost.

582
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,650
She's in my head, which pretty
much makes me certifiable.

583
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,140
So I gotta cover for
that secret every day.

584
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,420
So far I've done okay.

585
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,550
I solve a case, they go. We make a deal.

586
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:41,670
How far would you go to keep a
secret? Would you kill for it?

587
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,840
What in the hell are you talking about?

588
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,420
That first time I came to see you,
you were in pain. It was your back.

589
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,090
You were talking about
your car accident.

590
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,500
Then the next time I came over,
your eyes were sunken and dilated.

591
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,850
You were stumbling all around.

592
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,690
My wife was murdered in my
home, michael. I was in shock.

593
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,910
And what better way to deal
with shock than pills and booze?

594
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,480
You said it yourself, you're crazy!

595
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,990
If I didn't believe it before, I do now.

596
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,710
Law school 1986, you blew through a red
light in berkeley after an orientation.

597
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,220
You got popped with a dui.

598
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,370
That was 20 years ago.

599
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,500
You're a party guy. Everybody knew it.

600
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,060
Everybody I talked to last night anyway.

601
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,530
So much so that in order to pass the bar,
you had to prove that you were in recovery,

602
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,180
so you did the 12 steps.

603
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,450
You passed the bar with flying colors.

604
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,850
Got your job in the da's office.
Worked your way up to the bench.

605
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,240
Clean and sober.

606
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,150
You're married now, so you
get connie into a program.

607
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,000
Help her through it one day at a time.

608
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,460
Until the car accident.

609
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,550
And then your back gets really so horribly
tweaked that you gotta be on those pain meds.

610
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,610
It's not an uncommon way
for addicts to fall off,

611
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,890
but once you're on the pills, you think,

612
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,760
"say, what's a little drinking gonna do?

613
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,730
" And then no more recovery. All
those chips, all that time put in,

614
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,660
gone, gone.

615
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,320
Now you're using like crazy.

616
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,910
You bring connie back down with ya.

617
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,220
You're making questionable decisions, like
bringing other parties into the relationship,

618
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,450
whereby connie meets svetlana.

619
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,390
And with her help she starts
cleaning herself up again.

620
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,920
But you, you think, "I can
be high and still function.

621
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,240
" It's different now. I'm
running the bench like this.

622
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,470
But you're lying to
yourself. You're in denial.

623
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,160
And worst of all, paranoid.

624
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,010
"Connie, she's gonna tell
svetlana about my problem.

625
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,490
" What's that fifth step?

626
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,850
We admit to ourselves, to god,

627
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,560
and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs.

628
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,520
And god only knows who all a
russian hooker's gonna tell.

629
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,750
If any of this gets out, I'm finished.

630
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,090
We've got to get rid of her.

631
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,480
" [Lionel crying] (Raines) this is your moment of
clarity. Your life has officially become unmanageable.

632
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,010
Look at that picture. That's your wife.

633
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,440
Somebody blew her head off with a
shotgun on your orders in your house.

634
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,710
Look at that.

635
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,470
No! No! You're wrong!

636
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,620
I-I-I wo-- I
couldn't hurt her.

637
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,260
I could never hurt her.

638
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,280
Then tell me who did?

639
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,410
I don't know!

640
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,230
Yes you do, no more secrets!

641
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,450
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

642
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,910
It was anonymous!

643
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,670
I never saw his face.

644
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,750
It was just a money drop.

645
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,330
And I told him to make
it look like aryans.

646
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,430
[Lionel continues sobbing] And once
it got started, I couldn't stop it!

647
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,770
I tried! I tried!

648
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,120
I begged them, michael!

649
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,790
But it was too late.

650
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,460
You gotta understand,
michael, this wasn't about me!

651
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,250
This wasn't about being disbarred.

652
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,310
It was about two years of decisions
that could have been overturned.

653
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,300
It was about two years of decisions
that I made while I was high!

654
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,380
I put away murderers, rapists,

655
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,260
the most depraved scum
society has to endure.

656
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,860
What if all those convictions
were overturned, over this?

657
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,960
All those animals back
out on the streets!

658
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,030
Don't you understand,
this wasn't about me!

659
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,050
This was about justice!

660
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,060
I've worked my whole life for it.

661
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,560
Doesn't that supersede the rest?
Isn't that what we're here for?

662
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,830
You hired a hit man to
kill your wife over justice?

663
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,860
This beautiful, vibrant woman who you
loved so much, who loved you so much,

664
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,060
and that's the lie that
you're telling to yourself?

665
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,260
The hooker woulda told! Michael,
she would have! I know it!

666
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,210
It had to be stopped! This
was the only way! Please!

667
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,930
Connie never told anybody! Svetlana, I
don't think even knew. Your secret was safe.

668
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,620
What the hell were you thinking?

669
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,530
Oh, god! Svetlana!

670
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,900
I've killed them both. What have I done?

671
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,180
What? What do you mean "them both?

672
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,030
" I gave them two names.

673
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,330
My wife'S...

674
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,040
and svetlana'S.

675
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,630
Lance, uh, right now, grab svetlana.

676
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,930
Put her into protective
custody. Cordon off her place.

677
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,730
Put it under surveillance.

678
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,940
I think somebody might be...

679
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,220
[Impact] Trying to kill her.

680
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,670
Go!

681
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,140
[Police sirens wailing] (Raines)
what do you mean no answer?

682
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,270
I've been trying.

683
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,770
Svetlana's not answering
either at home or on her cell.

684
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,480
What's the 20 on black
and whites inbound?

685
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,540
Code six at the scene. Possible
movement inside the location.

686
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,720
I'm two minutes out. Have S. E. G.

687
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,840
Secure a two-block perimeter
and hold till I get there. Okay?

688
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,440
(Carolyn) you got it.

689
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,750
[Police sirens wailing] Bedroom's clear.

690
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:05,880
NSNNITY: DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND
OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS.

691
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,620
Yeah, it's cleared here.

692
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,000
It's true, you know?

693
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,330
Raines, she's not here. It's clear.

694
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,050
Did you check the closet?

695
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,950
I did. Nobody's here.

696
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,060
[Child crying] Hi, what's
the matter? What happened?

697
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,470
He--he took--
he took my mom.

698
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,560
Who, who? Who took your mom?

699
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,860
The man.

700
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,040
He took her away.

701
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,530
Away? Where'd he take her?

702
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,860
He said to get him past the police.

703
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,490
He had a gun.

704
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,720
Please. Please, don't hurt me.

705
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,370
Shut up! Stop crying!

706
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,820
Okay, okay. Get me past the cops
or I swear to god, I'll kill you.

707
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,450
Okay. Can I see some I. D. , Ma'am?

708
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,060
I'm just going to vons.
I forgot something stupid.

709
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,570
Really.

710
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,540
You drive safely, ma'am.

711
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,940
My son, he's at home. He's scared.

712
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,070
- Shut up!
- He's alone.

713
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,200
- Please, would you just
let me-- shut your mouth.

714
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,010
[Woman screams] Help! Help!

715
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,790
Get me out!

716
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,360
Jim, give me a knife!

717
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,230
Pull her out! Pull
her out! Pull her out!

718
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,860
Help me! Get me out!

719
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,450
Cover him!

720
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,710
Whoa!

721
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,300
[Cell phone rings] Yeah.

722
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,470
(Carolyn) we got her. She's here.

723
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,640
Put her on.

724
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,520
(Svetlana) detective
raines, what is happening?

725
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,490
Svetlana?

726
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,220
What is this protective custody?

727
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,380
We've been going crazy trying to
get a hold of you. Where you been?

728
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,970
What? I was at meeting.

729
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,420
Lionel was right.

730
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,130
We should have had you over for dinner.

731
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,120
Always seems like there's gonna
be time for that kind of thing.

732
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,590
And just like that,
there's no more time.

733
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,370
It's all over and I'm gone forever.

734
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,090
Hey, this thing I do
in my... in my head.

735
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,510
You know, with you...

736
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,970
it was almost kinda nice having
you around. You know what I mean?

737
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,670
You'll always be your
own best company, michael.

738
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,490
I'm just your imagination.

739
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,850
You know that. But still, thanks anyway.

740
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,450
Raines!

741
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,410
(Raines) one minute.

742
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,740
Each time you pull the trigger,
every round you fire into a person,

743
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,660
it takes a little bit out of ya,

744
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,710
a little piece of yourself
that you never get back.

745
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,280
You shoot somebody,

746
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,030
even if they had it coming,

747
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,910
it's not a natural thing
to do. It has consequences.

748
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,030
I don't feel bad about
shooting the guy, raines.

749
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,370
Well, good, you shouldn't, especially
since he was gunning for me,

750
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,200
which by the way is why
you're drinking free tonight.

751
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,100
I fired three times. 12 feet away,
center mass, just like I was taught.

752
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,800
And I hit him once. Once,
raines. That pisses me off.

753
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,260
You're mad 'cause you
didn't kill the guy?

754
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,500
The perception is that female officers
are more prone to shoot than men

755
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,130
because they don't have the physical
strength to get the job done any other way.

756
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,170
I just don't like the stereotype the
little korean girl couldn't take the heat.

757
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,200
This is how it works.

758
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,160
What? How what works?

759
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,630
The consequences.

760
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,720
It hits you in ways that
you never see coming.

761
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,050
Makes you question your judgment,
your ability to do the job.

762
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,250
You do your job, and little
by little, it gets better.

763
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,450
So it goes away?

764
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,780
Yeah, it goes away.

765
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,110
You wake up one morning,

766
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,300
and once again you're
normal as blueberry pie.

767
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,530
Everything's ducky.

768
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,420
Just keep doing your job, lance.

769
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,610
[Glasses clinking] Hey, raines...

770
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,650
my man.

771
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,750
One face you wear for
the people you know,

772
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,540
the other just for yourself, right?

773
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,110
A toast to the detective.

774
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,070
To justice, whatever the price.

775
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,690
Secrets well-kept.
