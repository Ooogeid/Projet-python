1
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:05,401
Maybe I read too many
detective books when I was a kid.

2
00:00:05,518 --> 00:00:07,246
Chandler, Hammett, Macdonald,

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,695
all the great California guys
of the '40s and '50s.

4
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:12,014
I even tried writing
a story once.

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,782
Couldn't get past pagene,
too many decisions.

6
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:16,495
Where do you find the body?

7
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,789
au all these stories
start with a body, right?

8
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,603
Do you find it by a pool
under a sunset

9
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,246
the color of a blood orange?

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,256
Or is it night,
with the twinkling lights of the city?

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,554
And what about the victim?

12
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,778
A movie producer
in a sharkskin suit

13
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:34,624
who we think probably got
what he deserved...

14
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:37,452
Some beautiful starlet
who fell in with the wrong crowd

15
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:38,873
and never saw it coming...

16
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,955
But you know the real reason
that I never wrote one of those stories?

17
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:43,495
I became a cop.

18
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:48,050
And I found out the images
that I had in my head

19
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:49,328
weren't like real life.

20
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:51,612
Take the case that I got
this morning.

21
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:54,456
The body wasn't found
by a swimming pool high in the hills.

22
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,236
It turned up in a parking lot
by the 101.

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,393
And the victim wasn't
some movie weasel or starlet.

24
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:03,863
It was a poor young woman
in cargo pants and sneakers

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,245
with a bullet hole in her back,
laying facedown the pavement.

26
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,840
We did a close sweep,
the trash cans, bushes.

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,531
No purse, no wallet.

28
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:13,261
I got the registration.

29
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:18,073
Sandy Boudreau,
121 Bendix Avenue, Apartment 12.

30
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:19,625
Let's go check it out.

31
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,189
Okay. We're going to Bendix.

32
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:40,698
This is it, the apartment's
up there somewhere.

33
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,327
That tower's the elevator.

34
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,003
Apartment 12.

35
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:51,628
Start knocking on doors.

36
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:49,689
I don't know
if you'd like that.

37
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,265
- Who are you?
- You first.

38
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:53,871
Raines, LAPD.

39
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:57,864
Are you her sister
or something?

40
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:00,081
Do you see one
in the photographs?

41
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,677
I didn't have a sister,
Detective.

42
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:08,848
You didn't have a sister.

43
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:11,308
You being?

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,310
Sandy.

45
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:13,657
Boudreau.

46
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:21,516
I think his name is Marco,
but they broke up,

47
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:22,737
uh, a few weeks ago.

48
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:25,076
Detective!

49
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:26,664
Boudreau had a boyfriend.

50
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Keep knocking.

51
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,142
Keep knocking.

52
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:36,774
Sandy Boudreau,
that's the victim's name.

53
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:38,053
That's right.

54
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:39,404
So it's happening again.

55
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:40,405
Happening again.

56
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:42,762
I can't do this, Charlie,
can't handle it.

57
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:43,809
You handled it before.

58
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,363
If you call that
handling it.

59
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,124
I'm losing my mind.

60
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:48,216
Are you?

61
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:49,874
Oh, I don't know,
I just had a conversation

62
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,860
with a girl who wasn't there.
What'd you call it?

63
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:54,023
I wouldn't exactly call that
a conversation.

64
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,690
The girl says her name
and you run out the door.

65
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,788
Not only is that
bad police work, that's rude.

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,843
Okay, I don't know why
I bother talking to you.

67
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:04,157
Maybe because I carried
your ass for 13 years.

68
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:05,161
You carried me?

69
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,360
First case on your own,
you already need my help.

70
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,916
No. The only help
I need from you on this case

71
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:11,819
is figuring out why
this is happening to me.

72
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,893
Why she's haunting me.

73
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,254
Oh, she's a ghost now.
Hallucination.

74
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,292
You know she's not a ghost.
Hallucination.

75
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:19,742
It's all in your head,
right, exactly, Michael. It's all you.

76
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,112
Look, you have two choices, right?

77
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,349
You could run away,
and get yourself committed

78
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,600
to some institution, and
get shot up with tranquilizers.

79
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,601
Tranquilizers.

80
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,473
- That sounds good, tranquilizers.
- Or you can do your job.

81
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,412
Go back there,
see what she wants.

82
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,413
Just talk to her.

83
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:35,765
Look, the victim has
always been your thing, right?

84
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:37,825
"Know the victim,
find the killer.

85
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,815
"Know the victim,
find the killer."

86
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,177
You used to talk to the victim
while we were driving around.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,263
Well, but I didn't see--
I didn't see them!

88
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,481
You know, that was
behind my eyes.

89
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:49,185
Now, now it's, uh,
you know, out there.

90
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:53,337
Look, maybe this will make you
a better detective.

91
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:54,552
Oh, shut up.

92
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,170
What do you want?

93
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,281
It's your imagination,
Detective.

94
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:21,329
I'm just the figment.

95
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,898
What do you want?

96
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,591
I want you to find out
who killed me.

97
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:30,814
Then you'll back whatever
dark, twisted,

98
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:34,437
malfunctioning part of my brain
that you come from?

99
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,753
Yeah.

100
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,849
What are you writing?

101
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:53,889
Uh, a note

102
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,940
instructing
whoever finds my body

103
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,883
after I blow my brains out
to scatter the ashes

104
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,299
over Disneyland 'cause it's
the happiest place on Earth.

105
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,744
You always this sarcastic?

106
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:07,617
Who are you calling?

107
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,959
You're calling me.

108
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:11,699
Hi, y'all, this is Sandy.

109
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,519
I'm not here right now,
leave a message. Bye.

110
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,280
Well, you got a Texas accent.

111
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:20,238
Well, now isn't that
an interesting development?

112
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:22,845
Easy on the drawl there, Tex.

113
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:24,647
You're not riding the back 40
at Crawford.

114
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,087
Sounds like you came here
when you were a kid.

115
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:28,796
Whatever you say,
Detective.

116
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,988
You're the boss.

117
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:33,770
Fashion show.

118
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,995
Sweet, vintage-y.

119
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:38,794
Kind of a sweater girl.

120
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:43,213
And a wet suit.
Fantastic Voyage.

121
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,928
Cheerleader.
What's the story here?

122
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:53,438
Maybe they're for Halloween?

123
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,919
I can see the jumping,
the twirling.

124
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,639
That's good.

125
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,385
Hey, that check out there.

126
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:03,719
Does that mean you were working
for a catering company?

127
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,801
If you say so.

128
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,463
Wanna tell me what this
is all about?

129
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,797
I really wish I could help you,
Detective.

130
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:15,957
I only know what you know.

131
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:18,920
<i>- Raines.
- Hey, it's Caroline.</i>

132
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,922
Caroline, what's up?

133
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,472
<i>We got the perp on your 187.</i>

134
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,576
<i>- Are you serious?
- That's what the Captain says.</i>

135
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,688
I'll be right there.

136
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:31,712
You said if I caught
whoever killed you, you'd go?

137
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:32,835
- Yeah.
- Then go.

138
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,176
We got your killer.

139
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,971
They found the suspect in one
of the homeless camps in Griffith Park

140
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:40,595
He had Sandyoudreau's purse
with him,

141
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:44,142
containing, among other things,
$950 in mixed 20s and 50s.

142
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,062
He also had blood on him.

143
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:47,983
Matches type with Boudreau.

144
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,891
His name is William Jones,
known to the residents

145
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:53,336
of the camp where he lives
as Skunk.

146
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,339
And they call him that because he's got
a big white stripe down his back?

147
00:07:58,073 --> 00:07:59,073
No.

148
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:03,777
Oh, my God.

149
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:05,578
Mr. Jones.

150
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:08,937
- I didn't do it.
- I'm glad.

151
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:10,104
I smell bad, don't I?

152
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:12,616
Keeps the sickos away.

153
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:13,639
The sickos?

154
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,695
The ones that come up
into the camps.

155
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,711
Take our stuff,
beat on us.

156
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,022
You got skunk on you?

157
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:21,539
I find their dens,
poke 'em with a stick,

158
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:23,368
and get 'em to spray me.

159
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,421
Doesn't it bother you?

160
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,811
I got kicked in the head
back in '86,

161
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,982
Ain't smelled a thing since.

162
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:30,578
I didn't do it.

163
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,986
You sure about that?

164
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,632
Arresting officer says you couldn't
remember anything about last night.

165
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,587
- I didn't do it.
- You know that you didn't do it?

166
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:40,088
Or you know that that's not
the kind of thing

167
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,368
that you could ever do?

168
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,596
We've all got a dark side,
Mr. Jones.

169
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,395
I know I do,
stuffed way down deep inside

170
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,049
that I don't even wanna
think about.

171
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,272
'Cause I'm a good guy.

172
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,814
Like you're a good guy.

173
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:52,672
But I koow what'd happen
if that dark stuff ever got out.

174
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:53,950
What I'd be capable of.

175
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,724
But I'm not gonna do it
'cause I'm a good guy.

176
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:58,425
Just like you.

177
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,691
When I'm in control.

178
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,211
And I'm always in control.

179
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:06,392
Almost always.

180
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:12,164
You a drinking man, Mr. Jones?

181
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:13,299
You know I am.

182
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,447
Were you drinking last night?

183
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,448
You know I was.

184
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:16,607
But I didn't do it.

185
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,703
Didn't do it or can't rember?

186
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:25,718
I can't remember.

187
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:28,173
I can't remember.

188
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:33,475
Process him.

189
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:35,281
You call that a confession?

190
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:37,661
They found the victim's wallet on him,
the victim's blood on him.

191
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,292
No gun, no powder residue
on his hands.

192
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,287
Maybe he found her already dead
and robbed her.

193
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:44,192
Or maybe he shot her, threw away
the gun, and washed his hands.

194
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:46,646
Well, that would be the first thing
he's washed in a long time.

195
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:48,752
What about that shoebox full of cash?

196
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,546
What about it, Nancy Drew?

197
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:52,028
That could be anything.

198
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:54,956
I suppose to a civilian employee
like you, everything seems mysterious.

199
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,524
- Everything seems important.
- Okay.

200
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,603
The truth is, is most things
in most murder investigations

201
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,789
don't mean damn thing.

202
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,108
That's what we learn
in detective school.

203
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:03,586
Process him.

204
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:08,295
Oh, she's gone.

205
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:11,407
Oh, she wasn't at the station,
she wasn't in my car.

206
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,804
Gone, gone, gone, gone.

207
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,249
Yeah, one question.
Shoot.

208
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:15,716
Is she gone?

209
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,216
Gone.

210
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,949
Yeah, thank goodness!

211
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,501
Good, well, who killed
Sandy Boudreau?

212
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,844
Some poor old wino.

213
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:26,494
A wino with a.38?

214
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,042
Yeah.

215
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:37,054
Not gone?

216
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,057
Not gone.

217
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,452
She's right there
right now?

218
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,341
Yes, roller skates
and everything.

219
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:53,901
That is so cool.

220
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,219
No, Charlie, it's not cool.
She was supposed to go away.

221
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,331
Sweetie, you were
supposed to go away.

222
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,776
Well, maybe you haven't solved
the case yet.

223
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:03,054
The guy had her blood on him,
her wallet.

224
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,552
Nah, maybe you haven't solved
it to your satisfaction.

225
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,932
- What's that mean?
- Pretend we're still partners, right?

226
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,624
We're in the car,
we're driving around, right?

227
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:12,202
You've gone all silent because
something is naggi you.

228
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,480
She had a bank account.

229
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:16,517
So what was she doing
with $20,000 in a shoebox?

230
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,106
Tips from her catering job?

231
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:20,384
20,000 in tips,
that's some catering job.

232
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,881
And what about
the cheerleading outfit,

233
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,101
the school uniform,
the wet suit?

234
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,067
She liked to play
dress up.

235
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,023
She cute?

236
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,693
Mm, she's cute.

237
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,033
LAPD, Caroline speaking.

238
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,538
Caroline, this is Raines.

239
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,248
Do not, I repeat, do not
say I told you so,

240
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,249
but hold off
on processing the wino.

241
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,004
I told you so.

242
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:47,169
Thank you, Caroline.

243
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:48,661
You're a dear.

244
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:52,415
Yeah, they cater all right.

245
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,864
It's called Romeo & Juliet.

246
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:54,865
Romeo & Juliet.

247
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,153
Jackson, over in Vice, says
it's an escort service.

248
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:59,558
And what's the address?

249
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,453
It's on Sunset, 700 block,
down by Gower.

250
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:04,332
Thanks, Caroline.

251
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,424
Tell me about
the catering company

252
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,425
that you work for.

253
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:20,379
Seems to me you already know.

254
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,461
It was a front
for the Romeo & Juliet escort service.

255
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:23,462
See? I was right.

256
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:26,071
You already knew.

257
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:32,778
Why didn't you tell me
you were a prostitute?

258
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,414
Because it never
occurred to you.

259
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,407
May I ask a question?

260
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:47,461
Did you find any cigarettes?

261
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,860
Why am I smoking?

262
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:53,113
Maybe for the same reason
I'm drinking,

263
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:55,225
even though you didn't find
any booze.

264
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,722
Same reason my makeup's headed
for circus clown,

265
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:01,000
and my boobs have gained
three cup sizes.

266
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,118
You found out I'm a whore.

267
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:06,320
And this is what a whore
looks like, right?

268
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:10,386
Thank you.

269
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,741
Don't argue with me, Arlene.

270
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,019
It's in here somewhere.

271
00:13:15,096 --> 00:13:16,847
We gotta check every inch
of this place.

272
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:17,848
You understand?

273
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:24,804
That catering job
must've paid well.

274
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:25,862
The view is nice.

275
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,751
Ah, it's stupid to pay
for a view.

276
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,971
Your eyes are closed
most of the time.

277
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,036
I wondered where
that went to.

278
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:35,773
What?

279
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,382
That duck with four legs
she made in the third grade.

280
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,828
Hey, would you take your little trip
down memory lane some other time?

281
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,541
We gotta find it before the cops do,
otherwise we'll never see it.

282
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,387
That's my ma.

283
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,884
They can't hear me,
you know that.

284
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:54,504
Sorry, LAPD.

285
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,319
Uh, Detective Raines.

286
00:13:58,154 --> 00:13:59,431
You're Sandy's parents?

287
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,261
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

288
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:02,262
My job.

289
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:03,610
Uh, what are your names?

290
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,611
Vernon and Arlene.

291
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,471
Boudreau.

292
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,893
I think he figured
that much out, Arlene.

293
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:11,972
What you hoping
to find here, Chester?

294
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:12,741
Are you deaf?

295
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:14,408
I just said my name
is Vernon.

296
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:18,146
There's money here.

297
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:20,547
Daughter was sending her
little bits

298
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:21,714
so's I wouldn't know.

299
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,342
She said there was more for her.

300
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:25,002
Chester, anything we find
in here is evidence.

301
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:25,855
Evidence, my ass.

302
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,689
Everything in here belongs to me.

303
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,109
And why the hell do you
keep calling me Chester?

304
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,110
Honest mistake.

305
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,774
See, I didn't even know
that your daughter had a father.

306
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:35,673
Your wife I recognized
from the photos.

307
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,772
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

308
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,275
But see, in the photos,
you're missing, Chester.

309
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:41,078
Not just missing,
you're cut out.

310
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,738
All that's left of you
is your arm.

311
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:43,882
Why would Sandy do that?

312
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,534
I wonder.

313
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,687
So I was calling you Chester
'cause it rhymes

314
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:47,688
with molester.

315
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:53,400
Should've noticed that
your father's arm in that photo

316
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:55,456
was a heavily...
heavily-muscled arm.

317
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,305
Why'd you say that
to him?

318
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,521
Very few people get
into your line of work

319
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:09,067
because having sex
with strangers for money

320
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:10,768
was their favorite booth
on career day.

321
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,102
Nine times out of ten,
they were molested.

322
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,278
You have no idea.

323
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,929
He'd come into my room
every night--

324
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,930
Sandy.

325
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,205
He didn't molest you.

326
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:21,384
Well, then why'd
you say he did?

327
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:23,693
To check the reaction,
not his, your mother's.

328
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:24,988
Mothers always know
what's going on,

329
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,141
even though they say
they don't.

330
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,697
Your mother looked like
I was talking Martian.

331
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,053
Now, Arlene!

332
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,831
Don't stand there
like a heifer!

333
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,862
You need to calm yourself! Now!

334
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:35,085
Get in there, come on!

335
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,290
Is this what you want?

336
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:38,917
Get my lawyer on the phone!

337
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,127
Now, Arlene!
Calm down!

338
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:41,071
Let's go, go!

339
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:42,072
Call my lawyer!

340
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:43,977
Of course, just because
you weren't molested

341
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,482
doesn't mean
you weren't abused.

342
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:47,234
He knocked you around,
didn't he?

343
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,540
Well, there's gotta be
some reason I'm a hooker.

344
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,237
Is that it?

345
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:51,904
I know that
he beats your mom.

346
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:53,878
How in the hell
do you know that?

347
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:55,091
He's quick with his fists,

348
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:56,814
and she flinches
when he talks.

349
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:58,949
You're just doing
everything you can

350
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,505
to make me sympathetic,
aren't you, Detective?

351
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:02,959
You wanted to solve
the murder

352
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,555
of a sweet,
young college student.

353
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:05,610
But a white trash hooker?

354
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,951
No, it wouldn't matter to me if you were
the Queen of the Rose Parade.

355
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:10,214
I just want to solve
your murder and saysayonara.

356
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,548
Nothing personal, Sandy.

357
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,583
Your ex-partner.

358
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:25,190
Charlie.

359
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,413
How'd he get the cane?

360
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,768
Took a bullet
three months back.

361
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,140
Several bullets...
we both did.

362
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:30,942
He got the worst
of it.

363
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:31,943
What happened?

364
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:33,582
Wrong place,
wrong time.

365
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,316
Uh, we were on Yucca,
looking for a guy,

366
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:38,983
and this idiot crank dealer
named Laszlo saw us,

367
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:40,678
thought we were rival
drug dealers,

368
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,380
came out and just opened up.
We fired back.

369
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:43,934
One of my bullets went in
through Laszlo's eye

370
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:44,990
and out the back of his head.

371
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:46,083
- So he's dead.
- Yeah.

372
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,206
That'll pretty much
kill you.

373
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,429
I know, I was kidding.

374
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,316
Where we going,
Detective?

375
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,009
To see your pimp,
Sandy.

376
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:11,561
Detective Raines, LAPD.

377
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,365
You know this girl?
Sandy Boudreau.

378
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,366
Sandy Boo-what?

379
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,421
How long you gonna run
that play?

380
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:18,674
We both know how it ends.

381
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:19,771
She in some kind
of trouble?

382
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,105
Not anymore,
she's dead.

383
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,280
I need the names of her clients,
start with her regulars.

384
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,632
She wasn't working much
anymore.

385
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:27,966
She was going to school.

386
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:29,543
Trying to get out
of the life.

387
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:31,710
Give me your customers
this past month.

388
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,029
Well, she only had one.

389
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,819
Came in through
the website on Monday.

390
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:42,626
I sent her
to the Townhouse Motel

391
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:43,627
on Sunset.

392
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:44,581
Look, there's no way

393
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:47,786
I can tell you
who was here on what day,
and in what room.

394
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:49,593
Uh, she could've been dressed
like a cheerleader.

395
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:50,594
A cheerleader.

396
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,551
Yeah, that, uh, that rings
a bell, actually.

397
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:55,245
A cheerleader.

398
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:56,297
She'd just twisted her ankle,

399
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:57,999
uh, so she might've been
using a cane.

400
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,055
A cane, yeah, actually,
you're right.

401
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,974
Now it's all coming
back to me.

402
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:04,037
Her face was made up
like a mime?

403
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,117
It's funny you say that
'cause rember thinking,

404
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,663
"What's up
with this mime makeup?"

405
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:10,441
You know, she had this--
oh, okay, aah, all right.

406
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,859
That hurts.
I certainly hope so.

407
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,563
Is that security camera
outside real?

408
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:14,112
And don't lie.

409
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:16,168
You lying to me
doesn't work so good.

410
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:25,445
You picked me to do this
because you don't like me.

411
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,151
No, I picked her to do this
because one day

412
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:28,349
she's gonna be
a lead detective.

413
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,473
You can go scratch your butt
with a rake for all I care.

414
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,426
Press play.
I'm gonna file a grievance.

415
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:34,093
Of course you are.
Press play.

416
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,478
We got Sandy Boudreau's
cell phone records.

417
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,385
Caroline pulled these
DMV photos of everybody

418
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,534
that she
talked to recently.

419
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,088
So while I'm out talking
to them,

420
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,838
you see if any of these people
went to the motel.

421
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,839
Yeah, okay.

422
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:47,891
Michael.

423
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:49,116
Walk with me.

424
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:52,641
How you doing?
You okay?

425
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,604
Why, because I accused Boudreau
of being a child molester?

426
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,059
Nah, it was nothing,
everyone does that.

427
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,260
I do that five times
a day.

428
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:01,075
Yeah, can I have a tall mocha,
you child-molesting bastard?

429
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:02,887
You shouldn't say that.
You don't say that, do you?

430
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:04,144
Michael,
what are you thinking,

431
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:06,368
accusing a grieving father
of being a child molester?

432
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,764
Grieving father--
the only thing on his mind

433
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:10,183
upon entering his dead daughter's
apartment was "where's the money?"

434
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,300
Where is the money?

435
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:13,013
I spent it
on lottery tickets.

436
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:14,390
Did you get me some?

437
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:16,496
Do I look like an idiot?
Of course I did.

438
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:18,108
Dan, the money's
in evidence.

439
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,949
Mrs. Boudreau's begging us
to drop charges

440
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,227
against husband Vernon.

441
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,203
No surprise,
classic abused spouse.

442
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,911
I don't think we're gonna get
a conviction for him hitting you.

443
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:27,761
You know, grieving father,
inflammatory words.

444
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:28,463
I know.

445
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:29,686
Good.
And you're okay?

446
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:30,816
Yeah, Dan. Why?

447
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:35,808
Boyer says he's seen you
talk to yourself.

448
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:38,925
I was talking to myself.

449
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,315
Well.

450
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,519
If you ever want someone
more interesting to talk to,

451
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
my door is open.

452
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,170
It's good to have you back,
Michael.

453
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:51,879
Is this where I say,
"It's good to be back?"

454
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,315
Oh, no, no, no,
this is where you say

455
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,123
something clever to remind me
how smart you are.

456
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:56,815
I'm rusty, give me
a couple days.

457
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:58,800
Sandy Boudreau...no.

458
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:02,543
I'm sorry, I...

459
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:04,395
Honey, do you
recognize her?

460
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,346
No.

461
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:06,958
Uh, she made a call
to a cell

462
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,076
belonging to your husband
two nights ago.

463
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:12,509
Must've been
a wrong number.

464
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,857
Call lasted four minutes.

465
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,262
Maybe the housekeeper
borrowed one of the phones?

466
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,374
Oh, is she here now?

467
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,489
No, but she'll
be back tomorrow.

468
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,237
- Have her call me, would you?
- Sure.

469
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:22,240
Thanks so much.

470
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:23,241
Okay.
Okey dokey.

471
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,651
You're welcome.

472
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:31,094
Was he lying?

473
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:33,448
Could be.

474
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,249
He wouldn't say anything
with his wife standing there.

475
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:39,259
Where now?

476
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,271
Uh, the neighbor said
that you had a boyfriend

477
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,777
named Marco
up until a few weeks ago.

478
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:46,000
He called you 12 times
the day you died.

479
00:20:47,217 --> 00:20:49,107
Uh, your roommate said
you'd be here.

480
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:51,379
I'm here about Sandy Boudreau.
Where were you two nights ago?

481
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,238
I was here from 7:00
till midnight.

482
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,085
You want me to prove it?

483
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,141
Not yet.
You and Sandy, uh, met here?

484
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,477
She used to do leg lifts
on that machine over there.

485
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:01,206
I used to watch her.

486
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:04,398
She was just so beautiful.

487
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:08,392
Until one day she asked me
to spot her on the bench.

488
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:13,154
What else do you
wanna know, man?

489
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:16,369
Well, why'd you and Sandy
break up?

490
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,272
Was it because of her job?

491
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,942
Marco, if you're trying to protect her,
I already know what she did.

492
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:32,756
She dumped me.

493
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
I didn't care.

494
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:37,392
You didn't care that
your girlfriend was a hooker?

495
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:39,446
All right, I did, but...

496
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,808
I thought she could stop.

497
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,374
And she said she couldn't
because she need money

498
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,375
for her mother.

499
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:46,576
For her mother?

500
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:49,783
And I told her that I could give her
whatever money she needed, and she said,

501
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,519
"How is that any different
than what I'm doing now?"

502
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:55,592
And she didn't want
to see me anymore.

503
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:58,148
So I was thinking,
maybe if I was different...

504
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,049
You know,
like it wamy fault.

505
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,105
But now I'm thinking maybe
I had nothing to do with it.

506
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,662
Maybe something else was going
on that I didn't know about.

507
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:09,163
Maybe she wasn't
into guys.

508
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,892
You thought she was gay?

509
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:14,156
Yeah, sounds pathetic,
doesn't it?

510
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:15,919
Some girl doesn't want
to see you anymore,

511
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,420
and she must be gay,
right?

512
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:19,275
Yeah.

513
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:22,792
You think he did it?

514
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,384
The boyfriend?

515
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:25,583
You know how I work, Charlie.

516
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,186
I think everybody did it,
then I slowly whittle

517
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:28,687
away the ones who couldn't.

518
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,629
It feels like,
um, I'm...passing?

519
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,851
I'm talking to these people.
I'm asking my questions.

520
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:38,502
Yet, all the while,
I'm thinking,

521
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:41,225
"They have no idea how
utterly whacked out I am."

522
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:43,865
You're going through
something extremely weird.

523
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,872
Well, you're still
working the case.

524
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:47,039
Getting the job done.

525
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:49,139
There's nothing wrong
with that.

526
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,869
Raines.

527
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,433
Caroline.

528
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,652
I'll be right there.

529
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:58,359
Give her my regards.

530
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,871
There we go.

531
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,771
"To the detective
on the Sandy Boudreau case,

532
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:13,438
Vista Heights
Investigations."

533
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,475
Laird McSweeney?

534
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:17,078
That private eye creep
down on Hollywood Boulevard?

535
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,079
The same.

536
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:20,135
What you got
for me, Laird?

537
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:23,847
My, my...

538
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:27,647
The victim and Harry Tucker,
the guy with the cell phone.

539
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:32,937
Why'd you lie?

540
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,489
Because Wendy
was right there.

541
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,293
Mm-hmm, you helped
a nice young woman

542
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:38,296
clean up spilled coffee.

543
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,027
Why would you have to keep
that from your wife?

544
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:41,655
She's been very suspicious
of me.

545
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:42,878
She have reason to be?

546
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,281
I did something stupid
on a business trip

547
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:48,717
two years ago, and Wendy says
that she's forgiven me,

548
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,218
but sometimes
I don't know.

549
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:52,970
I think Wendy is afraid
that I'm going to leave her

550
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:54,804
for a younger model,
and I'm not.

551
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:58,574
How did Sandy Boudreau
get your cell phone number?

552
00:23:58,575 --> 00:23:59,575
I don't know.

553
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,963
Maybe you left it
on the table

554
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:02,811
at the motel after you made
sweet monkey love to her?

555
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:04,534
No, we never...
I spoke to her.

556
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:12,974
What's his motive?

557
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,283
Maybe she, uh, threatened
to tell his wife.

558
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:16,837
Maybe she saw him naked
and laughed.

559
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,735
It always comes down
to penis size, doesn't it?

560
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:19,736
Pretty much.

561
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:22,489
We got a match
from the motel security video.

562
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,197
Him?

563
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:24,198
No

564
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:29,434
Okay, go in tighter
and freeze it.

565
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:32,758
Marco Rossi.

566
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:34,412
The ex-boyfriend.

567
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:10,252
Don't shoot!

568
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:12,909
Freeze!

569
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:14,364
Get down! Get down!

570
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:16,358
Down to the floor!
Get down to the floor!

571
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,316
Marco.

572
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,317
Do not move!

573
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,399
He's going out the back!

574
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:49,015
All units,
suspect heading west down the alley.

575
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:51,892
A garbage truck.

576
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:53,042
Yes, sir.

577
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,498
You know, given
the amount of steroids

578
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:57,305
and amphetamines you found,
your boy Marco's

579
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,639
probably peddled his way
to Mexico by now.

580
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,110
I got through to McSweeney.
He's line three.

581
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:03,555
McSweeney the private eye?

582
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:04,462
That guy's an asswipe.

583
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,463
Uh, Laird?

584
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:06,812
Who wants to know?

585
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:08,815
Oh, this is Detective Raines.

586
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,719
I'm trying to reach
Laird McSweeney.

587
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,977
Mike, you're talking
to Detective Smith, Central.

588
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:13,978
Bobby.

589
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:15,981
I'm afraid you talking
to Laird McSweeney's

590
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:17,537
gonna be a bit
of a problem.

591
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:23,922
Tell the M. E. he can send
his people up.

592
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:30,268
How long has he been dead?

593
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:31,769
Couple hours,
give or take.

594
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:33,475
You know him?

595
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,336
Uh...yeah,
our paths crossed.

596
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,249
He was a private eye.

597
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,015
Mostly peeper work,
divorce cases, custody battles,

598
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:44,849
suspicious spouse...

599
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:47,441
But he also liked
to cross the line.

600
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:49,553
Take some pictures,
then ask for money.

601
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:50,352
Blackmail.

602
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:51,697
That's what they call it.

603
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:52,698
Camera's gone.

604
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,327
Seem so.
Computer too.

605
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,055
Maybe somebody didn't like
the kind of pictures

606
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:58,111
that he was taking.

607
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:02,794
Huh, it seems that somebody
didn't know that Laird

608
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:06,511
had a backup hard drive.

609
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:11,793
So I guess there's
the coffee spilling thing

610
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:12,794
he mentioned.

611
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:16,318
Then I guess, uh, they're
gonna sit down together.

612
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:18,077
Just them having coffee.

613
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:20,555
Nothing of them making
the beast with two backs?

614
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,389
No, but there
is this last group.

615
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:25,007
He's taken off.

616
00:27:25,214 --> 00:27:26,269
She's just leaving.

617
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:29,274
She's just walking
across the street.

618
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:30,330
Leaving by herself.

619
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,200
She knew the pictures
were being taken.

620
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:45,347
Say, can I have some privacy, guys?
I'm making a...

621
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:47,403
I'm on a classified call
here, sorry.

622
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:48,603
Penthouse is nice.

623
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:00,519
What a nut,
he's gonna do it.

624
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:16,098
You knew the pictures
were being taken.

625
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:18,435
First time
you tried blackmail?

626
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:19,436
You tell me.

627
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,051
No, I wanna hear it
from you.

628
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:26,905
McSweeney and I decided
to target

629
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,017
a wealthy, middle-aged,
married fella.

630
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,768
One who had never dreamed
that a fox in socks

631
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:34,267
like yours truly would want
to jump his bones.

632
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:36,212
All I had to do
was get him in bed.

633
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,147
Sweeney would snap
some candids,

634
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:40,526
and we'd threaten to show 'em
to the wife...

635
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:41,527
Forget it.

636
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:43,378
It's not right.

637
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,633
It's like all of a sudden you turned
into Kathleen Turner fromBody Heat.

638
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:48,300
And what's
with the cigarette?

639
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:53,416
You weren't blackmailing anybody, Sandy.
You're not that kind of person.

640
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,588
What kind of person
am I?

641
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,253
The kind who saves money
to send to her mother

642
00:28:58,254 --> 00:28:59,976
to escape
her horrible husband.

643
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:02,756
Whore with a heart
of gold?

644
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:04,201
Yeah, something like that.

645
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:07,886
Then why was I killed?

646
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:11,322
I don't know, I got a couple
of suspects, no motive.

647
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,211
Why do people usually
kill people?

648
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,209
Uh, greed, ambition,
anger, fear.

649
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:17,192
What about love?

650
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:20,943
Detective!

651
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:24,748
Detective!

652
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,056
Raines!

653
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:33,382
They located Marco.

654
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:34,691
We're waiting on you.

655
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:53,016
Primary move.

656
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:00,420
Last call

657
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:02,087
for the San Francisco Express.

658
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:05,296
Last boarding call for
the San Francisco Express.

659
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,379
Everybody move, take him down.

660
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,099
All units respond, yeah, yeah.

661
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:38,300
We need an R. E. unit
to the bus station.

662
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:39,753
I was hoping you'd put him
in handcuffs,

663
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,754
not in traction.

664
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:43,288
I was responding,
he comes out of nowhere!

665
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:46,160
Does he have a pulse?

666
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:47,161
Yeah.

667
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:50,424
What the hell's wrong
with you?

668
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:51,702
He came out of nowhere.

669
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:06,448
All right, get those people back.

670
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,449
Keep 'em back.

671
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:10,108
Come on, people, listen up,
move it back!

672
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,109
Move it back.

673
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,720
You're lucky
he's still breathing.

674
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:23,611
Police emergency, out!

675
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:24,791
- What?
- Now!

676
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:27,171
Come on-- no washing,
no washing!

677
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:29,525
Go, go, go, go, go,
scoot! Scoot!

678
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:34,399
You said that the motive
might be love,

679
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,807
but Marco didn't kill you, did he?

680
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:37,303
If he didn't, then why
was he running away?

681
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,156
We found steroids
and speed in his apartment.

682
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,157
Did he kill you?

683
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:40,962
Why would he?

684
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:42,318
He already knew
I was a hooker.

685
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,215
Maybe he wanted
that shoebox money.

686
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:45,716
Then why didn't he
take it?

687
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,892
Huh. Maybe he found out
something else about you.

688
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:51,689
I like to bite the heads
off chickens?

689
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:54,200
He followed you
to the motel.

690
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,241
What did he say?

691
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:57,455
She says she couldn't

692
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,567
because she need money
for her mother.

693
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:02,861
And I told her that I could give her
whatever money she needed, and she said,

694
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:05,862
"How ithat any different
than what I'm already doing?"

695
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,160
She didn't want
to see me anymore.

696
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:10,734
So, I thought what can
I do different?

697
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:12,964
Thought it was my fault.

698
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,884
Then again, maybe it didn't
have anything to do with me.

699
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:17,718
Like, maybe she wasn't
into guys.

700
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,262
Why would he think
you didn't like guys?

701
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:24,342
You liked guys,
didn't you?

702
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,144
As far as I know.

703
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:29,943
What would make him
think I didn't?

704
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,159
Where you going?

705
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:39,579
To talk to Marco and look at
the motel security video again.

706
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
Why?

707
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,945
I think I know
who killed you.

708
00:32:50,154 --> 00:32:52,431
I never found any evidence
of Harry going

709
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:54,561
to the Townhouse Motel
and hiring Sandy.

710
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:56,006
Because I didn't go there.

711
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,732
I know that you didn't,
Harry.

712
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,629
Believe me, I kept hoping
that you'd show up,

713
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,630
but you didn't.

714
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:01,780
But somebody else did,

715
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:04,336
somebody that we weren't
looking for at first.

716
00:33:16,635 --> 00:33:18,301
I don't...
I don't understand.

717
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,435
That doesn't mean
anything.

718
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:22,439
What motive could Wendy
possibly have?

719
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Love.

720
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:29,600
Or at least the kind of love
that's been deformed

721
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,989
by a fear of abandonment.

722
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:33,694
Wendy was terrified
of being your ex-wife.

723
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:38,394
I just want you to follow
my husband around for a few days.

724
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,324
So she hired
a private investigator

725
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:41,491
to have you followed.

726
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,812
And when he didn't find
anything,

727
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:45,358
she couldn't let it go.

728
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:46,654
She set a honey trap.

729
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:49,455
She paid Sandy Boudreau
to seduce you.

730
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,552
And Mrs. Tucker, before
you say that you didn't,

731
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:54,608
I've got a witness,
her ex-boyfriend,

732
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:57,157
who, when he gets out
of the hospital,

733
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:59,214
will testify that
he saw you at a motel,

734
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:00,326
handing Sandy money.

735
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:01,121
And we've got

736
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,844
your thumbprint
from a $50 bill

737
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,852
that we found
under Sandy's body.

738
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:07,522
So...

739
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,185
You all right?
Hold on.

740
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:10,186
Harry meets Sandy.

741
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:11,586
You okay?

742
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:12,975
Peeper's taking pictures.

743
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:15,303
- I'm Harry, by the way.
- Sandy. Delighted.

744
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,970
...I do.
Did you grow up here?

745
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,410
I did not.

746
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,133
Look at that!
Oh, look at that.

747
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,607
Take good care,
all right?

748
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:24,716
Everything's going great.

749
00:34:24,717 --> 00:34:27,217
One small problem,
Harry doesn't take the bait.

750
00:34:27,218 --> 00:34:30,218
And that's where the story
could've, shouldhave ended.

751
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:32,996
But it didn't, did it?

752
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:37,449
When she called you,
you met in that parking lot,

753
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,553
she said she wanted to give
back the money.

754
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,237
- I'm not gonna take the money back.
- He wants you, just accept that!

755
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,238
I want you to go back
and try again!

756
00:34:45,593 --> 00:34:46,759
You wouldn't take it.

757
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,297
You wanted her to keep trying.

758
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:51,353
You couldn't accept
that your husband

759
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:53,709
could be faithful.

760
00:34:58,677 --> 00:35:01,232
She said something to you,
and then she headed

761
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,379
back for her car.

762
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:05,736
And whatever she said to you
got you so angry

763
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:07,638
or so scared,

764
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:09,943
that you snapped.

765
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,665
What, honey?
What did she say?

766
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,116
She said...

767
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:19,317
You know what?
I'm gonna try it again.

768
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:21,571
I'm gonna give him the money
back next time I see him.

769
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:23,127
I'm gonna tell him
everytng!

770
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,045
I didn't mean to kill her,
Detective.

771
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:38,041
I just wanted to stop her.

772
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,450
I know.

773
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:42,600
I bet your legal team
will argue, successfully,

774
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:45,212
that it was a crime of passion,
or that the gun

775
00:35:45,461 --> 00:35:46,461
just went off.

776
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,207
And you might only get
manslaughter

777
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,708
for killing Sandy Boudreau.

778
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:54,354
But McSweeney,
the private eye...

779
00:35:58,341 --> 00:35:59,563
That was premeditated.

780
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:03,967
You might just get
the needle for that.

781
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:24,902
You're still here.

782
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,509
You know, I'm startin'
to think you don't like me.

783
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,287
I like you fine,
Sandy Boudreau.

784
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:32,030
I wish I'd known you.

785
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:35,200
But, uh, you said you'd go
if I caught your killer.

786
00:36:36,178 --> 00:36:37,178
Yet here you are.

787
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:41,092
Is there something else
I can do for you, Sandy?

788
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:43,587
There is one thing.

789
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,636
Tell me.

790
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:57,136
I don't need this crap
in the house.

791
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:58,137
All right, Vernon.

792
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,220
I'm not keepin'-- oh, God.

793
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:20,387
So sorry to startle you,
Mrs. Boudreau.

794
00:37:20,628 --> 00:37:22,405
Um, I need to talk
to you alone.

795
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:24,691
What about?

796
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,114
I've got some bad news.

797
00:37:26,382 --> 00:37:28,167
There was a screw up
at the evidence locker,

798
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,890
and Sandy's money
has gone missing.

799
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:31,144
What?

800
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:35,007
Vernon will
not be pleased.

801
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,364
What's this?

802
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,579
I'm sorry that the money's
missing, Mrs. Boudreau,

803
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:00,738
because I know that Sandy
wantedyouto have it.

804
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:04,570
She wanted
a better life for you.

805
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:07,714
She woulda done just
about anything to help you.

806
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:12,203
Of course, even if somehow
the money were

807
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:13,851
to magically reappear,
you still might

808
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:16,463
just hand it over to Vernon,
or, you might not.

809
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,423
Either way,
it'd be up to you.

810
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:26,919
See that CD?

811
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,672
May I have that?

812
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:30,700
Uh, it's in the trash.

813
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,150
Detective!

814
00:38:44,148 --> 00:38:45,925
Was Sandy mixed up
in something?

815
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:53,162
No.

816
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:57,993
She was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

817
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:20,997
Thanks.

818
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:24,703
For not telling my mama
I was a prostitute.

819
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:28,095
No point in that,
dear.

820
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:31,124
No point in that.

821
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,829
Arlene.

822
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:38,837
Now, come on, Arlene,

823
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:40,291
would you kick it
into gear?

824
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:42,497
I wanna get the hell out
of L. A. and back to Texas.

825
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:43,498
Okay.

826
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,644
Looks like your mother
finally...

827
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:08,141
All right, all right.

828
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,534
It's probably rap.

829
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:47,503
Is she gone?

830
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,113
So far.

831
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
I keep looking.

832
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:56,439
Hey, what if this happens
with every case I get?

833
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:57,832
That would be cool.

834
00:40:58,178 --> 00:41:00,066
No, Charlie,
it would not be cool.

835
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:01,788
I don't like being crazy.

836
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:02,789
You're not crazy.

837
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,094
You just have
an active imagination.

838
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:08,172
I mean, you're always going on
about how you wanna be a writer.

839
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:09,765
That's what writers do,
right?

840
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:10,669
They create characters.

841
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,614
Yeah, but do they
actually see 'em?

842
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,780
No. And if they do, they're...
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

843
00:41:16,693 --> 00:41:19,915
Well, maybe it's just because
you need someone to talk to.

844
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:23,148
Without me in your car,
you've got no one

845
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:24,704
to bounce your ideas off of.

846
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,249
Yeah.

847
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:27,902
Maybe I should get
a new partner?

848
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,014
Please. Who is gonna
partner with you?

849
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:33,565
Why? 'Cause I'm crazy?

850
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:34,788
Because you're a jerk.

851
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:36,364
I'm rubber, you're glue.

852
00:41:36,365 --> 00:41:38,169
Whatever you say,
bounces off me, sticks to you.

853
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,447
It's not so bad,
is it?

854
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:42,278
You solved her murder,
she went away.

855
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:43,476
Yeah.

856
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:45,991
But if more of them
come along, you positive

857
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:47,473
that they'll
disappear every time?

858
00:41:47,483 --> 00:41:48,286
Yep.

859
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:50,731
It didn't happen
the first time, now did it?

860
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:53,534
And I caught that killer.
In fact, I put a bullet in his eye.

861
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,070
And you're still here.

862
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,653
Maybe because I'm here for
a different reason, Michael.

863
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:01,901
Like what?

864
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:03,406
I don't know.

865
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:07,047
Guess you're gonna have
to figure that out.

866
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:09,497
One thing that's been bugging me.

867
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:11,526
Why do you have me
walking around with this cane?

868
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,329
'Cause you got shot,
it seemed right.

869
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,052
Yeah, if I got shot
in the leg.

870
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,285
I got capped
in the noggin.

871
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,435
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but I didn't feel

872
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,844
like looking at you
with a, you know,

873
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:20,845
hole in your head.

874
00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:23,999
Lose the cane.
Wanna lose the cane?

875
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Thank you.

876
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,112
Yeah, lose the cane.

877
00:42:31,706 --> 00:42:32,706
Hey.

878
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,143
Who were you talking to?

879
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:37,866
The dead.

880
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:41,879
They hunger for human brains.

881
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:44,015
The feasting
will begin at sundown.

882
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:50,086
Jerk.

883
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:51,933
I know.
