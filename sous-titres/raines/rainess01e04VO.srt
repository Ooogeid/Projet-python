1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,170
human beings have the longest period of helplessness of any animal.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,810
Fish and reptiles are born ready to survive on their own.Mice are ready in days.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,960
Granted,mice only live for a few months,so for mouse parents,a day probably seems like an eternity.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,850
Anyway,my point is,scientists say our childhoods are longer 'cause we need to learn more to survive.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,850
I think it's 'cause we're the only animal

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,320
that's aware of its own limitations,chiefly among those being,of course,death.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,170
And in return,we get bonus innocence time.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,490
When you're a child,you believe everything is possible because,in a sense,it is.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,660
When you're 10,everybody actually has a shot at being bill gates.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,540
Well,not--not everybody.

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,810
When you're a kid,you believe you're an invincible,all-powerful being and the world

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,240
that revolves around you has an absolute order,

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,360
where good always triumphs over evil and everything makes sense.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,720
Unless your father was a cop killed in a shoot-out with a drug dealer.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,880
my mom cries sometimes.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,350
She goes in her room,but I can hear her.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,670
Really?Well,she misses your dad.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,000
I miss him too.Sometimes crying makes you feel better,you know?

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,470
You killed the guy that killed my dad,huh?

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,680
Yes,jack,I did.

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,110
I wish I could've done it.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,660
some kids grow old too fast.

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,560
Some don't grow old at all.

24
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,460
he didn't go gently into that good night.

25
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,640
Stab wounds on both sides of the heart

26
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,680
Coroner's investigator estimates the time of death is midnight to 2 am.

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,590
No blood trail,so he was dead when he was brought here.

28
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,520
No money.College parking pass.There's also a photograph.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,270
I was thinking maybe it's his girlfriend.

30
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,620
We better find her and give her the bad news.Unless he was her stalker.In which case,it's good news.

31
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,640
Driver's license with a victorville address.

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,230
I bet I would've had cute kids.

33
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,570
And one day,maybe grandkids who'd put their tiny,little hands in mine.

34
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,400
Tell me all about their day.

35
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,050
That'd been nice.

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,990
how--how'd you find me?

37
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,180
Well,jimmy had a little picture of you in his wallet.

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,710
And his graphic design professor identified you.

39
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,640
How'd you guys meet,by the way,you and jimmy?

40
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,120
I was workin'on the coffee house at campus.

41
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,190
I just looked up,and there he was.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,390
All he said was "hey."

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,130
And this weird calm came over me,like I knew him all my life.What happened?

44
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,210
I'm trying to figure that out.You know,it could have been robbery,

45
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,340
but,uh,I gotta check all,all possibilities.

46
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,560
-Such as?
-Uh,such as,at school?

47
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,170
Anybody,anybody give him a problem there,maybe?

48
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,890
No.We didn't socialize much.Anytime we weren't together,he was doing his class work.He had a lot.

49
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,570
Yeah,I didn't realize you could,uh,go to college for--for,uh,comic books.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,890
He was taking psychology of perception.He was taking color theory,analysis of form.

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,640
So it was hard work,and he was really good.

52
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,000
Well,his teachers said that he was--he was really--he was talented.

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,690
Anybody else that you can think of who might have wanted to do him harm in any way?

54
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,900
From his past,maybe?Victorville?

55
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,630
He didn't like to talk about his past much.He was an orphan.

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,930
He never knew his mom.His dad died in desert storm when he was 5.

57
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,190
So he was raised by foster parents?

58
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,820
Group homes mostly.Every once in awhile...

59
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:54,220
I'd see a bad memory come on him.And then he'd just draw in his sketchbook,and he'd feel better.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,020
Uh,is there anybody else I can talk to about jimmy?

61
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,410
Yeah,wally.He was the closest thing to family that jimmy had.

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,680
Wally?What's his last name,

63
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,430
He's the guy that owns that comic book shop,the geek farm.

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,130
He used to be this big-shot comic book writer.

65
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,260
Jimmy would write him letters since he was a kid.

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,250
Wally was the one who convinced jimmy to come out here and go to college.

67
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,180
Jimmy was writing a comic book with him.

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,070
It was really cool.The hero was this guy called "payback."His family was murdered by the mob.

69
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,220
What you drawing there?

70
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,650
My newest superhero.

71
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,580
Captain raines.

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,940
And I like what you've done here.You've captured my enormous--enormous quads.

73
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,300
Me and jerome bettis.The bulge is a little modest,but you don't want to scare the children.

74
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,540
-I understand that.
-That's what I was thinkin'.

75
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,210
So I guess we both moved here to follow our dream.

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,330
Well,I came here 'cause I thought I was gonna be the next raymond chandler.

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,650
I thought if you live here,you write like him."Dead men are heavier than broken hearts."

78
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,640
The big sleep.Great book.

79
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,070
-Did you read that? 
-No,I doubt it.

80
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,160
So...you came to the city of angels to become a writer,and ended up a cop.

81
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,390
I came to become a comic book artist and I ended up dead.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,730
Nice try.It's a little hokey.

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,030
Don't blame me,man. I only exist in your head.

84
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,070
hey,pal.

85
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,660
Oh.No,no,no.Thank you.Not a--not a drunk.Just,uh...crazy.Thank you.

89
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,130
-I had this as a kid.
-How much is that worth now?

90
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,970
About half what it was worth before you touched it.

91
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,950
To be honest with you,I,I wasn't aware.

92
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,550
Um,and this one--this is $1,000?

93
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,390
And you can't even look on the inside of it?

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,800
People buy high-end comics as an investment,okay?

95
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,780
When you break that seal,you invalidate the grade that wally puts on it.

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,300
somebody wanna see me?

97
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,860
-Uh,wally? 
-Yeah?

98
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,310
I'm,uh,detective raines.I'm here about the jimmy davis murder.

99
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,250
Did he have any issues with,uh,co-workers or,or customers?

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,130
No.

101
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,040
Might he have been involved in anything that,uh,could have gotten him killed?

102
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,440
kids are stupid.Maybe he put himself at the wrong place at the wrong time.

103
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,270
You're freakishly tall.Why don't you put that up there for me.

104
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,180
"Freakishly tall."You're too kind.

105
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,220
-Um,was he workin'the night he died?
-Yeah,yeah.

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,830
-Did he say where he was going after?
-Nope.

107
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,050
Wally,this guy saw the ravensclaw death saber on the website.

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,010
He wants to know if he comes in,can he get it cheaper?

109
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,570
Tell him if he comes into the store,I have to charge him more because then I have to look at his big fat face.

110
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,560
See,everything here is on the website.I don't even need a shop anymore.

111
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,350
And one of these days,I'm just locking the door.

112
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,220
Hey,I was talking to his girlfriend,and,uh,she said that,uh,for jimmy,you were like a--you were like a father figure.

113
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,460
These kids are so screwed up,so starved for attention,

114
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,850
you pat 'em on the head,they wanna move in with ya.

115
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:52,040
Okay,well,thanks so much for your time,wally.Here's my card.

116
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,440
If you think of anything,please just give me a call.Oh,and,uh...if I may.Thanks.

117
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,350
I never figured you for a betty and veronica fan.

118
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,010
a man can dream.

119
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,000
Welcome to my home.

120
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,650
Cheese puff?

121
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,900
No,thanks.

122
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,960
Check this out.

123
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,730
Come on.

124
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,250
Payback.

125
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,470
It's this guy who commits suicide after his family's killed by the mob.

126
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,780
But after he's buried,he's reanimated when hazardous waste leaches into his grave.

127
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,160
I know the story.I was there when jolie told me.

128
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,270
Yeah,but,see,it's really cool.He's invulnerable because he's already dead.

129
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,930
And he stays that way by ingesting toxic waste.

130
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,580
Ooh,that lunch box is gonna be a big,uh,big seller.

131
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,260
the turtle's unarmed.Don't shoot.

132
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,700
-What is that,a tortoise?
-Heh.

133
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,800
That's amazing.

134
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,090
Did...I get killed here?

135
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,310
Well,there's no forced entry,no sign of struggle,no visible blood.What is this?

136
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,160
Nice bong.

137
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,680
I'm as surprised as you are,man.

138
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,580
Well sure,now the tortoise makes sense.

139
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,040
It's the only pet that you can catch when you're stoned.

140
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,840
Weed loosens me up to sketch.

141
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:38,910
"5-year-old calls 911 as father overdoses."Not a war hero,quite.

142
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,800
I...

143
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,280
couldn't save him.

144
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,980
I always blamed myself.

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,230
You know how that feels.

146
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,900
What is this?A locked cabinet.What's in here?

147
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,210
Bro,if it's one of those rubber suits with a zipper for the mouth,let's keep it on the down-low.

148
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,960
That's a lot of marijuana.

149
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,490
I have a serious drug problem.

150
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,390
No,you're a dealer.And that will definitely get you killed.

151
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,210
Shouldn't I be different now that you found out I was a drug dealer?

152
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,680
I don't know for sure you were dealing.There could be other reasons the drugs were in there.

153
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,860
-Like what?
-I'm working.

154
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,510
You didn't answer my question.

155
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,710
Quiet time.

156
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,300
Michael raines,lapd.

157
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,090
Your move,sweetie.

158
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,490
Jimmy was such a nice boy.

159
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,700
He helped me get my medicine for my glaucoma.

160
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,700
Yeah,is it possible that for right now we could put your medicine out?

161
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,370
Could you put it out?

162
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,900
Your candy dish.Hey,did you know any of the people who came over to jimmy's,customers or--or friends?

163
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,950
Is that cat breathing?

164
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,990
Oh,I hope not.She died years ago.I had her stuffed.

165
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,730
Stuffed.Oh,like roy rogers with trigger.

166
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,630
Norman bates did that--taxidermy.

167
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,590
That's the highest form of flattery,isn't it?

168
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,570
"Impersonation."

169
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,000
"Impersonation."I think you're right.

170
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,610
Did jimmy have any problems with anybody lately?

171
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,380
Well,last week,he...

172
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,050
last week...?

173
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,360
I'm not a mind-reader.What about last week?

174
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,380
Is it old age or the weed?

175
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,530
Old age put her on the bicycle,but the weed's doing the pedaling.

176
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,230
I don't peddle drugs.I'm a consumer.

177
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,040
Now let's get back to the argument with sergei.

178
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,860
Sergei?Jimmy had an argument with somebody named sergei?

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,930
You are a lightweight,aren't you,dear?

180
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,030
Yes.Jimmy had an argument out in the hall with sergei.

181
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,780
That's the guy who owns the smoke shop.

182
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,860
He's a nasty man,but,oh-ho,wonderful bongs.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,370
Yeah,what was the argument about,do you know?

184
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:28,080
Well,something about jimmy owing sergei some money and--do you think he killed jimmy?

185
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,370
I'm gonna make sure to ask him that.

186
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,920
Um,margo,you have been a world of help,really.

187
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,490
I thank you so,so much for your time.

188
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,090
I really appreciate it.

189
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,330
These are for you.

190
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,570
-What are those,cookies?
-No,no.

191
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,540
Shoes.

192
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,650
They were my anthony'S.

193
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,160
He was a big man,like you.

194
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:56,200
He walked everywhere.He loved seeing the city.He was a good man.

195
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,000
Well,I'll,I'll take good care of them.

196
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:06,140
Here,I got you something.Look at that.I don't know if ya like the girls.Betty and veronica.

197
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,130
-It's great.
-You hate it.

198
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,070
No.I'm just more into ghost rider right now.

199
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,750
Ghost rider?Oh,okay.Ghost rider.I'll remember.

200
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,340
Hey,you want some ice cream from the truck?

201
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,490
-If you want to.
-Ooh,I'd love to.That's my favorite--

202
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,960
favorite thing:Getting food where it comes to you.

203
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,570
It's,uh,what it must have been like to be a prehistoric hunter.

204
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,760
See,that's the giant ground sloth,and we're creeping up on it until,just the right moment,

205
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,010
when we spring forward and rip our nourishment out of the belly of the beast.

206
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,080
Of course,that's only after paying and getting our napkins.

207
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,060
My dad said you were funny.

208
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,260
Yeah,well,I'm more of a physical comedian.

209
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,510
I'm what you call,"on funny."Some people are regular funny.

210
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,190
I'm on funny.That's from a movie. What are you gonna get?

211
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,010
My eye has fallen upon eskimo munch.That sounds vaguely inappropriate.

212
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,530
Here,I'm torn between choco-nut,which is festive,and purple tongues.I never heard of that.

213
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,550
Very--that's intriguing.

214
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,000
But I'm literally torn.I'm ripped in half.We may need some,uh--

215
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,010
hey,you okay?

216
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,810
Someone said my dad's in a better place now.

217
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,660
How come the best place wasn't with me and my mom?

218
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,660
-Remember?
-It's pizza night.

219
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,580
I'm not hungry.

220
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,650
what?I'll eat that pizza.I like your famous pizza.

221
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,370
Thank you so much for picking him up.

222
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,690
-Sit,please.
-Oh,thank you.

223
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,510
Ah,how's jury duty?

224
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,710
Oh,I'm not supposed to talk about it.

225
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,000
He's guilty.

226
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,440
How you doin'?

227
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm cursing god less.

228
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,690
Well,don't stop completely,you know.

229
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,100
I'm sure it's a welcome change from all those people,uh,sucking up and asking for stuff,you know.

230
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,160
Jack got into another fight at school.

231
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,180
He is so angry at the world.

232
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,700
Well,the world hasn't been too great to him,you know.

233
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,440
How are you?

234
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,740
Still talking to the victims?

235
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,220
Charlie told me you did that.

236
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,790
Oh.Yeah,yeah.Well,it's,uh,different without charlie.

237
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,770
In what way?

238
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,000
Uh,it's hard to put into words.

239
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,840
let's talk about your case.

240
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,750
-You like this victim.
-Like him?

241
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
You identify with him.

242
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,000
Talking with jimmy,the young artist,puts you in touch with your creative self.

243
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,960
You know,I feel bad for him.

244
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,480
He had to watch his own father O.D. Right in front of him.

245
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,180
Hmm,that would be pretty devastating.

246
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,880
Oof.

247
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,180
You know,he had nobody to look out for him.

248
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,880
Of course his life turned to crap.

249
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,820
You seem angry.

250
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,800
Well,did this idiot think for one second what it would do to his kid?

251
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,760
You know,what kind of selfish father does something that he knows that sooner or later is gonna kill him?

252
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,270
Charlie.

253
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,330
What?

254
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,790
He lived a life he knew might kill him,and now that he's gone,you feel responsible for jack.

255
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,240
He's been getting into fights at school lately.

256
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,580
Children of homicide victims have a lot of rage.

257
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,050
Sometimes I wish I could just,uh,reach in and take that pain out of him.

258
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,400
Even if you could,I don't think you'd have any room left.

259
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,700
Can we leave me out of it,please?

260
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,760
Okay. Well,this has been,uh,just the best time I've ever had in my whole life.

261
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,890
You know,jack is showing signs of childhood traumatic grief.

262
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,930
He can't mourn the loss of his father because any thoughts of him,

263
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,000
even the happy ones,remind him of the terrifying way in which he died.

264
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,620
If that's true,how do I handle it?

265
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
Bring him in here.

266
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,680
-In here?
-Yeah.I might be able to help.

267
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,200
I've worked with kids before.

268
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,580
I don't know if he's gonna want to talk about it.

269
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,430
Well,I've also worked with people who are here against their will.

270
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,760
-What'd you get for lunch?
-Shoes.

271
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,790
That smart-ass attitude is exactly why you'll never get to have a captain's ulcer.

272
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,270
No,a very sweet doper old lady gave these to me.

273
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,150
Uh,they belonged to her dead husband.

274
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,870
She thought they'd fit me.You're an 11,aren't ya?

275
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,090
I'm good for shoes.

276
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,610
What I could really use,though,is some old dead guy pants.

277
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,760
Really?Is this cordovan or oxblood?They go with everything.

278
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,870
I'm a 12,but a 15 feels so good.

279
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,520
How'd it go with samantha today?

280
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,260
Uh,we had a breakthrough,as a matter of fact.My problem is you.

281
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,660
I ask because I care.

282
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,150
And I want a heads up when you snap so I have time to find a place to take a clean shot from.

283
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,570
You'll spare me,right?

284
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,090
You'll need someone to explain the insane logic behind the rampage.

285
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,150
I'm writing a note.

286
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,910
Hey,I hear you've been hangin' with jack. How's that goin'?

287
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,330
Is everything all right?

288
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,810
Uh,I've been picking him up after school.

289
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,170
Lisa's on jury duty.

290
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,780
Is he still having a tough time?

291
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,390
I'm gonna try to get him to see,uh,samantha.

292
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,840
Well,give him my love.

293
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,890
-You know anybody?
-No.

294
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,030
Anything new on your doper murder?

295
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,070
I'm gonna grab boyer.We're going over to a head shop and interviewing this guy.

296
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,230
Does anybody still call them head shops?

297
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,700
I wouldn't know.I drink.

298
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,880
Never seen him before.

299
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm sorry.I probably should have started with the fact that we have a witness

300
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,220
who puts you last week at his apartment arguing with him--jimmy.

301
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,160
Must be different belo-russian.We all look alike.

302
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,570
Uh,maybe you didn't mean to kill him.Maybe,uh,uh,maybe jimmy didn't pay you for the smoke,

303
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,710
he rushed at you,you moved aside,and then he fell on a knife that you were holding.Twice.

304
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,700
I have nothing to do with drugs.This is tobacco accessories shop.Now I have business.

305
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,040
-Good-bye.
-Uh,okay.

306
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,060
Boyer,I asked you to meet me at the shop.

307
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,970
Oh,there you are.

308
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,970
The dog can't walk?

309
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,810
It's not threatening if you're carrying it.

310
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,430
look,all the other working dogs were,well,uh,working.

311
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,860
This is sadie.She's retired.

312
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,140
Did you have the cookies?

313
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,980
You have no respect.

314
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,410
This is no time for you to get defensive.

315
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,150
All right,here we go.

316
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,560
Okay,everybody,

317
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,410
listen up.

318
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,950
Let me introduce you to narcotics officer boyer and his,uh,k-9 partner...

319
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,970
sadie.

320
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,030
Sadie.

321
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,590
Um,no reason for alarm.

322
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,130
Unless you're carrying illegal substances.

323
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,210
What kind of crap is this?

324
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,000
go.

325
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,760
What's wrong with your dog?

326
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,270
You've gotta be kiddin'.

327
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,420
oh,boy,look--

328
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,570
look at that determination.

329
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,770
Nothin's gonna--nothin's gonna stop her.

330
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,710
It's illegal.

331
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,730
I don't have drugs here.

332
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,600
I'm not looking for drugs.

333
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,300
I'm destroying your shop.

334
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,410
That sounded expensive.

335
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,660
Okay,okay,stop the dog.

336
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,860
-Boyer.
-Yeah?

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,420
Oh,come here.

338
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,170
Come here,sadie.

339
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,590
That's a good sadie.Who's still got it,huh?

340
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,380
Sadie's still got it.

341
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,460
Tell me.

342
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,480
Jimmy owed me money.

343
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,540
For what?

344
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,370
What do you think?

345
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,020
But he paid me back couple days ago.

346
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,160
You just asked him politely,and he just paid you back?

347
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,530
There was some yelling.I'm emotional.

348
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,700
But I'm not stupid enough to kill a gangbanger.

349
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,210
Jimmy was a drug dealer.

350
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,250
Jimmy was shotcaller for the four-twenty mafia.

351
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,410
You got a problem,bitch?

352
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,550
Background and an address on the four-twenty mafia.

353
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,810
Uh-huh,why haven't I heard of these guys?

354
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,580
They just came down from victorville.Things got tense with the vagos.

355
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,750
These guys are a stoner gang,white,mostly into dealing weed,some extortion.

356
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,960
Our friendly neighborhood gangs can't be too thrilled with this.

357
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,360
You think he was taken out by locals?

358
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,360
Dope's all about market-share.

359
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,490
Glen bassett,25.Street name,surfer.He's the shot-caller now.

360
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,240
He just did a bid in corcoran for aggravated assault.

361
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,570
Aggravated assault?

362
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,190
What happened to the good old days when,uh,potheads used to just stay at home

363
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,540
and eat cookie dough and watch the,watch the shag carpet?

364
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,040
Michael raines,lapd.

365
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,420
Five-o!

366
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,210
I'm glenn.They call me surfer.

367
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,180
Hey,I thought you told everybody that I was coming over.

368
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,190
I did.Um,jerry's kind of self-winding.

369
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,140
Okay,gentlemen,I'm investigating the murder of your friend jimmy davis.

370
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,340
Jimmy's dead?

371
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,670
I told you he died.

372
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,590
I know.I just said he was dead.

373
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,430
You said it like a question.

374
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,880
No,I didn't just say it like it was a question.

375
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,500
yes,you did.You went up at the end,like,"jimmy's dead?"

376
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,620
Okay,now that we've established that,let me ask ya:

377
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,530
Any of you guys know anybody who might have wanted to harm jimmy?

378
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,860
Everybody liked jimmy,man.

379
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,290
Everybody?

380
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,800
Shoreline boys?

381
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,470
Culver city bloods?

382
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:08,020
Did they like jimmy as much as the vagos liked you in victorville?

383
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,990
What--what's happening here?

384
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,030
You look like dizzy gillespie there.

385
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,230
Don't hold that in on my account.

386
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,130
There you go.That's healthier.

387
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,490
Uh,all right.Not with me.Not with me.Let me c right to the chase.

388
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,070
I think jimmy may have been killed 'cause you guys took over the local weed trade.

389
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,380
If this is a gang thing,they ain't gonna stop with jimmy.

390
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,440
No,you don't get it,man.

391
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,810
Jimmy was like my brother,man.

392
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,330
This is not a gang.

393
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,200
It's a family.We take care of each other.

394
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,690
Don't be stupid.There are what,five of you guys?

395
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,350
If this is a gang thing,you're gonna have,uh,50 homeboys each to deal with.

396
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,230
Give me a name.

397
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,710
Throwing the competition in jail is gonna be good for business.

398
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,920
All right,tre.

399
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,480
From the rolling fifties.

400
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,790
What about him?

401
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,000
Him and jimmy had got into a beef a little while ago.

402
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,010
You got a last name?

403
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,390
He shouldn't be too hard to spot.

404
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,540
He's got a real specific smile.

405
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,920
hey,I bet I can,uh guess which one of you is tre.

406
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,140
Hey,what do they call a,a cow with no legs?

407
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,400
Ground beef.

408
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,160
Here,watch this.I can wiggle one ear at a a time.WatcH.

409
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,700
hey,tre.There you are.

410
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,370
Hello.I gotcha.

411
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,890
You thought I didn't see ya now,did ya?

412
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,240
You're kinda out there for a cop.

413
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,840
You have no idea.

414
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,920
So,uh,I'm investigating the murder of jimmy davis.

415
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,810
Hey,me and jimmy had a few issues,but I didn't kill nobody.

416
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,740
He was on your turf dealing weed.

417
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,780
Maybe one of your crew did it to send a message?

418
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,200
Why would I cap him?

419
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,530
Jimmy was the only one of those fools with half a brain.

420
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,600
The rest of them stay blazed 24/7.

421
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,240
-What about surfer? 
-What about surfer?

422
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,260
Surfer's the muscle.He ain't a man of respect.

423
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,920
So you just let four-twenty deal on your streets?

424
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,440
You didn't get those teeth being,uh,mr. Charity.

425
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,810
You should get,like,a gold cap,with like a diamond bullet.

426
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,550
That'd be hot,man.

427
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,890
It's on my hanukkah list.

428
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,730
So,uh,convince me you had nothing to do with jimmy's death.

429
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,980
Look,man,they started dealing on my block.

430
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,540
But I knew jimmy was smarter than that.

431
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,380
So I told him what'd happen if he continued.

432
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,980
I used my words.

433
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,170
He just stopped.

434
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,670
I guess they was the right words.

435
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,000
Then how did they pay off sergei?

436
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,990
Look,man,I don't know.If you don't believe me what I'm tellin' you,ask jimmy's girl.

437
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,370
She was at the sit-down.

438
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,280
-Jolie?
-Yeah.

439
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,660
She knew that jimmy was in a gang?

440
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,550
Seemed like she knew everything.

441
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,830
Look,man,are we done?

442
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,490
I got a t-ball game to catch.My girl's batting a 500.

443
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,050
You're not gonna call him on that?

444
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,480
It's a ball on a stand.

445
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,440
How do you miss half the time?

446
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,280
500?That's--that's really great.

447
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,120
Yeah,I know.

448
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,500
Coward.

449
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,650
I didn't want to bring him down.

450
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,820
Carolyn,

451
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,880
I gotta go pick up jack.

452
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,270
Track down jolie right away.

453
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,150
Call her house,call her work,call her mother if you have to,but get her down here.Thank you so much.

454
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,410
Oh,wait--wait!Here.

455
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,770
-What is that?
-Oh,thanks a bunch.

456
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,210
No,the only kind of candy I eat is,uh,saltwater taffy from atlantic city.

457
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,500
It's for jack.

458
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,720
Charlie used to always get them for him out of the machine.

459
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,260
You're a very nice lady.

460
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,690
Eh,I've been told.

461
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,490
You can still win.

462
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,620
First get ultimate dragon and black warrior magician in face-up attack positions.

463
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,060
Then you equip the incredible fireball to handel the iron knight.

464
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,900
I have no idea what you're talking about.

465
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,920
I have no idea what that means.

466
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,540
But here's a one-handed--here's a one-handed shuffle.

467
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,690
What do you think of that?

468
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,870
Okay,okay.

469
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,290
Um...

470
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,190
if there was something that you could do to make yourself feel better about,um,your dad,

471
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,240
would you do-- would you do that,ever?

472
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,310
I don't know.Maybe.

473
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,140
Really?

474
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,420
Well,I've got this,friend,a very nice lady,who helps people by talking to them.

475
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,420
She's really smart,and she's,you know,made a lotta--lotta people feel better.

476
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,710
Did she make you feel better?

477
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,760
Yes,sir.

478
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
You suck at lying.

479
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,890
Well...I don't know what to say to get you to at least try this.

480
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,910
So I tell you what,what if I just buy you something?

481
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,100
Could I have cash instead?

482
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,490
No,you can't have cash.

483
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,590
Hi,pal.

484
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,140
You have fun?

485
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,690
Raines' gonna buy me something.

486
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,750
he'll make a great dad someday.

487
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,050
-Give us a second,okay,sweetie?
-Okay.

488
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,890
Okay.

489
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,830
Thank you again.

490
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,710
So,um...

491
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,690
you think this woman can really help jack?

492
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,880
Uh,yeah,I do.

493
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,410
I'm always on call.

494
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,830
Hello?

495
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,210
I have jolie in interrogation.

496
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,620
Yeah,good.I'll be right there.

497
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,810
if we don't solve a case in the first 48 hours,the chances that we ever solve it go down by half.

498
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,520
How come you didn't tell me the truth?

499
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,960
I didn't want you to write jimmy off as some gangbanger who had it coming.

500
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,970
I don't work that way.

501
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,990
I'm sorry.

502
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,640
How long had jimmy been in a gang?

503
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,630
Since he was 12.

504
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,520
He said they made him feel like he belonged somewhere.

505
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,820
How long had he been the shot-caller?

506
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,850
A couple of years.

507
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,090
He never wanted it.

508
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,060
It just sort of happened.

509
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,080
People just followed him.

510
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,240
He wanted out of that life,

511
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,170
so he--he came here?

512
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,910
Yeah.

513
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:23,140
I mean,wally gave him the confidence to believe that he had the talent to be somebody.

514
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,110
You know,he stopped getting high.

515
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,090
He put all of his effort into school.

516
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,440
But...the gang was lost without him.

517
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,840
And what?They followed him down here?

518
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,000
Jimmy told them not to.

519
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:41,730
He told them that he was done,but then surfer got the russian guy to front them the dope.

520
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,490
Jimmy just held onto it because he knew that they were gonna smoke it.

521
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:53,420
And then tre shut him down...before jimmy could sell it.

522
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,820
So where did jimmy get the money to pay back sergei?

523
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,010
I don't know.

524
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,720
Jolie,don't lie to me.

525
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,780
However he got that money might have gotten him killed.

526
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,620
He had some comics that were worth a lot of money,and he was gonna sell one of them.

527
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,780
Where did he get the comics?

528
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,840
oh,come on,you know.

529
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,130
You just don't want to admit it.

530
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,350
I ripped off wally.

531
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,830
You said he was going to sell one of them?

532
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,450
What did he do with the rest of them?

533
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,110
He asked me to hold onto them for him.

534
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,500
so the forensic artist's secret,uh,secret lair.

535
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,110
One.

536
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,150
Wow,you did these?

537
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,240
Yeah,why are you so surprised?

538
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,570
They're good.

539
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,900
Two.

540
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,450
-One what? Two what?
-Two slams.

541
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,440
Third strike,you're out.You want my help or not?

542
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,050
Yeah,mr. Sensitive,I do.

543
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,220
I mean,I'm an artist.I'm not a big time collector.

544
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,880
You should have gone to somebody who grades comics.

545
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:55,930
Like wally anderson?

546
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,900
Yeah.

547
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,930
stanley,who do you have out there?

548
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,710
Nobody,ma. Go back to sleep.

549
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,230
Here,let me see 'em.

550
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,060
how much?

551
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,150
Normally 5k apiece.

552
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,210
Normally?

553
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,390
These are worthless.They're fakes.

554
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,280
I don't like having strangers in the house.

555
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,790
Just say hi to her.

556
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,920
Hello,mrs. Rastow.

557
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,670
It's,uh,michael--michael raines.

558
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,640
How were they faked?

559
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,970
Scanned from an original,dropped out the color,recolored with an eyedropper--

560
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,280
that's a bitch and a half--calendared paper,a little matte finish spray to give it that re-glossing pop.

561
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,600
who?

562
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,590
Raines,the tall one from the P.B.A. Picnic with the shoulders you like.

563
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,020
Your mother has the hots for me?

564
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,210
She's losing her mind.

565
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,090
Thus these shoulders are much admired.

566
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,380
That doesn't make any sense.

567
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,720
I'll give you the telephone numbers of several women.

568
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,330
The comics don't make any sense.

569
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,440
Oh.I'm sorry.How so?

570
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,790
Well,the covers are impressive,but the guts are a hack job.

571
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,230
Anybody who'd throw thousands at a comic would take one look at the splash page and know it's tweaked.

572
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,030
What if they were graded and slabbed?

573
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,130
That'd work.

574
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,380
But graders are like freakin' priests.

575
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,350
There's no way they'd certify a fake.

576
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,920
The comics came in these.

577
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,170
Wally's selling knockoffs?That's impossible.

578
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,770
The guy's like a jedi-level nerd.

579
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,370
He'd never go to the dark side.

580
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,560
Unless somebody forced him to.

581
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,670
okay,wally's website.

582
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,960
"Lord of the rings,harry potter"-- no.

583
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,210
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait."Fantasy weapons,daggers"--ooh,wait a minute.

584
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:34,370
Bring that one up right there."The dragon's fangs."

585
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,320
I didn't see that one in wally's store.

586
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,740
They make two wounds.

587
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,660
We thought jimmy was stabbed twice.Maybe not.

588
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,970
Maybe wally hit me once with this.

589
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,860
I need a want and warrant on wally anderson.

590
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,420
Murder.

591
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,590
No.

592
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,730
'Cause you fired him?

593
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,150
Yeah.

594
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,560
Why?

595
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,900
Because of these.

596
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,210
You thought you could turn his screwed-up life around.

597
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,560
So you gave him a job,you encouraged him,you worked on a comic book together.

598
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,040
You treated him like a son,and he repaid you with those.

599
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,870
You don't understand--

600
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,480
he knew that selling those could ruin your reputation,your business.

601
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,970
Everything you worked your whole life to build,he was willing to destroy.

602
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,690
-Jimmy was a good kid. 
-But it was too late to save him.

603
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,550
The damage was too deep.

604
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,610
That's not true!

605
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,050
He played you.He used you.

606
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,580
Just stop it!

607
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,080
It was those other losers that made jimmy copy these comics.

608
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,230
How did you find that out?

609
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,660
Because...

610
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,150
they sold one to a collector in van nuys,

611
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,830
who,of course,was able to tell that these were fakes,traced them back to me.

612
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,530
And you connected it to jimmy?

613
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:01,030
Yeah,when I confronted jimmy about it,he told me about the drug debt.

614
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,260
So I told him I would pay the money if he would destroy the rest of the comicS.

615
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,970
What else happened that night?

616
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,360
What did you say to jimmy?

617
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,940
I told him I never wanted to see him again.

618
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,170
And I never did.

619
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,420
Can I look yet?

620
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,950
Okay.

621
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,550
I wish I could draw.

622
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:37,530
Oh,that's really great.Wow,I like all the action.

623
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,450
Thank you.

624
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,260
Can you tell me all the stuff that's going on?

625
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,620
Okay,this is an evil robot with eight arms,kind of like doc ock,

626
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,460
but not human at all.

627
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,160
He's about to attack this kid who's sleeping.

628
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,430
Well,it's gonna be kinda hard for the kid to fight back because the robot blends into the darkness here.

629
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,540
It's a trap,see?This kid is not a real kid.

630
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,290
It's a bomb in the shape of a kid.

631
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,080
That's cool.

632
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,040
Could you make me one where the bomb-kid blows up the robot?

633
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,260
That wouldn't really happen.

634
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm kind of tired right now.

635
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,900
Okay.

636
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,130
Well,we're,uh,a little bit early.Your mom's not home yet.

637
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,830
Wanna come up here with me?Slide up here with me.

638
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,810
Sit in the big boy's chair.There you go.

639
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:31,300
Yeah,put your big shoes all over my--there you go.

640
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,140
There you go.

641
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,840
So you're not gonna say anything?

642
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,810
About what?

643
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,370
You know about what.

644
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,240
You just saw samantha.Tell me.How'd it go?

645
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,350
She said I didn't have to tell anyone.

646
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:47,070
Oh,that's right.Well,you don'T.You're,you're,you're absolutely right.

647
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,810
You know,I remember the day you were born?

648
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,900
Your dad put on the siren and the big lights and raced over to the station.

649
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,640
He wanted to show us pictures of you.

650
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,120
He thought you were the most beautiful thing that he'd ever seen in his whole life.

651
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,730
I saw those pictures.

652
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,450
I was all puffy with a pointy head.

653
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,410
That's what I said.Yes,you were.

654
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,380
He was so proud of you,your dad,you know.

655
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,900
You know what he said?

656
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,520
He said,uh,he was a good man,but that you were gonna grow up to be a great man.

657
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,500
that's why you won't let me change.

658
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,230
If you keep me nice jimmy,you don't have to deal with the thought that I went bad because I didn't have a father.

659
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,520
Hey,how about some,uh,music?

660
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,080
Because charlie's dead,

661
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,690
you're afraid the same thing will happen to jack if you don't step up and do something.

662
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,280
But you don't think you're up to it.

663
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,890
That's kinda loud!

664
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,350
Don't you kids like the music loud?Come on--

665
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,830
That's really bad for your ears,man.

666
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,330
answer me one question,I'll shut up.

667
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,830
Where's charlie?

668
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,980
He's in your head like I'm in your head,right?

669
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,830
You've been with jack all week.

670
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,720
So don't you think charlie--the charlie in your head--don't you think

671
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,810
if he was worried about you taking care of jack,don't you think you'd be seeing him every second of the day?

672
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,250
Samantha said I didn't have to talk,that I could just draw.

673
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,560
I knew what she was doing,but it was okay because I know the truth comes out when you draw.

674
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,620
What are you doing?

675
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,600
I'm betting that whoever killed you is in here.

676
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,030
In here where?

677
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,240
In here.

678
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,530
There we go.There we go.

679
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,360
Wally?

680
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,790
What's going on?

681
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,260
Uh,look at this.

682
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:27,050
These are panels that jimmy did before he died for that comic book that you guys were workin' on,payback?

683
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,020
He was the artist.

684
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,080
You were the writer.

685
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,560
Tell me the story of these panels.

686
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,790
I can'T.These are new. We never discussed this.

687
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,710
Well,give it a try.

688
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,180
Just,just give it a try.

689
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,760
payback is being attacked by an evil force,some sort of dark sea creature.

690
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,880
But he refuses to submit.

691
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,990
The evil force threatens to destroy an elder.

692
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,330
Now,you see the way the elder's drawn sympathetically.

693
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,490
This is someone that payback cares about.

694
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,740
Okay.

695
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,770
Here...

696
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,670
payback is making himself stronger.

697
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,450
He armors himself.

698
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,920
He goes after the evil force.

699
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,760
He attacks it.

700
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,990
He attacks it.Attacks it...

701
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,700
all right,listen to this.I'm gonna do another version.

702
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,000
Only this time,payback is jimmy.

703
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:37,030
A dark force is puttin'the squeeze on jimmy because somebody wants those copies from jimmy of the comics.

704
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,200
He threatened to come after the sympathetic elder.

705
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,880
Which is you.

706
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,260
Look at the beard.

707
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,690
Look how scared.

708
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,380
In this one,he's ingesting the toxic waste.

709
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,400
For the first time in six months jimmy got high.

710
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,520
He armors himself.

711
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,510
He comes in here and steals the knife.

712
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,820
And then he went after the dark force,which he drew as a sea creature,

713
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,900
because he thought it would be too on the nose if he just drew...surfer.

714
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,320
It had to be surfer.

715
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,990
Surfer was the muscle,the violent one,and he was a lot stronger than jimmy.

716
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,350
And while jimmy was the smart one,that night he was stoned out of his mind.

717
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:25,570
And so it ended,not the way it does in comics,but the way it often does in real life.

718
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,350
Okay,okay,he was stoned.

719
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:35,630
But what I don't understand is,if he knows the guy is dangerous,why does he go after him?

720
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,760
To protect you.

721
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,350
You were the closest thing that he had to a dad,wally.

722
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,900
Oh,no.

723
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,530
Can you get this bastard?

724
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:08,490
Hey,guys.Um...do you guys have any idea why we brought you down?

725
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm,I'm hungry,man.

726
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Uh,munchies later.Why are you here?Why are you here?

727
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,660
Where's surfer?

728
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,970
That's a good question.

729
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,620
Why am I here?

730
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,000
'Cause you're special.

731
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,880
I,uh--I know you guys have a code where you don't like to talk

732
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,910
to cops and tell 'em anything,so here's what we're gonna do.

733
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,450
I'll tell you what I think,and if I'm right,you don't say anything.

734
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:33,940
Jimmy was counterfeiting comics,surfer saw that there was big money in it,

735
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,660
pushed him to do more,and when jimmy refused,he was killed.

736
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,680
You don't even know what you're talkin' about,bro.

737
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,580
Okay,uh,here.

738
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,760
Do any of you guys,uh,ever wonder why jimmy quit smokin' pot?

739
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,930
The best as we could figure,he had some kind of mental breakdown or something.

740
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,050
-Man,I don't know.
-Breakdown--no.

741
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,350
Six months ago,we busted him for possession.

742
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,860
Jimmy was an informant.

743
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,710
jimmy wasn't a narc.

744
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,080
What is this,man?

745
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,580
If I tell you,it'll spoil the ending.

746
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,300
...Not that he was gonna flip on you,'cause he refused to do that.

747
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:10,070
Your problem is that the night that he was killed,jimmy was wearing a wire.

748
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,540
Aw,don't listen to him,man.

749
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,420
Shut up!

750
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,210
-They can't hear you.
-but even if he was,

751
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,270
we're not on that.

752
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,730
well,the voices are very hard to hear on there,

753
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,320
but lucky for us,surfer's gonna testify that all you guys killed him.

754
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,010
He's lying!Don't say anything,man!

755
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,620
Shut up!

756
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,770
What was that?

757
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,140
That's,uh,our captain beating a confession out of somebody,probably.

758
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,160
We had nothin' to do with jimmy dyin'.

759
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,000
See,there's something really interesting about this tape.

760
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,720
You can hear jimmy just fighting,fighting for his life real hard.

761
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,940
I guess 'cause for the first time in his life,he'd found something to live for.

762
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:50,450
But then at the end,it gets real,real quiet,and I swear,you can hear jimmy breathin' his last breath.

763
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,870
-Listen to this.
-no!

764
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,620
We didn't kill jimmy.

765
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,140
Surfer,he--he did it on his own,man.

766
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,000
-He's a putz,man.
-We got him.

767
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,840
We didn't even know until after,when he came home with hisis arm all bleeding.

768
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:04,710
Why was he bleeding?

769
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,730
Jimmy hit him once with a knife.

770
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,710
Let's see what's on the arm.

771
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,650
That looks like it hurts,sweetie.

772
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,010
Hey,I can give you the murder weapon.

773
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,220
Surfer told you to dump it.

774
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,650
It's a collectible,man.

775
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,130
Why do you always hit me?

776
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,530
They're gonna like you where you're goin'.

777
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,480
You're kinda cute.Wear your hair up.

778
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,970
dark horse says they might want to publish it.

779
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,430
They're trying to decide if it'll sell.

780
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,790
hmm,what do you think?Is it cool?

781
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,300
It's tight.

782
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,200
It'll sell.

783
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,100
Jimmy would have loved this.

784
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,130
Hey,have you seen the cover he was working on?

785
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,870
He never showed me a cover.

786
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,440
Come here.Come here.Come here.

787
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,610
Does the beautiful archangel remind you of anyone?

788
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,730
He never told me.

789
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,080
See,I told you he wasn't a bad guy.

790
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,060
Jolie,I never,I never doubted it for a second.

791
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,270
Can I have this one?

792
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:33,470
You certainly can.That's gonna be yours.And I'm gonna buy you the,uh,my favorite when I was a kid:Tiny mighty titan.

793
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,140
-Look at that.
-That's okay.

794
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,260
I'll just get mine.

795
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,380
Wait a minute.What's wrong with my superhero?

796
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,670
He's kind of lame.

797
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,570
Okay,I'm buying it,and I'm making you read it out loud unless--

798
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,610
here--you can come grab it from me.

799
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,670
You can'T. Nope!

800
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,320
come on.Let's get out of here.

801
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,380
Where are we goin'?

802
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,390
To the movies.

803
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,950
We're going to the movies?
