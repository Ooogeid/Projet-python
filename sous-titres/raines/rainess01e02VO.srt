1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,560
We have this, uh, forensic artist,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,940
that we use, his name is stan rastow.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,770
Stan listens to witnesses and and

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,180
makes drawings of people that he's never seen.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,800
Sometimes i wonder, though,
if what he draws reflects his life

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,490
as much as it does the witness' description.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,950
Maybe all the thugs that he sketches look like

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,080
the tenth grade gym teacher who
hit him in the face with a basketball.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,810
I wonder about this 'cause,

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,360
well, i see hallucinations of murder victims.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,100
They're not ghosts.
They're just figments of my imagination.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,620
Which means that what i see
in my mind is limited by what i know.

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,420
The first murder victim
i saw was my partner charlie.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,130
Charlie and i worked cases together
for 13 years before he was killed,

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,980
so i can imagine him very clearly.

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,160
But most murder victims i just
see lying there, at the crime scene,

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,360
and most of the time, i can work with that.

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,540
But what happens when i get a murder victim

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,400
and there's nothing much to go on?

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,190
You walked?

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,870
As fast as my little legs could carry me.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,520
Where do you live, detective?

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,000
If i tell you, i'll have to move.
What do we got?

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,830
Male, mid-20s.

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,140
One shot through the chest,
through and through.

26
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,850
Dumped in the canal, maybe over there.

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,260
No footprints, though.
It rained last night and it's all mud.

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,320
- Nobody saw or heard anything.
- Time in the soup?

29
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,430
Less than 24 hours, based on decomposition,
degree of animal intervention.

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,970
Revenge of all the christmas
goldfish dumped in here.

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,970
- Id?
- None.There was a photograph.

32
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,860
- Was?Where is it now?
- At the lab.

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,270
The emulsion was coming off.
They're gonna try to reconstruct it.

34
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,380
There was a map of l.A. Also
at the lab.It was coming apart.

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,500
Anything not at the lab?

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,750
Some papery mush in his right pocket.
Could have been newspaper.

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,100
- I found this in his left pocket.
- What are those?

38
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,370
Rings.

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,610
That's using the old noodle, boyer.

40
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,290
Uh, they gonna be able to
pull fingerprints from the body?

41
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,610
Maybe.

42
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,040
All right, what i'm piecing together here
with my sherlock holmes-like intellect is...

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,620
We have no idea who this guy is.

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,620
And that's a problem for you?

45
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,720
- Not knowing who the victim is?
- Yeah, charlie, a big problem.

46
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,550
We must've pulled a couple dozen cases

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,030
where we didn't know the identity
of the victim at first.

48
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,430
But you still worked your little mojo.

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,080
- Talking to them, cozying up--
- yeah, but that was different.

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,020
You know, that was in my head.

51
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,010
And i'm not in your head?

52
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,600
- Then where the hell am i?
- But i knew you.

53
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,910
You know, i can imagine the hell out of you.

54
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,560
But you don't know anything about this victim.

55
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,350
And because you only see what you know,

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
until you find out more,
that's what you're gonna see.

57
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,280
- That's right.
- His face.

58
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,820
Is that, uh, bad acne or hungry fish?

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,380
Ugh...It's-- just--
just hungry fish.

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,850
I guess you'd better get back to work.

61
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,090
Find out who the hell he is.

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,540
I don't see cops anymore.

66
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,120
- Why not?
- You know why not.They lie.

67
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,420
- Not all cops.
- Oh!Most of them.

68
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,490
Don't you miss it just a little?

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,450
If i missed it, i would still
be doing it.You know that.

70
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,870
I need a favor, samantha.

71
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,300
I told you i owed you one.
Is this the one?

72
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,240
- It is.
- This cop-- is it a

73
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,330
- he, she?
- A he.

74
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,410
Raines.
Detective michael raines.

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,640
So what's his problem?
Does he...

76
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,870
Drink?
Is he depressed?

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,830
He, uh...
He talks to himself.

78
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,520
Yeah, raines has always been...
Different.

79
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,090
His partner, charlie,
used to keep him in check.

80
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,040
He and charlie walked into
something bad a few months ago.

81
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,460
Charlie never made it out.

82
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,180
You ever read that book about lewis and clark?

83
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,070
The stephen ambrose book?
Undaunted courage?

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,790
I have it on my pile.

85
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,940
Made me think of raines.

86
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,770
See, lewis was the visionary.

87
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,590
Clark was the regular guy,
and took care of lewis.

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,410
Charlie took care of raines.

89
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,820
Helped make him the best detective i've got.

90
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,750
Now charlie's gone.

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,200
Are you afraid raines won't be
effective without his partner?

92
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,570
No, i--

93
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,640
at the end of the book, you find out
that after the expedition,

94
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,400
lewis no longer had clark to
take care of him, and, um...

95
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,190
Lewis killed himself.

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,130
Try not to drip on the seat.

97
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,520
Nothing to say for yourself?

98
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,370
- I'm an idiot.
- What would you like me to say?

99
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,540
Um...
Your, your name, for starters.

100
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,740
Hey, what are those things?
What are you doing?

101
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,020
- Maybe i'm a magician.
- You're not very good.

102
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,860
No, you're not very good.

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,710
I'm amazing.

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,040
I don't do comic books, arthur,
i do graphic novels.

105
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,080
If you want richie rich,
get someone else.

106
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,360
If you want sandman or
the dark knight, you want me.

107
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,850
I gotta call you back.

108
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,110
What's wrong with richie rich?
He's a poor little rich boy.

109
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,210
Everybody can relate to that.

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,050
There's nothing wrong with
richie rich.It's just-- it's just

111
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,800
my sarcasm wasn't heavy enough.
It's a snap of our vic.

112
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,560
I need a drawing of what he looked like
before he went into the drink.

113
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,710
It'd just be speculation.

114
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,370
No, speculation would be if i did it.

115
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,340
You, as a forensic artist,
presumably have some expertise.

116
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,130
Unless the good people of
los angeles are, uh,

117
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,960
compensating you under false pretenses.

118
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,540
Not much for the "more flies with honey approach," are you, detective?

119
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,400
Don't want flies, stan.
Flies are a nuisance.

120
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,640
I want a sketch of what this guy looked like.

121
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,740
Which is what you do for money,
ergo, this conversation.

122
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm just saying that it'd be an approximation.

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,080
Hey, you don't do him justice,
he's unlikely to complain.

124
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,450
Maybe you can do a series of drawings,
like a graphic novel.

125
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,590
Put in some weird perspectives,
motion lines, a couple of blams and pows.

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,880
I really thought my sarcasm was easier to read.

127
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,100
Get me something soon.
Sooner, even better.

128
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,000
My pleasure.

129
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,140
It's his job.
What's pleasure got to do with it?

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,960
I believe he was being ironic.

131
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,160
- So he's just being a wisenheimer?
- Takes one, etc.

132
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,480
You got a second?

133
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,400
- Who's, uh, dr.Samantha kohl?
- She's a therapist.

134
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,660
Oh, yeah.Says right here
on the card.Therapist.

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,880
I thought that was "the rapist," which would be
such a strange thing to put on a card.

136
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,750
That's a good one.
You can try that when you see her.

137
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,790
When i what?

138
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,690
You're talking to yourself, michael.

139
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,830
Dan, um, i appreciate the concern, but

140
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,050
did you ever think that
was maybe just my hook?

141
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,520
- Your hook?
- Yeah, i'm the, uh, crazy detective!

142
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,480
"look out!He's nuts!"

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,420
- "wee!"
- i like it.It's good.

144
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,920
You're gonna see her.
She's good.

145
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,530
She used to do post-incident counseling.

146
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,210
She stopped working with cops a while back.

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,090
Why?

148
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,370
Well, you can ask her yourself
during one of your ten sessions.

149
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,630
- Ten?
- Or you're suspended.

150
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,400
Aren't you mr. Cut-to-the-chase.

151
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,960
I'll call her.

152
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,780
Your floater.
Lab pulled prints.

153
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,290
- Any hits?
- He's not in the system.

154
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,180
Or at least not in our system.

155
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,090
Forensic odontologist said the gold bridge
work on the interior teeth

156
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,300
might as well read "made in mexico."

157
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,170
- maybe you should send the prints to mexico.
- Mexico.

158
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,400
Why didn't i think of that?
Oh, wait.I did.

159
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,330
See, i find your sarcasm
very easy to read.

160
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,330
*Ay, ay, ay *

161
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,210
*i'm the frito bandito*

162
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,580
it's so pretty that, that, uh, vibrato.

163
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,640
Is that really the only
mexican song you know?

164
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,440
Macarena.
I know the macarena.

165
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,440
Oh, i can just see you doing that.

166
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,340
Hey, this is my life.

167
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,430
Watching a hallucination do the macarena.
Doesn't get any better than that.

168
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,270
- Sorry, dude.
- Why not?

169
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,450
I don't do chicks' names.
Too much buyer's remorse.

170
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,430
Raines.
What's up, my brother?

171
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,460
Anything, uh, on the guy
they pulled from the canal?

172
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
That's right.
I talk to cops.

173
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,110
Anybody got a problem with that,

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,660
don't bore me with your story
when you're sitting in my chair.

175
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,890
Bet yours'd be worth hearing too.

176
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,570
Still a john doe?

177
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,420
Juan doe now.
Mexican dental work.

178
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,120
Any turbulence in the local latino gangs?

179
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,190
You make him for a banger?

180
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,470
- I don't know.
- Tats?

181
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,810
Not that i see--saw.

182
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,460
Didn't pull up his sleeves.

183
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,660
No tats, no gangster.
Them cats make my nut.

184
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,590
Okay.
If you hear anything...

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,970
Come on, man.You gotta do this.
I told her i'd get it.

186
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,000
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Yes.

187
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,010
Oh, she's way too hot for you.

188
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,320
Listen, do your future a favor,
go down the boardwalk,

189
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,640
get yourself one of those henna tattoos--

190
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,270
they wash right off.

191
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,900
Looks familiar.
Like i've seen him before.

192
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,220
You have seen him before.

193
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,160
On tv.You drew erik estrada.

194
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,810
Is he the only latino you know?

195
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,070
Nice, uh, cultural sensitivity there, stan.

196
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,690
I'm working off a polaroid of
a floater with a half-eaten face!

197
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,920
You drew ponch!

198
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,510
- What's this?
- The map from the vic's pocket.

199
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,370
There was some handwriting along the edge, but the ink ran.

200
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,450
And there were some marks-- looks like x's.

201
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,020
One here, in venice, by the canals.

202
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,110
One here, on washington.
And one here, in macarthur park.

203
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,690
- Macarthur park...
- What?

204
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,080
Why do people go to macarthur park?

205
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,470
Other than for an invigorating stroll?

206
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,090
What, you think he was an illegal
looking to buy a fake id?

207
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,720
You two get in your soft clothes,
print up some copies of that sketch,

208
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,900
and we'll go see if we can find
anybody who knows erik estrada.

209
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,450
Not erik estrada.
Julio santiago.

210
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,800
He comes from the town of sayulita, which is an hour north of puerto vallarta,

211
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,600
and this is his driver's license.

212
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,040
We got a hit off his
prints from mexican dmv.

213
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,980
Oh, that's much better.

214
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,130
Man, here comes a cop, dawg.
I'll catch up with you later.

215
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,450
I like your office.

216
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,500
Lucky you, getting to work
outside in the fresh air.

217
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,280
- You know this guy?
- Well, it's hard to say.

218
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,410
What would make it less hard?

219
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,360
I don't know.
A hundred bucks might help.

220
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,320
You get, what, 300 for a set of
fake driver's, social, green card?

221
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,900
Tell me what i want to know,

222
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,670
i won't hang around here all day,
chasing off prospective customers.

223
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,760
All right.
Guy come up to me the other day.

224
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,620
Didn't speak no english.
He wasn't looking for an id.

225
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,570
Had a clipping, some cut
out of a mexican newspaper.

226
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,090
He needs help finding the guy.
So i gave him a card to a notario.

227
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,850
Which notario?

228
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,000
- This notario.
- Really?

229
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,060
Ram fuentes.
Washington boulevard.

230
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,190
That's the one.
And do me a favor.

231
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,930
Don't tell him i gave you that.
Please.

232
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,700
That's my credo: never inconvenience
or upset a weasel who exploits people.

233
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,010
Thank you very much.
Have a good day.

234
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,750
Can't believe it, man.
Messin' with my business like that.

235
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,770
He says you don't, uh, speak english.
Please tell me that's not true.

236
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,630
- eu?
- Fantastic.

237
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,490
You're not gonna be very much fun to talk to.

238
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,600
But you're not a ghost.
You're a hallucination.

239
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,350
You come out of my head.

240
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,610
I had you talking english before.

241
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,580
You could, uh, blab in farsi if i knew it.

242
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,760
- Took you long enough.
- I'm so sorry.

243
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:48,980
I-- i'm just getting the hang of
exactly how it is i've lost my mind.

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,040
There's a reason people come here.

245
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,800
Look at that.
It's beautiful in mexico too.

246
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,380
- Parts.
- Yeah, here's where the money is, huh?

247
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,580
No, it's more than that.

248
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,690
This is california.
You from here?

249
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,510
- You know where i'm from.
- Play along.

250
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,750
I'm from new york city.
I came here after high school.

251
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,440
Guess i read, uh, too much
raymond chandler when i was a teenager.

252
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,370
- You stayed.
- Well...

253
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,320
You spend one february out here,
it's hard to go back.

254
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,790
It's not all this pretty, you know.

255
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,350
I know.

256
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,960
But this is why you still drive along mulholl
and when you know the freeway would be faster.

257
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,870
You love it here.

258
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,860
Well, don't tell anybody.

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,770
Raines.

260
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,870
Our unis were canvassing with julio's picture

261
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,520
and they got a hit from
the catholic church on brixton.

262
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,110
Oh, i'm near brixton.
I'll be-- i'll be there soon.

263
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,330
- I can't believe he's dead.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,460
- H-how long did he stay here?
- Just a couple nights.

265
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,940
Couple of nights.
Did he say why he was here?

266
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,830
I just assumed he was here
for a better life.

267
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,300
A, uh, macarthur park id counterfeiter
said julio was looking for somebody.

268
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,690
Really?I thought it was more like
he was looking to avoid someone.

269
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,990
The coyote that brought them north.

270
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,260
- Julio owed him money.
- Huh...

271
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,130
You know this, uh, coyote?

272
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,510
I know people who know people...

273
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,960
Wait a minute.
You said, brought "them" north?

274
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,210
Julio wasn't alone?

275
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,220
- He was with maria and the baby.
- Who's-- who's maria?

276
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,160
- His wife.
- And the baby?

277
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,510
His son.

278
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,360
Oh, man, i did not see that one coming.
Did you?

279
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,280
Look at me.
I'm a daddy.

280
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,510
Gracias a dios.

281
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,430
raines, lapd.

282
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,320
Look what you did.
And i was winning.

283
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,840
No, you weren't.
You know this guy?

284
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,250
You know i do, or you wouldn't be here.

285
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,750
You brought him across the border?

286
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,300
He still owes me money for that.

287
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,390
He's dead.

288
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,410
- Good.
- Good?

289
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,040
Now you won't get your money.

290
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,920
Hazards of the trade.

291
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,440
Can i get you something?

292
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,670
Agua?
Cerveza?

293
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,710
Maybe an ice cold fresca?

294
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,230
Oh, i-- i used to like fresca.

295
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,360
Hey, did you know that,
uh, lbj had fresca on tap at the white house?

296
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,020
That's true.
Maybe you killed him.

297
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,960
- Lbj?
- Julio santiago.

298
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm not in that business.

299
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,270
No, you'll cram people into an airless trunk,

300
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,570
then drive them through 100-degree temperatures,

301
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,410
abandon the sick and the elderly
in the desert, but you don't kill people.

302
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,350
I provide you with a service, ese.

303
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,020
- Me?
- Who cleans your house?

304
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,210
Nobody.
It's an issue with the landlord.

305
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,500
- Mows your lawn?
- Grass is all dead.

306
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,940
Who parks your cars at restaurants,
washes them on the weekend?

307
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,690
You eat strawberries, ese?

308
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,050
Grapes?
Guacamole?

309
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,710
I like the guacamole.

310
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,530
That, uh-- that's the good fat.

311
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,210
I need to find the woman who was with julio.
The one with the baby.

312
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,060
L.A.Is a big city, detective.

313
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,020
You see can it at night when
you're flying in, it goes on forever.

314
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,610
How am i supposed to know where she is?

315
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,610
I was told that maria came to you,
looking for a ride home.

316
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,850
Maybe i gave her bus fare
and she's back in mexico.

317
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,010
Or, maybe, 'cause she still owes you money,

318
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,610
you've got her stashed in a
garage somewhere, working it off.

319
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,600
How much does she still owe you?

320
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,610
Y *a fue la *tima vez que lo vi.

321
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,260
And that was the last that she saw of him.

322
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,350
Ah, gracias.

323
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,990
Look at you.
Practically bilingual.

324
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,920
Michael?

325
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,860
They weren't here to stay.
They were tourists.

326
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,680
Julio worked three jobs, uh,

327
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,860
to make enough money to take
maria and the baby to disneyland.

328
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,650
It was his gift to her,
after having the baby.

329
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,560
Yeah, i'm confused.
They were illegal mexican tourists?

330
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,920
A lot of them come up to see relatives,
then--then head right back.

331
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,280
Ah.Your id guy said julio
was looking for someone.

332
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,340
She didn't know anything about that.

333
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,910
Their money'd run out a couple of days ago.
They were gonna head out tomorrow.

334
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,300
Julio left her and the baby
at the church last night,

335
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,310
didn't say where he was going.
He never came back.

336
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,590
No idea who he was looking for?

337
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,070
I'm gonna check up on a, uh,
lead tomorrow morning.

338
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,010
Ramo fuentes.A notario.
Julio was given his card.

339
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,880
And where are they gonna stay tonight?

340
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,210
Hey, maria.I'll take, uh,
the couch out here.

341
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,930
And, uh, you and the baby,

342
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,550
please, take my, uh--
sleep in the bedroom.

343
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,190
How do you say-- i'll show you.
I wish i could--

344
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,190
you want me to translate?

345
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,410
Okay.

346
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,010
El lago titicaca, entre las resplicas de peru

347
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,610
Y bolivia, es el mar alto de todo el mundo.

348
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,890
Two years of high school spanish and all you
remember is something about lake titicaca?

349
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,970
It's a funny word.
Titicaca.

350
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,230
Oh.

351
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,790
Maria...

352
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,990
****...These are?

353
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,410
Mira!

354
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,690
- Gracias.
- Okay.

355
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,350
Who are you calling?

356
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,050
Uh...Nobody.
I wanna talk to you.

357
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,530
She doesn't know what i'm saying.

358
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,640
You ever stop to wonder
what the hell happened to you?

359
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,860
Oh, every single damn day.

360
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,010
So i'm not the wide-eyed immigrant
who came here for a better life.

361
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,740
Maybe.

362
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,750
But you were looking for somebody,
and you didn't wanna tell your wife.

363
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,300
Why not?

364
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,360
Julio, what's your--
what's you secret?

365
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,880
No sinore.
No hablo ingles.

366
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,160
Very funny.

367
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm sorry, detective, but as you can see, i'm very busy.

368
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,290
Paciencia, amigos.

369
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,880
Los atender?
En un momento, eh?

370
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,830
Did i mention that i was with the,
uh, los angeles police department?

371
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,370
No, esp*ense. ****
D* de se van?

372
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,470
Well, it looks like your,
your morning has just opened up.

373
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,760
What can i do for you, detective?

374
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,440
Thank you.This man.
I know he came here.

375
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,420
He had a picture of somebody
in a mexican newspaper.

376
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,220
- I couldn't help him.
- Couldn't or wouldn't?

377
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,400
Well, i'm not a charity organization.

378
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,750
No, you're too busy scamming the desperate.

379
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,420
I provide a service.

380
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,450
Charging illegals thousands
to file asylum applications

381
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,280
that not only have no
chance of going through,

382
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,810
they alert the authorities
to your clients' presence.

383
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,680
Which gets them conveniently deported
before they can sue you for fraud.

384
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,930
Nice service.

385
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,260
It didn't matter in the long run, did it?

386
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,860
He probably got what
he wanted for free anyway.

387
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,500
H-he could've walked up to anybody
on the street around here,

388
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,320
shown them that newspaper clipping
and been pointed in the right direction.

389
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,110
- Who was in the clipping?
- That guy...

390
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,470
The-- always in the news.
The anti-immigration guy.

391
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,300
He's a city councilman.

392
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,570
Aurelio s*nchez.

393
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,630
Here we go.
Aurelio s*nchez.

394
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,590
- Here's his website.
- Everybody's got a website.

395
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,430
He's our city councilman.
Of course he has a website.

396
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,470
- You think he's got a myspace page?
- What?

397
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,040
I saw this one the other night.
The guy starts out all normal--

398
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,080
you know, likes, uh, pina coladas,
walks in the rain, all that crap.

399
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,070
And then, under likes and dislikes,
he puts, he likes to eat spiders.

400
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,650
I swear to god.
I checked it five times.

401
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,410
Did he really write that?
Yup.Likes to eat spiders.

402
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,130
- And i'm thinking this guy--
- boyer, do you have a, a myspace page?

403
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,410
No, not yet.

404
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,240
Great, so, so when you get one, may i suggest
that under likes and dislikes, you put

405
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,770
that you like to annoy the living snot
out of people when they're trying to work.

406
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,330
And maybe you wanna add a link to

407
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,810
www.What in god's name is wrong with me--
all one word-- dot com?

408
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,210
Yeah.

409
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,970
What do we got?

410
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,430
Oh, photo gallery,press, bio, links.

411
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,360
Bring up his bio.

412
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,960
Michael?

413
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,130
- Do you want me to print it up?
- Yeah.Um...

414
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,030
And dig a little, see, see, uh,

415
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,180
what else you can find out about councilman s*nchez.

416
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,640
Aurelio s*nchez?
Our city councilman?

417
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,760
Our vic was looking for him.

418
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,150
Oh, yeesh.That's all we need.
Do you like him for this?

419
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,280
- I don't like anybody.
- I was referring to the case.

420
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,210
Ah, that's amusing.
You missed your calling.

421
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,060
Close the door.

422
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,580
I find you devastatingly attractive as well,

423
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,530
- but we must be
- strong and resist.

424
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,220
Close the door.

425
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,320
You haven't called dr.Kohl.

426
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,690
Dan, it's been one day.

427
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,360
I haven't called my, uh, mother in weeks.
You don't hear her complaining.

428
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,120
Your mother's dead.

429
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,100
That explains it.

430
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,340
Michael.
I wasn't kidding before.

431
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,730
You see dr.Kohl ten times or you're suspended.

432
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,170
- I'll call her.
- Will you, michael?

433
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,040
I mean, what are you afraid of?

434
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,620
That she's gonna tell you you're crazy?
Because we've known that for years.

435
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,760
Here you go.

436
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,590
- Hey, i found out a few things.
- Call me in the car.

437
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,900
- Why don't you like me?
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

438
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,740
It's because i told the captain that
i saw you talking to yourself on the boudreau case,

439
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,150
- isn't it?
- I-i disliked you way before that.

440
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,670
Did you ever stop to think that maybe
i had a good reason to tell the captain?

441
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,100
What the hell would that be?

442
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,050
You've always been something
of a whackjob, detective.

443
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,480
But you always had charlie
to help you cinch the restraints,

444
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,400
to keep you from swallowing your tongue.

445
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,490
Now?

446
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,600
Let's put it this way:

447
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,340
i see people out on the street
every day talking to themselves.

448
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,950
The one big difference between them and you?

449
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,690
They don't have a license to carry a firearm.

450
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,200
Ever see this guy?

451
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,400
Mm.
Sorry.

452
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,230
Never seen him before.

453
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,900
Why would he be looking for me?

454
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,220
I was hoping that you could
shed some light on that.

455
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,530
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

456
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,910
Um, we printed up the bio from your website.

457
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,390
Nothing here that explains why you're so
stridently and vocally anti-immigration.

458
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,510
Ah, but i'm not.
I'm anti-illegal immigration.

459
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm all for the legal variety.

460
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,450
Increase it.Get the, uh,
guest worker program going now.

461
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,870
But you already knew that.

462
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,450
You just wanted to zing me withhe fact

463
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,440
that i was at one time an
illegal immigrant myself.Right?

464
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,950
Oh, pretty much.Doesn't say anything
about your old status in the bio.

465
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,230
Well, it says i came north in '84

466
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,680
and benefited from the reagan amnesty in '86.
but does it ever say,

467
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,120
"city councilman aurelio s*nchez
was once an illegal alien"?No.

468
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,210
Not is so many words.

469
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,050
I know what you're thinking, detective,
that i'm a shut-the-door-behind-me type.

470
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,390
"i got mine, now you all go back home."

471
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,780
but that's not it at all.

472
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,290
In the 20-odd years i've been here,
it's completely changed.

473
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,230
It's a multi-billion dollar criminal enterprise now.

474
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,670
You got coyotes, brokers,
on both sides of the border.

475
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,960
The gangs are all over it now.

476
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,700
Used to be, it was just people...

477
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,000
You know, people like me,
looking for a better life.

478
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,640
Now it's thousands upon thousands

479
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,780
looking to make an easy buck

480
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,580
and bring their families with them.

481
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,020
Yeah, you didn't bring your family with you.

482
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,180
I didn't have one.

483
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,630
My parents died in a car crash when i was 16.

484
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,550
and you weren't married?

485
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,100
I had a girlfriend,
but she didn't wanna come.

486
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,700
She was...One of the reasons i left actually.

487
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,720
I kissed her best friend at a party

488
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,700
and she said she never wanted to see me again.

489
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,960
That's not in your bio either.

490
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,350
I'll update it tomorrow.

491
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,480
Yeah.
Where do you live, by the way?

492
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,980
On bywater.
It's one of the canals.

493
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,340
Oh, i know it well.
I'm on-- i'm on crane.

494
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,860
- Nice.
- Yeah,

495
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,400
it wasn't so nice when i first--
first moved in there.

496
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:03,000
No idea why somebody would come
all the way from mexico here to see you?

497
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:07,020
I honestly don't have the slightest idea.

498
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,410
Maybe an old friend back in, uh-- back home?

499
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,420
Detective, this is my home.

500
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,180
But to answer your question, uh,

501
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,870
given my rather public
position on certain issues,

502
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,120
i don't have any friends left in mexico.

503
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,030
No friends in mexico?

504
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,900
That's putting it mildly.
They hate him down there.

505
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,010
He's a, uh, los angeles city councilman.

506
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,540
A city councilman with a mexican last name

507
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,550
who gets his picture in the
paper and his face on tv.

508
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,880
He's going after the coyotes,
and the brokers, and the notarios--

509
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,630
all the people that make a lot of
money off illegal immigration.

510
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,320
He's bad for business.
And business is big.

511
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,700
Uh, raines.

512
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,560
Uh-huh...

513
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,130
What?

514
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,370
My, my...

515
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,310
Yeah, i do indeed.
Uh...

516
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,530
I'll be there in ten minutes.

517
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,940
Hey, these people in mexico,

518
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,120
would they be angry enough at
councilman s*nchez to do something about it?

519
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,610
Well, like i said, he's bad for business.

520
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,560
Bad enough so as that they'd send
somebody across the border to kill him?

521
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,840
Our first hit on the victim's
prints came from the mexican dmv.

522
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,230
Now we got one from the federales.

523
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,270
Julio's in their system too.

524
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Didn't pop at first because the record's sealed.

525
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,330
- Your vic had a criminal record?
- Yeah.

526
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,450
Guess we now know why i was here, compadre.

527
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,910
Detective, i am a city councilman--

528
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,270
yeah, which is why you're
here in the captain's office

529
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,950
and not down in interrogation.

530
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,230
And why would i be in interrogation?

531
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,290
Because you weren't entirely
forthcoming, were you?

532
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,130
I asked you if you could think of a reason

533
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,540
why somebody from mexico
would come here looking for you.

534
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,280
You didn't tell me that
you thought you were in danger.

535
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,630
- I'm not in danger.
- Your assistant said you got death threats.

536
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,870
I think "death threats" is
a little overly dramatic."

537
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,760
"stop speaking against the coyotes
or we will stop you."

538
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,710
- Which could be interpreted--
- "shut up or die."

539
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,880
we know that julio santiago
was looking for you.

540
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,970
We know that he was a criminal.

541
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,770
His records are sealed,

542
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,200
which often means that
he was a very, very bad man.

543
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,560
We know that you are licensed
to carry a gun.

544
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,690
We know that your house is a block
away from where the body was found.

545
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,950
- We know you have no alibi--
- i was working late.

546
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,370
By yourself, which equals no alibi.

547
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,690
We're gonna have forensics
go over your house with a microscope.

548
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,150
Go ahead.I didn't have anything
to do with this.

549
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,550
If i had, i'd tell you.

550
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,060
I'd tell the world.

551
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
What?

552
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,530
I'd tell them i will defend
my life and my family,

553
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,570
and i will not be intimidated.

554
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,440
I'd tell them i'm an american citizen

555
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,170
and will speak my mind about whatever
i feel, without fear of retribution.

556
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,610
That's what i would say if i had anything to do

557
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,870
with the death of this, uh, mexican assassin.

558
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,830
But i didn't.

559
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,910
What about the gun?

560
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,530
He turned it over, but with no bullet
in julio's chest, that's meaningless.

561
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,230
All right, well, maybe we'll
find blood in the house.

562
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,020
I doubt it.

563
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,920
He wouldn't have been so
sanguine about us checking it

564
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,600
if there was anything there to find.

565
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,290
It probably happened outside.
The, uh, pros like to work the shadows.

566
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,200
Then we'll find blood outside.

567
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,510
Still struggling with the short-term
memory, aren't you, boyer?

568
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,900
It rained that night.
Any blood is long gone.

569
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,840
Any dna is in the canal.

570
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,710
Why would s*nchez dump the body?
I mean, say you're him.

571
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,500
You receive death threats,

572
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,250
you have a permit to carry weapons,

573
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,690
some guy tries to whack you,
you get him first.That's self-defense.

574
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,370
Was the lab ever able to do anything
with that photo in julio's pocket?

575
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,900
I'll check.

576
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,710
- I gotta go.
- Where?

577
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,230
Uh, my pilates class.

578
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,930
Find me julio's arresting officer in mexico.

579
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,430
- I wanna know what julio did.
- Good luck.

580
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,380
Where's the love?

581
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,970
You didn't say a word the whole ride over.

582
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,000
Uh, you're a hit man.
You got what you deserved.

583
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,470
Then why not close the file and move on?

584
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,920
Ah, yes.The little rat-like nibbling of doubt.

585
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,780
Por favor, share with the class.

586
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,400
A hit man who brings his
wife and child to disneyland

587
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,820
- and then goes to make a hit?
- Maybe i'm not a pro.

588
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,640
Guy like him, he's probably
not worth a stone-killer.

589
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,610
They get me cheap.
You know i needed the money.

590
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,240
Maybe.

591
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,950
How come you don't wanna go talk to the shrink lady?

592
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,420
My secrets.I have so many
shameful, dirty secrets.

593
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,580
It's a pain in the ass.

594
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,380
Every time a cop pulls his gun or trips on s shoelace,

595
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,970
he's gotta go see a shrink.
It's a waste of time.

596
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,660
Yeah, but this isn't because you tripped
over your shoelaces, is it, michael?

597
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,140
No, this is because you talk to
projected figments of your imagination.

598
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,460
- Thank you very, very much.
- Maybe you need a little help, compadre.

599
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,760
Always nice to get advice
from a killer for hire.

600
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,610
- Just saying...
- Yeah, if, if i need help,

601
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,240
uh, it's certainly not gonna be
from somebody who sees cops for a living.

602
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,610
You know, i've seen enough of them over the years.

603
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,260
I know how to handle them.

604
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,540
So they told me, um...

605
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,290
You don't see, uh, cops anymore.
How come?

606
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,610
Most cops don't believe in therapy.

607
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,930
- Do you?
- Oh.

608
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,270
Well, freud's only stated goal was to convert

609
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,180
"hysterical misery into common unhappiness."

610
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,330
i'm already unhappy.
Nothing more a therapist can do for me.

611
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,880
- Why are you unhappy?
- Uh...

612
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,480
Nice try.

613
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,400
Not a freudian, by the way.
Jungian.

614
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,910
Oh, archetypes, collective unconscious, symbols.

615
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,570
- That's my training.
- Hmm.So--

616
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,810
if you, uh, don't see cops anymore,
how come you're seeing me?

617
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,320
- Your captain asked me.
- Why'd you agree?

618
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,870
Does he have a picture of you with a goat?

619
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,990
not a goat.

620
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,930
- You talk to yourself, detective?
- Yes.

621
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,440
Um, i can't think of anybody
more interesting to talk to.

622
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,230
My gosh, i'm a narcissist.

623
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,350
Tell me about yourself.

624
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,080
I was born in an aleutian fishing village.

625
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,610
My hobbies include making wax models
of my favorite internal organs and skee-ball.

626
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,910
You-- aren't you gonna write this down?

627
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,410
I know what you're thinking--

628
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,710
you were right to stop seeing cops.

629
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,670
Let me assure of something:

630
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,860
i don't work for the city.I don't
work for the department.Not anymore.

631
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,640
My goal is not to find you nuts
and get you suspended.

632
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,100
If anything, i'd rather help you integrate

633
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,190
whatever private hell you've been
going through so you can be a better cop.

634
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,890
You wanna make me a better cop?
Fantastic.

635
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,170
Tell me about yourself.

636
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,020
What, uh, what would you like to know?

637
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,520
- Where did you grow up?
- New york.

638
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,940
- Parents?
- One of each.

639
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,340
Tell me about them.

640
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,600
Uh, my dad was a transit cop.

641
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,400
My mother was a school teacher.

642
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,600
One brother.
Older.

643
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,890
Mark...

644
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,180
What?

645
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,460
And the boat was going under, and, um...

646
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,690
Mark, he couldn't hold on, and i'm--

647
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,380
i'm yelling, "mark!Mark!Hold on!"

648
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,630
and then, then he was gone...

649
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,450
And i just can't help thinking
that it should've been me.

650
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,150
I'm afraid that's all the time that we have.

651
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,390
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.Next patient.

652
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,230
Wow.

653
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,610
I--i think we really did some...

654
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,760
Some good work here today.

655
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,730
Should we-- should we make an appointment?

656
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,870
Call me when you know your schedule.

657
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,690
Just one thing.

658
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,230
Next time, i would really appreciate it if you didn't waste my time.

659
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,520
Did you really think i would buy that?

660
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,250
You stole the whole brother drowning
story right out of ordinary people.

661
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,120
Did you think i wouldn't pick up on that?

662
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,490
Do you think i'm stupid?

663
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,150
Look, i know you're good
at gaming the shrinks.

664
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,430
That's what you cops do.

665
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,380
Point of information, detective,
my ex-husband was a cop.

666
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,620
So i know all the tricks.

667
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,780
Which means that you can't game me.

668
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,690
You don't wanna be here?
Fine.

669
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,600
I don't want you here either.

670
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:55,130
Unfortunately, we have no choice.
You're here for nine more hours.

671
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,720
So in the future, if you don't
wanna take this seriously,

672
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,150
i would rather you sit in silence for the hour.

673
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,230
I can do my taxes, my nails, whatever.

674
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,670
Just don't waste my time.

675
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,070
Okay?

676
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,260
- You did great.
- Shut up.

677
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,530
Hey, i just got off the phone with
officer rao batista from sayulita.

678
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,880
He gave me a peek into julio's sealed file.

679
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,020
How'd you manage that?

680
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,200
Let's just say next time i'm south of the border,

681
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,500
officer batista will be expecting
me to go "south of the border."

682
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,890
- really?
- No, you creep.I just asked.

683
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,690
It was no big deal.

684
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,430
Julio's records were sealed
because he was a juvenile

685
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,040
when he committed his heinous act.

686
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,050
He took a neighbor's horse so he could
give his girlfriend a ride on the beach.

687
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,840
Officer batista laughed when i asked him
if julio might've been a hit man.

688
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,110
Then he cried when i told him julio was dead.

689
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,350
- You don't have to say it.
- I won't.

690
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,370
It's my, my job to think the worst of people.

691
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,600
- Some job.
- It's all i've got.

692
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,240
Detective?

693
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,030
The lab sent over the photo from julio's pocket.

694
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,040
It's julio.
Looks like it.

695
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,580
- Except--
- except...

696
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,180
Who carries around a picture of themselves?

697
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,360
Well...

698
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,750
Uh, carolyn, uh, call back your boyfriend, officer batista.

699
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,910
Ask him for, uh, the numbers of
julio's family, especially his mother.

700
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,050
Now, get this back to the lab.
I need them to run a test.

701
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,570
What kind of test?

702
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,300
I need to know how old that photograph is.

703
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,660
I know what happened.

704
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,630
Hey!

705
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,670
Oh, detective.
You surprised me.

706
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,310
Did he surprise you as much as i just did?

707
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,100
Who?

708
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,210
Julio santiago.
The, uh, hit man from mexico.

709
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,630
I think it's time you started
to talk to my lawyer.

710
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,650
You pissed off the coyotes.
They made death threats.

711
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,240
You were worried about your family,
had them moved out of town--

712
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,230
- we've been over this--
- julio santiago found out where you lived.

713
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,360
Two nights ago, you were
getting out of your car,

714
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:53,260
it was late, he stepped out of
the shadows, he called your name.

715
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,970
He reached for his gun.
You reached for yours.

716
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,780
And you reached faster.

717
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,380
It was a lucky shot.
Or, unlucky, if you're julio santiago.

718
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,410
Your first thought was to call the police,

719
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,970
'cause this was justified,
this was righteous.

720
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,080
But then you saw his hand
was empty.No gun.

721
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,860
You still could've called the police,
but you didn't.

722
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,440
Instead, you looked around.
Nobody saw you.

723
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:22,160
You dragged the hit man's body
a block away and dumped him.

724
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,270
- You should've been a writer.
- Maybe when i retire.

725
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,830
I think maybe i can help you with that.

726
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,120
Once my lawyers get hold of this,
you'll be begging to retire.

727
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,490
He wasn't a hit man, aurelio.

728
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,240
Julio santiago came here with his wife and his baby.

729
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,340
He took them to disneyland.

730
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,340
The baby was the key.
That's why he came here to see you.

731
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,420
- To show you the baby.
- Show me the baby?

732
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,330
He didn't tell his wife maria that that
was the real reason why he came here,

733
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,910
- 'cause he wasn't sure.
- Sure about what?

734
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,110
The girlfriend...

735
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,460
That you left in mexico 22 years ago--

736
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,920
the girlfriend who didn't
wanna see you anymore--

737
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,870
she was pregnant when you left.

738
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:16,520
I am so sorry, aurelio,
but julio santiago...

739
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,310
Was your son.

740
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,560
There was no gun.

741
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,340
I thought i was ruined.

742
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,620
I may have been here 20 years,

743
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,400
but my skin is still brown,
my name is still s*nchez.

744
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:41,270
It would destroy my career, my, my family...

745
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,960
I knew he had a gun!
I just knew he had a gun!

746
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:51,840
He--he--he-- he looked right at me
and he reached into his pocket.

747
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,840
Why would he do that?

748
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,430
He was reaching for that.

749
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,160
It was almost ruined by the water,
but, uh, our lab restored it.

750
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,970
They did a good job.
Uh, they tell me it's 25 years old.

751
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,930
Who is that?

752
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,240
Oh, my god.

753
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,760
That's me.

754
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,810
And my son.

755
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,800
My--my poor son.

756
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,580
No, no, no.
Thank you so much.Please.

757
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:57,840
Aurelio, your son came
all this way for a reason.

758
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,560
Would you like to meet your grandson?

759
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,410
I would.

760
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,550
Aurelio, this is your daughter-in-law, maria.

761
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,310
Maria.I am so sorry.
I didn't know.

762
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,500
She doesn't speak english.

763
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,320
Ah, perdon.

764
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,250
Lo siento, este...

765
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,190
No hay nada por hacer.

766
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,020
Con permiso.
Por favor.

767
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,550
Ay, hijito.
Oh, mi hijito.

768
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,620
Eh, mi hijo.
Ay, mi hijito.
Oh.

769
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,620
Eh!
Oh!

770
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,190
- como se llama?
- Aurelio.

771
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,700
So what do you think he'll get?

772
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,610
Manslaughter, evidence tampering?

773
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,070
Significant time, but, uh,

774
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,380
given the circumstances,
not as much as he might've.

775
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,450
as for Maria and the baby...

776
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm not asking, and you're not telling.

777
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,800
If you're gonna let an illegal
immigrant and her baby go free,

778
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,080
i don't wanna know about it.

779
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,460
She wants to go back to mexico.
That's where her family is.

780
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,080
She's gonna take julio back there to be buried.

781
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,110
We're, we're paying for it out of the victims' fund.

782
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,060
Wow, we really are the good guys some times.

783
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,270
So how's it going with dr.Kohl?

784
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,400
- Frankly?
- Uh, horrible.

785
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,770
Why?
She saw right through your crap?

786
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,790
She tell you?

787
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,200
No, she's not telling me anything.
I just know you, and i know your crap.

788
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,150
You didn't tell me her ex was a cop.

789
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,720
Dickie burrus, narcotics.

790
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,930
Oh-ho, really?
No wonder she hates cops.

791
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,530
So w-what do you have on her?

792
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,970
- What do i have on her?
- I know she doesn't want to see me.

793
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,980
You must have something on her.
What is it?

794
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,900
A picture of her with a goat?

795
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,520
Not a goat.

796
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,930
What does that mean?

797
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,200
Not a goat?

798
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,490
- No.
- W-wait.Wait!
